The complaint
Mr D complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA accepted a buyers return claim for an 
item he sold online, without clear justification, resulting in him incurring additional costs.
What happened
Mr D maintains an account with PayPal which he uses when selling items using an online 
shopping forum.
In January 2021, Mr D sold a smart doorbell device and received payment through PayPals 
service. He stated that he would only accept returns in the event that the item was not as 
described or faulty. 
Shortly after the transaction was completed, the purchaser made a claim through PayPals 
Buyer Protection service. They said that the item sold was advertised as new but was 
actually used. Mr D replied to the purchaser. He didnt agree that the item was used. He 
knew that itd been supplied by the manufacturer as a replacement item with all packaging 
and seals in place. 
The purchaser then changed the claim reason and said that the item was faulty. So, Mr D 
replied to the purchaser to establish the problem. The purchaser said that theyd contacted 
the manufacturer who told them that the item wasnt suitable for their internet speed. Mr D 
said that this didnt represent a fault. So, he suggested that the purchaser return the item to 
him so that he could test it. He said that if there was a fault, he would make a full refund.
On receipt, Mr D tested the item. He also took photographs as evidence that the item was 
new. He didnt find a fault. So, he told the purchaser that he wouldnt refund the amount paid 
and theyd have to arrange redelivery to them.
Mr D also contacted PayPal and provided the photographs and testing outcomes to support 
his findings. But PayPal upheld the purchasers return claim. They also charged Mr D a 
dispute fee of £12. Mr D wasnt happy with PayPals actions here. So, he complained to 
them. He wanted them to refund the dispute fee. He then incurred a relisting fee of £14.24 
with the online shopping forum. He wanted PayPal to reimburse that as well.
PayPal responded to Mr Ds complaint in February 2021. They didnt agree that theyd done 
anything wrong. They said that the Billing Dispute has been successfully resolved. Mr D 
was unhappy with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at Mr Ds complaint. She didnt think that PayPal had acted 
fairly here. She said that PayPal should refund the additional costs that Mr D incurred and 
also pay £50 for the inconvenience caused to him. 
PayPal didnt agree with our investigators view. They said that this type of claim is not
eligible for Seller Protection. They also referred to their terms and conditions for 
Reversals. They asked that the complaint be referred to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The purchaser originally submitted their claim on the basis that the items was Not as 
described. The purchaser said that the item was advertised as new but was actually used. 
PayPals conditions for such a claim are available on their website. They say that a claim 
can be made where the condition of the item is misrepresented. 
Mr D said that the item sold was new. He also provided photographic evidence to support 
this claim. While Ive not been able to confirm the authenticity of the photographs provided, 
Ive not seen anything to persuade me that the item was anything other than as Mr D 
described.
The purchaser then changed the claim on the basis that the item was faulty. PayPals 
conditions say that acceptable reasons include where:
The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the 
description of the item
The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.
There is nothing in the evidence that Ive seen that leads me to believe that the item sold 
was faulty. Having considered the communication notes between PayPal, the purchaser and 
Mr D, I cant see that any specific evidence was provided by the purchaser to support this 
claim.
PayPals online dispute resolution process is explained on their website. They suggest If 
youre unable to resolve a transaction related dispute issue directly with the seller, you must 
follow our online dispute resolution processEscalate the dispute to a claim for 
reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute if you and the seller are unable to 
come to an agreementRespond to PayPals request for documentation or other 
information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for 
reimbursement. PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police 
reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.
The contact notes provided appear to demonstrate that Mr D did, at all times, try to assist the 
purchaser in establishing why the item purchased wouldnt work for him. The notes suggest 
that the purchasers broadband service didnt meet the technical requirements of the product 
purchased. Mr D said that the product literature and the manufacturers website clearly detail 
those requirements. Mr D also offered to test the device for faults. He completed the tests 
and provided device health/activity reports which appear to show that the device had no 
apparent faults. 
So, based upon all of the information and evidence provided, Ive found nothing to support 
the purchasers claims that the item sold was either Not as described or faulty. So, In the 
absence of any compelling evidence from the purchaser, I can find no apparent reason why 
PayPal shouldve upheld this claim.
In order to reach my decision, I wanted to understand, more clearly, PayPals reasons for 
upholding the purchasers claim here. Mr D had previously asked PayPal to explain why 
theyd reached the decision they did. But I cant see that PayPal ever provided this to him.
So, I also asked PayPal to provide a clear explanation to me of how they found in favour of 
the purchaser, rather than Mr D, in this case, and how the decision was communicated to Mr 
D. They said Seller Protection is relevant in this case as Mr D acted as the seller. Buyer
Protection only applies to the buyer (the person who filed the case against Mr D).
Buyer Protection cannot apply to Mr D in this case as he was the seller, (the party
who sold the original item and received the original transaction in question).Buyer protection and seller protection are completely different policies which apply to
the appropriate party depending on which role they played in the transaction.
It isnt the role of this service to comment or make judgement upon the terms, conditions and 
policies adopted by PayPal in these circumstances. But it is our role to establish whether 
these have been applied in a fair and reasonable way to all parties concerned. Where a 
claim is made by a purchaser under PayPals Buyer Protection, the outcome decided will 
always impact on both the buyer and the seller, whether positively or negatively. So, its 
important that any claim is assessed in a way that it fair and reasonable to both parties.
Based upon what Ive seen, I agree with our investigator. I dont think that PayPal have 
acted fairly here. I havent seen any evidence provided by the purchaser to adequately 
support their claims. I also think that its fair and reasonable for Mr D, as the seller, to have 
the opportunity to provide any evidence necessary to defend the claims made by the 
purchaser. Thats what he did here. But despite Mr Ds and my own request, PayPal have 
failed to adequately explain how they reached their decision in this dispute. 
Putting things right
Given these circumstances, I shall be asking PayPal to put things right by reimbursing Mr D. 
I also agree with our investigator that PayPal should pay compensation of £50 to Mr D in 
respect of the inconvenience this situation has caused him  
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Ds complaint. I require PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA to:
Refund the £12 dispute fee to Mr D.
Pay Mr D £14.24 in respect of the relisting charges he incurred as a result.
Pay Mr D compensation of £50 in respect of the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2021.
