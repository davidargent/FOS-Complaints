K822xcomplaint
Mrs P complains that JD Williams (JDW) was irresponsible to lend to her by increasing her 
credit limit multiple times.
background 
Mrs P held catalogue shopping  accounts  with JDW under the Simply  Be and Viva La Diva
brands. I will deal with both those accounts in this decision.
Mrs P says JDW should never  have  increased her credit  limits  as she was only making the 
minimum repayments and JDW  should have known she wouldnt be able to repay the 
balance within a reasonable  period of time.  She adds  that if JDW had properly checked her 
credit file it would  also have seen she had a poor credit record,  including late payments and 
defaults.
JDW says it checked Mrs Ps credit file and increased her credit  limit in line with how she 
managed her account. It says her payments were generally kept up to date, but there  were  
occasions when  they were  late and, as a result  of non-payment, her account was defaulted 
in July 2010. It says Mrs P settled the account in March 2012.
JDW adds that, due to a policy change, four of Mrs Ps late payment charges would no 
longer have been applied,  so it offered to refund these as a goodwill gesture. It says it sent a 
cheque for £60.50 to refund these, plus the £12.50 credit on her account.
Mrs P says her debt was sold to a third party in March 2012 and it took her a few years to 
clear via a debt management company.  She adds that JDWs response only addressed  her 
complaint about  one of her accounts.
Consumer Credit came under the jurisdiction of this Service  in April 2007. So I am not able
to deal with matters that happened before that date.  This decision, and hence our
consideration of Mrs Ps complaint  will only deal with events after 6 April 2007.
Given the time that has passed it hasnt been possible for JDW to confirm  the exact dates on
which Mrs P opened her catalogue shopping accounts. But it seems to me that it is probable
that both accounts  were  opened before 6 April 2007. If that is the case, I cannot deal with
what happened when  the accounts  were opened.
But JDW  has given us details of increases  that were applied  to Mrs Ps credit limits following 
that date. The regulations  require JDW  to conduct proportionate assessments of Mrs Ps 
ability to repay what she is being allowed to borrow under those credit limits. So it is those 
credit limit increases, after 6 April 2007,  that form the basis of the complaint I am considering 
here:

I understand that, around 2010, Mrs P faced problems repaying her accounts.  As a result
they were transferred to a third-party  debt collection company. Mrs P has told us that the
accounts have  now been repaid.
JDW has told us that it thinks  Mrs Ps complaint has been made too late. It considers that
she ought to have been aware that she had cause to complain more  than three years  before
she referred the matter  to the business.  I can see that Mrs P made her complaints to JDW  in
April and May 2018.
An ombudsman has already considered JDWs  arguments that the complaint was brought  
too late. He decided that Mrs Ps complaint was made within the applicable time limits and, 
therefore, that this service  can now look at the merits of the complaint.
So I can now decide whether or not it was reasonable for JDW to offer the credit limit 
increases to Mrs P.
One of our adjudicators has already considered the merits of the complaint and she 
recommended the complaint should  be upheld. She wasnt satisfied that JDWs checks  were 
good enough and considered Mrs Ps credit  limits should not have  been  increased from 
March 2008 onwards. She also found that Mrs Ps account should have been frozen in 
August 2008 and that she should  not have been  allowed any new purchases after 28th 
August 2008.
Our adjudicator said:
JDW should remove any interest  and charges incurred  as a result  of any credit  limit 
increases subsequent  to March 2008;
oSo it should only add interest accrued on the balance  up to the credit  limit in 
place before the March 2008  increases for both accounts;
Both accounts should have been  frozen on 28 August 2008 so JDW  should  remove 
all interest and charges added  to the accounts  since then, including  delivery fees, 
Buy Now Pay Later interest  accrued after that date and any insurance  premiums;
JDW should work  out how much  Mrs P owed after the above adjustments and any 
repayments shes made since March 2008  should reduce the adjusted balance;
If this clears the adjusted balance  any funds  remaining should be refunded to Mrs P 
with 8% simple interest - calculated from the date of overpayment to settlement date;
Ref: DRN32736623Or, if an outstanding balance remains, JDW should look to set up a suitable  payment 
plan with her for the outstanding amount. Although, Mrs P says both balances  have 
now been cleared;
JDW should remove any negative information  about the account from Mrs Ps credit 
file from March 2008 onwards once the amount  owed has been settled;
As the accounts  were passed to a third party, JDW may need to liaise  with them  to 
ensure the above  is carried out.
JDW responded to say, in summary, that Mrs P was regularly making  minimum repayments  
and there  was nothing to indicate there had been a change  in the way in which she was 
managing her accounts. It says that a creditworthiness check was carried  out at the point of 
each credit increase  and no adverse  information was apparent. JDW adds that it does not 
have the information available to understand the interest and charges applied from 2008.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mrs P and to JDW on 22 December 2020. I summarise my 
findings here:
Based on the relevant guidelines  at the time, as outlined in my provisional  decision, I wasnt 
satisfied that JDW  had completed appropriate and proportionate checks because:
Id seen no evidence  that JDW asked Mrs P about her income or expenditure;
Over  a period  of 19 months, Mrs Ps credit limit increased by £3,200;
Mrs Ps payment history  showed  she was only paying the minimum repayments and 
was sometimes late in paying;
JDW says it used credit checks and account management information to make  
decisions about increasing the credit  limits, but did not mention  that Mrs Ps income 
or expenditure was taken into account;
So I then considered what JDW was likely to have found had it carried out proportionate  
checks by looking at Mrs Ps bank statements from the time:
Mrs Ps bank  account was in significant credit for some  of 2007 from the proceeds of 
what appears to be a house sale.  So I didnt  think JDW  would have made a different 
decision about any credit limit increases that year had it carried  out better checks.
I couldnt see there was anything to indicate Mrs P was struggling to manage her 
money in December 2007 or January 2008, so I couldnt conclude  JDW  was wrong to 
increase her credit limit by £200 on 26 January  2008.
But I didnt think JDW should have  increased her limit by a further £550 on 13 March 
2008 because:
oA review of Mrs Ps regular income  and expenditure showed she had little 
disposable income each month;
Ref: DRN32736624Mrs Ps total monthly income was around  £2,600, off which  over 
£2,000 was already committed to regular payments and most of the 
remainder was spent  on food and travel;
oAround two-thirds of Mrs Ps income  was already being paid to credit 
providers;
oI thought it was likely that Mrs P was paying  at, or close  to, minimum 
payments on her four credit card accounts;
oMrs Ps bank  account was regularly  overdrawn  and having taken out a large 
loan in September 2007, she extended  this by several thousand  pounds  in 
January 2008.
oI considered there were clear indications that Mrs P was starting to struggle to 
manage her money and I thought  it was irresponsible to further extend her 
credit limits.
So I found it likely that if JDW  had carried out proportionate checks,  it would not have 
increased her credit  limit by £550  on 13 March 2008, or by a further £1,650  between  
then and August  2009.
By August 2008, proportionate  checks would also have  shown Mrs P was already 
making regular payments  to a debt management company and she hadnt made any 
real inroads to the payments she was making to her credit cards. At this point, I 
considered it would have been  reasonable to prevent any further  purchases  and 
thereby limit Mrs Ps overall debt.
In summary,  my provisional decision was that JDW should not have increased  Mrs Ps credit  
limits from March 2008 onwards, and that it should  have prevented further purchases from 
August 2008.
Ordinarily, JDW  should:
Refund any interest and charges incurred as a result of any credit limit increases 
from March 2008  onwards  and;
Refund all interest  and charges added to the accounts since 28 August 2008;
Add 8% simple interest - calculated  from the date of overpayment to the date of 
settlement;
Remove any negative information  about  the account from Mrs Ps credit  file from 
March 2008 onwards;
But I accepted  that JDW said it does not have complete records from 2008 to when the 
accounts were fully repaid. So, I said that JDW should use what  information it does have, 
make a reasonable estimate of the refund due and explain  its calculations  to Mrs P, along 
with its assumptions.
Mrs P responded to say she had no further information to add.
JDW did not respond to my provisional  decision.
Ref: DRN32736625my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mrs P, nor JDW, offered any further  information, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that J D Williams & Company Limited should provide  the refund as outlined 
above, based on its best estimation, and remove any negative information from Mrs Ps 
credit file from March 2008  onwards.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 March 2021.
