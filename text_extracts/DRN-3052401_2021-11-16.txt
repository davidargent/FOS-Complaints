The complaint
Ms Y complained National Westminster Bank Plc processed a loan application in her name 
and completed a credit search when she was only using their online loan calculator. 
What happened
Ms Y has been a NatWest customer for several years. In early July 2020, she used 
NatWests website to obtain a quote for a loan. 
Ms Y said she accessed the NatWest loan calculator but saw various error messages 
displayed. She eventually progressed with, what she believed was, the calculators quick 
quote. After completing several details, Ms Y said that the website crashed. Shortly after, 
she received a message to say that her loan application had been denied. 
Ms Y didnt understand why shed received this message. She said she hadnt completed an 
application or declaration. She continued to try to access the website without success.
Ms Y rang NatWest on 6 July 2020. She said they confirmed thered been issues with their 
website. She said they also told her the application wouldve been declined because her 
mortgage details hadnt been included. Nat West agreed to raise a complaint requesting the 
credit search be removed from her credit file.
NatWest then wrote to Ms Y. They said there hadnt been any problems with their website. 
They also said that Ms Y had completed and submitted a loan application. NatWest 
acknowledged Ms Y said she thought she was only getting a quote. But their systems 
showed shed actually completed an application. They said they hadnt made an error, so 
wouldnt be able to remove the search from her credit file.
Ms Y wasnt happy with NatWests response. She insisted shed only requested a quote. 
She also said, as a result, shed had to take a more expensive loan with another provider. 
She thought the higher rate was due to NatWests search. So, she referred her complaint to 
this service. Ms Y wanted NatWest to remove the search and compensate her for the 
additional fees incurred for the loan she secured. 
One of our investigators looked into Ms Ys complaint. She didnt think NatWest had done 
anything wrong or needed to take any action here. Ms Y didnt agree with our investigator. 
So, she asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It appears Ms Ys problems arose when she experienced problems trying to use NatWests 
website. Shes explained those problems to our investigator. Ms Y says she spoke to 
NatWest and they acknowledged these issues. So, our investigator asked Ms Y to provide 
specific details of the call she made to NatWest so that we could request a recording.
Ms Y was unable to provide all the required information. So, NatWest have been unable to 
locate a recording or any notes relating to the call referred to. While this is unfortunate, 
NatWest are not obliged to record or retain call recordings indefinitely. NatWest have also 
checked their records for evidence of any system faults during the period referred to. 
Theyve not been able to find any evidence of system problems at the time Ms Y made the 
loan application.
NatWest have provided this service with information from their systems relating to the loan 
application they say Ms Y made. Theyve also provided templates of the screen flows that 
would have to be followed to enable an application to be submitted. This includes a 
declaration authorising NatWest to use the personal information and make any necessary 
checks with credit reference agencies. NatWest have confirmed it isnt possible for a loan 
application to be completed or processed without this declaration box being ticked.
The information appears to show an application was made by Ms Y on the date suggested. It 
also shows that her application was declined. Ms Y believes the loan was declined because 
she hadnt fully completed the required information  in particular details of her mortgage. 
Applications are usually assessed using a wide variety of information and sources. While I 
agree her mortgage details hadnt been completed, I cant reasonably conclude this was the 
main reason for the application being declined.
I do understand Ms Ys frustration here. She clearly believes she didnt complete and submit 
a loan application in full as she was only looking for a quote  I dont doubt that was her 
intention. Unfortunately, based upon the information Ive seen, Im persuaded that an 
application was completed by Ms Y, and that NatWest assessed and ultimately declined it. 
I also agree with our investigator here. While a recording of Ms Ys call to NatWest hasnt 
been found, I cant reasonably say this wouldve resulted in me reaching a different 
conclusion. If there had been system problems, I wouldnt have expected to see a loan 
application successfully submitted. Particularly if Ms Y had, as shes suggested, only 
accessed NatWests loan calculator.
While I appreciate that Ms Y will be disappointed, I havent seen anything which leads me to 
conclude that NatWest have done anything wrong here. Their records appear complete and 
the credit search appears to have been undertaken appropriately. So, I cant reasonably ask 
them to remove this from Ms Ys credit file.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Ms Ys complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
