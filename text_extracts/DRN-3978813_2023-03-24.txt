The complaint
Mr P complains that Options UK Personal Pensions LLP (Options) shouldnt have accepted 
his application to transfer his Armed Forces Pension into a self-invested personal pension 
(SIPP) and invest the funds in a Friends Provident International (FPI) Reserve bond. He 
wants Options to put him back in the position he wouldve been in had Options not accepted 
his SIPP application.
At the time of the relevant events Options was trading as Carey Pensions UK LLP. But 
throughout this decision I will refer to the business as Options.
Background
Ive set out below the parties involved in Mr Ps pension transfer and investment.
Options
Options is a SIPP provider and administrator. At the time of the events in this complaint, 
Options was regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which later became the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Options was authorised, in relation to SIPPs, to arrange 
(bring about) deals in investments, to deal in investments as principal, to establish, operate 
or wind up a pension scheme, and to make arrangements with a view to transactions in 
investments.
Caledonian
Caledonian was a trading name of a business called MMG Associates, which was registered 
in the British Virgin Islands. Caledonian was not authorised in the UK to carry on regulated 
activities and it does not (and did not at the time of the events subject to complaint here) 
appear on the FCAs Financial Services Register. And there is no evidence it was authorised 
to carry out regulated activities (where there was any relevant legislation) in any other 
jurisdiction.
Friends Provident International
Friends Provident International (FPI) is registered in the Isle of Man. It provided a bond (i.e. 
life assurance) wrapper which allows investment in a number of funds with a number of fund 
providers. Mr P invested in a number of investments within a FPI bond.
Business C
Business C is an investment manager. The evidence is that Business C agreed to manage 
or provide oversight of some of the investments taken out by Caledonians customers after 
they had transferred their pensions.
What happened
Mr P had a defined benefit occupational pension from his time working in the Armed Forces. 
He said he was approached by an unregulated adviser from a firm called Caledonian 
International Ltd. He told us that when he was working abroad the adviser regularly visited 
his workplace and had approached some of his work colleagues. He said that during a 
meeting he gave the adviser details of his existing Armed Forces Pension and the adviser 
showed him a comparison demonstrating that an Options Pension would perform better than 
his Armed Forces Pension. Mr P said the adviser told him that:
with the Carey SIPP the returns on the investment would be better and I would be 
able to access it a lot sooner than my existing pension.
And:
with the SIPP I would have more control over my pension rather than the military 
controlling it.
And:
He said I could either choose the companies to invest in or let him decide where to 
invest my funds.
Mr P said he wasnt told about the guaranteed benefits hed lose by transferring out of his 
existing pension, or that he would be investing in any non-standard, high-risk investments, or 
that the investments could potentially fail and/or become illiquid.
Mr P described himself as a medium risk investor with no previous investment experience. 
He said his Army pension was his only provision for retirement and so he had no capacity 
for loss. He said he had no cash savings, an outstanding mortgage, and another financial 
commitment.
He said:
Although I did have concerns about transferring my existing pension into this SIPP, 
the advisor assured me I would receive significant returns [and] as the professional I 
trusted his recommendation.
Under a cover letter dated 23 July 2012 Caledonian sent Options a SIPP application form 
with supporting documents on Mr Ps behalf. Caledonian included a list of documents 
attached. Amongst those listed as attached were LOA for Caledonian and Advice. The 
only document listed as not attached was a transfer analysis.
The documents included The Carey Pension Scheme Application Form for Direct Clients. 
The application form said, SIPP to be established on execution only and:
you are a client establishing a SIPP without advice. You have made this decision 
independently and are aware of the implications of this decision.
Information entered on the form indicated Mr Ps permanent home address was in the UK 
and he worked for a UK-based employer. It said he wanted to transfer funds from an Armed 
Forces Pension and the transfer value of his pension entitlements in the Armed Forces 
scheme was nearly £66,000. And it said Mr P wanted to invest all of his transferred funds 
and any future funds in FPI and that his investment authorisation was execution only 
Investment manager trades on your instructions only.
The application form said:As you do not have a Financial Adviser, your investment choices are your sole 
responsibility. You will instruct us and we will act on those instructions as long as it is 
an accepted investment in the Carey Pension Scheme.
Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension Trustees UK Ltd will not at any time 
review any aspects of your appointed investment Manager's financial status or 
investment and risk strategies nor have any involvement in your investment choices 
and selection, nor give advice on the suitability of your investment choices. We would 
always recommend independent advice be obtained from a suitably qualified adviser. 
If, at any time your position changes and you appoint a Financial Adviser, you must 
inform us. You are responsible for the ongoing review and monitoring of the 
investments you have chosen - and remember - all investments can go down in value 
as well as up. Carey Pensions is not responsible for any investment choices or 
decisions.
The application form also said:
If you are applying for the Restricted Investment SIPP you are limited to 2 'standard 
investments', see Key Features document. The RI-SIPP does not allow any 
Alternative Investments.
Mr P ticked a box saying he waived his right to cancel his SIPP within 30 days of it being 
established. 
The documents attached to Mr Ps application form also included a member declaration 
signed by Mr P and dated 8 May 2012. Amongst other things, the declaration said:
I confirm that I have received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian 
International and following this advice I wish to proceed with the transfer. I am fully 
aware and understand that by giving an instruction to proceed with the transfer of my 
Occupational Scheme Benefits to the Carey Pension Scheme I may lose substantial 
benefits. However, being of sound mind and in full possession of the facts I have 
considered the matter of the transfer and as an individual confirm my decision and 
instruction to both Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension Trustees UK Ltd to 
proceed with the transfer of the Occupational Scheme Benefits. I am fully aware that 
in acting on my instructions both Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension 
Trustees UK Ltd act on an Execution Only Basis. Neither Carey Pensions UK LLP 
nor Carey Pension Trustees UK Ltd have provided any advice whatsoever in respect 
of this transaction.
The declaration listed Mr C of Caledonian as Adviser. And Mr C of Caledonian signed the 
declaration in the field designated for the Adviser.
A letter signed by Mr P and giving his home address in the UK and dated 8 May 2012 
confirmed that he wanted to transfer his deferred benefits in the Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme to an Options SIPP and that Options was not responsible for his decision and 
provided an execution-only service.
A further letter signed by Mr P giving his UK address and dated 8 May 2012 gave consent 
for Options to provide to Caledonian any information they may so request in relation to my 
Scheme and my Scheme's purchase of investments.
An urgent memorandum dated 8 May 2012 from Mr P to the Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme said:I wish to transfer my Armed Forces Pension and request that all discontinuance and 
discharge papers be sent directly to the administrators of my alternative pension 
scheme, for the attention of  Carey 
On 24 July 2012 Options wrote to Mr P thanking him for applying for a Restricted Investment 
SIPP and saying his SIPP was established that day. 
Options said it also, on the same day, sent Mr P a welcome pack which included the SIPP 
terms and conditions and SIPP key features document.
On 6 September 2012 the Armed Forces Pension Scheme wrote to Options, saying:
Thank you for your letter of 17-Aug-2012 in which you agreed to accept a transfer in 
favour of Mr P You will receive, within the next 21 working days, a BACS payment 
for [nearly £66,000].

Please note that once the payment has been made, the transfer is completed
On 20 September 2012 Mr Ps pension funds were transferred to Options.
On 16 October 2012 Options invested nearly £64,000 in FPI for Mr P.
On 22 October 2012 FPI wrote to Options providing a policy schedule. It said a copy had 
been sent to your adviser.
Also, on 22 October 2012 FPI wrote to Options saying it had paid commission of 7% to 
Caledonian for introducing the policy to us. It said, If you have any queries, please contact 
your Financial Adviser or contact us
In a statement of account for Mr Ps SIPP, Options recorded a payment of £750 to 
Caledonian dated 21 November 2012 and described it as IFA fees.
Mr Ps complaint
In November 2018 Mr P complained to Options about Options accepting his application 
through Caledonian.
Via his representative Mr P said Caledonian had advised him to make the transfer and 
investment. He said he wasnt told of the level of risk that the investments carried and didnt 
understand that Caledonian wasnt regulated by the FCA or what the importance of such 
regulation was. He said he had some doubts, but Caledonian appeared knowledgeable and 
professed to have expertise in pensions and investments, and Mr P trusted Caledonians 
advice. Mr P understood very clearly that he was being advised by Caledonian International 
Ltd about the decision to transfer his pension and make investment choices in a SIPP and 
that Caledonian was helping him arrange that transfer and investment. Given his complete 
lack of investment experience, Mr P said, he felt entirely unequipped to make decisions of 
this nature without advice and assistance.
Mr P said Options had failed to fulfil its obligations by accepting his business when it was 
aware he hadnt received regulated advice on the transfer or the investment, but rather had 
been introduced by an unregulated firm which had recommended the transfer and 
investment to him. He said it ought to have been obvious to Options from the circumstances 
that he was following the advice of Caledonian and that he was being assisted by them in arranging the pension transfer and investment. He said Options shouldve refused to 
facilitate the transfer and investment.
Mr P said the transfer and investment were unsuitable for him and hed suffered significant 
losses. He said he wouldnt have made the transfer or the investment if Options hadnt 
accepted his application. He wanted to be put back in the position he wouldve been in had 
he retained his pension provision with the Armed Forces Pension scheme.
Options responded in December 2018, rejecting Mr Ps complaint. In summary it said the 
following:
Mr P was classed as a direct client of Options because Caledonian was not a 
regulated advice firm and acted only as Mr Ps introducer.
Options provided an execution-only service and made that clear to Mr P who signed 
acknowledgement of that; it wasnt the role of Options and nor was Options qualified 
or permitted to advise on the suitability of the SIPP for Mr P, or the underlying 
investment or the customers chosen introducer.
COBS 11.2.19 says a firm must follow a clients specific instruction and thats what 
Options did in Mr Ps case  by virtue of this rule Options was not liable to Mr P.
Mr P didnt tell Options he was advised by an unregulated company  Options cant 
be held responsible for information that wasnt disclosed to it.
By signing the documents Mr P confirmed he understood the risks associated with 
his choices and that Options wasnt responsible for any of those decisions.
Options was permitted to receive introductions from non-regulated introducers, and 
the fact Caledonian was an unregulated introducer was made clear to Mr P.
Options wouldnt comment on Mr Ps interactions with his chosen introducer because 
Options wasnt party to those interactions. And Options had no control over 
information Caledonian gave Mr P. Options relationship was with Mr P only and all 
correspondence regarding his decisions and instructions came directly from him.
Options did due diligence on Caledonian and when it accepted Mr Ps application its 
checks gave it no reason to think it shouldnt accept business from Caledonian.
A breach of the FCAs Principles for Business didnt give Mr P any actionable rights. 
And, in any case, Options complied with the Principles.
The regulators guidance wasnt a rulebook  it wasnt exhaustive or prescriptive. And 
in any case Options acted in accordance with the conduct described as appropriate 
in the guidance.
Mr P hadnt shown that an adviser arranged his SIPP; the actions of an adviser didnt 
amount to arranging as per Article 25 of the Regulated Activities Order. If a court 
found that an adviser advised Mr P or arranged his investment in breach of the 
general prohibition against carrying on regulated activities without permission, the 
court would exercise its discretion under section 28 of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to allow Options to enforce its agreement with Mr P.
Clients of Options had the right to make decisions without advice.Caledonian wasnt an adviser. And, if it held itself out to be an adviser, Options 
wasnt aware of that. Options treated Caledonian as an unregulated introducer and 
followed its own strict processes for dealing with unregulated introducers and 
accepting introductions.
Mr P signed documentation which made clear that he was a direct client who hadnt 
received any advice and that his investment choices were his sole responsibility. The 
documentation guided him to seek financial advice, but he chose not to do so.
If Mr P believed hed received advice, he didnt say that the application form he 
completed was the wrong one for him.
Mr P signed a declaration showing he knew he wasnt receiving financial advice, and 
that Options was acting on an execution-only basis.
It was reasonable for Options to accept at face value Mr Ps signature confirming he 
understood the documents. If he didnt agree to or understand them, he shouldnt 
have signed them.
As SIPP administrator Options isnt responsible for assessing the suitability of an 
investment for an individuals personal situation. Overall Options had complied with 
its regulatory and contractual obligations to Mr P and wasnt liable for his loss.
Mr P referred his complaint to us in April 2019. He said he was affected as follows:
I originally transferred my Army Pension valued at [nearly £66,000] in 2012. My 
latest valuation from Carey Pension's dated 31/03/18 showed an investment value of 
[about £10,000] and a minuscule amount in cash. I have suffered catastrophic losses 
in comparison to the position I would have been had Carey Pension's refused to 
facilitate the transaction .
The relationship between Options and Caledonian
Ive set out the background to Mr Ps complaint and his dealings with Caledonian and 
Options above. But alongside those events its important to understand the underlying 
relationship between Caledonian and Options.
Options has said it carried out due diligence checks on Caledonian, and its provided 
evidence of the checks it made.
The relationship between Options and Caledonian began in early 2012. Options said that 
between 27 April 2012 and 20 May 2013 Caledonian made 509 introductions to Options. 
Ive set out below a summary of what I consider to be the key events and/or actions during 
the relationship between Options and Caledonian, which Ive observed from the available 
evidence (including evidence from Mr Ps case file and submissions Options has made to us 
about its due diligence on, and its relationship with, Caledonian).
A business profile was completed which recorded the first meeting between Options and 
Mr C of Caledonian in March 2012. It set out Caledonians proposed business model. It said 
Mr C was preferred adviser for the Armed Forces occupational pension scheme. It said the 
profile of Caledonian clients was:
30 to 50 year oldsHad been in the armed forces for between 6 to 10 years
Had left the armed forces and wanted to transfer their pension arrangements
They had no expectation of long life expectancy
They were living today so wanted to access funds earlier then they could if their 
pension stayed in the armed forces pension scheme
They were generally still resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various 
countries such as Thailand, Germany, Spain etc.
They were now earning quite large salaries circa £70k plus
The business profile said clients were referred to Mr C from his Armed Forces pensions 
contact or by other clients, and he was currently putting them into an international Friends 
Provident Bond, the underlying investments were regulated. It said:
[Mr C] himself was not a regulated adviser, he was a consultant to these clients and 
advised them on their armed forces transfers only, he was a qualified accountant and 
was a member of the Chartered Institute of Accountants.
His company was trading as Caledonian although the holding company was a BVI 
company called MMG Associates 
[Mr C] was looking at volume business in the region of 50 schemes a month.
On 16 March 2012 Mr C signed and dated the Options Non-Regulated Introducer Profile. 
The form described its purpose as follows:
As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out.
Under Company Information it was entered that Caledonian had branches in Chile, Peru, 
Columbia, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland and had been trading since 1997.
Under Product Information, it was entered that Caledonian dealt with Offshore savings 
plans + investment bonds  Friends Provident International + Generali and that these 
products had been accepted by Options and other SIPP providers, and hadnt been declined 
by any pension scheme operators. 
Under Sales and Marketing Approach, it was entered that Caledonian would obtain clients 
by Referral and the sales process would be: Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit.
A question about the typical commission structure was answered: 7% up front from bond  
0.5% Trail.
Under Training and Information, in response to the question, What training is provided to 
the agents within the Firm? the answer was: Ongoing product training and accompanied 
meetings. And that training was delivered through: Visits to providers directly. In response 
to how the business produced by its agents was monitored, the answer was: Full 
administrative structure  Caledonian, Careys  Compliance. FPI  Compliance.
In response to a question about the kind of service it sought from a SIPP provider, the 
answer was: Administration + Compliance.Under the section headed Legal and Regulatory Information, it was recorded that 
Caledonian didnt work with any FSA regulated company or adviser, wasnt a member of any 
professional or trade body, had no professional indemnity cover in place, and hadnt recently 
been and wasnt currently subject to any FSA supervisory visits, reviews or other regulatory 
action or censure.
In response to the question What measures are in place to ensure the Firm engage legal 
advice on the activities it carries out to ensure regulated activities are not carried out? the 
answer was: Majority of business carried out in unregulated jurisdictions but where 
regulations apply we are licensed to carry out our activities.
In response to how Caledonian demonstrates it treats its customers fairly, it was said: 
Compliance & Procedures in current alignment with FSA TCF.
Information entered said Caledonians objectives for the coming 12 months were: To 
continue to develop a fully compliant business of PT to HM Forces. And with regards to 
member-directed pension scheme business, Caledonian was looking to achieve a 
Compliant business in a Regulated structure.
On 23 March 2012 Options asked Mr C for a copy of Caledonians latest company accounts 
and a certified copy of each directors/principals passport. Options chased a response to 
this on 3 April 2012. A senior consultant at Caledonian replied on the same day and 
provided a copy of Mr Cs passport (uncertified). About the company accounts she said 
shed speak to Mr C when he returned from a trip. On 4 April 2012 Mr C emailed Options:
my apologies for not having replied before now  I am back tomorrow Thursday 
and will have te [sic] appropriate documents over to you early next week 
On 27 April 2012 Options started to receive introductions from Caledonian. On 1 August 
2012, ahead of a compliance audit, a Team Leader at Options asked Caledonian again for 
the certified passports and annual accounts. In an internal email the Team Leader said shed 
spoken to Mr C and hed be sending an urgent request for the documentation we require.
On 4 September 2012 Mr C and the CEO of Options signed and dated a Non-regulated 
Introducer Agreement Terms of Business document between Options and MMG Associates 
Ltd T/A Caledonian International Associates. Amongst other terms the agreement included 
the following undertaking:
The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
[the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000] in relation to the SIPP  for the 
avoidance of doubt this includes reference to advice on the selection of The SIPP 
Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, taking benefits and HMRC rules
Options has said Caledonian received the terms of business on 21 March 2012  and so it 
seems there was a delay in Mr C signing and returning the document.
On 1 November 2012 Options did a background check using World Check (a risk 
intelligence tool which allows subscribers to conduct background checks on businesses and 
individuals) on two Caledonian employees, one of whom was Mr C. The check didnt reveal 
any issues.
Options has said that in early 2013, it appointed a dedicated in-house compliance officer 
and they enhanced the compliance framework within the firm, compliance monitoring 
programme and risk assessment.On 7 March 2013 a manager at Options sent an internal email to other Options employees, 
including its CEO, summarising a call Options had held with Mr C. In summary, it said:
Options had noted that, following recent FSA reviews and guidance, SIPP operators 
were being asked to look at the business received from their introducers against their 
expectations of type and profile.
Options had noted that several applications it received recently had moved away 
from the expected profile. And Options asked whether the profile was changing.
Mr C had said that predominantly the members were in the close protection industry 
which as@ 5 years ago they all went into. He said that foreign operatives were now 
coming in in a more organised structure. Some were getting promoted into senior 
positions. Many were previously divers in the military and so going into Diving 
elsewhere.
Options had asked Mr C to put together a note to update Caledonians business 
profile and expectations.
On 20 March 2013 the Options manager followed up the conversation with Mr C by email. 
Options asked again for an update as to the changes in profile, and noted it had received a 
further two applications for individuals outside the expected profile.
Options has also provided an undated document called the Overseas Introducer 
Assessment Proforma. The document listed a number of criteria and labelled its 
assessment as low risk, medium risk or high risk with supporting notes on each. This 
document isnt dated but I think its likely to have been completed in March 2013 as it refers 
to Options recently having seen consumers introduced which fell outside the expected 
profile, which seems to refer to the 7 March 2013 email.  Ive set out below what I consider 
the most relevant sections of this document and the level of risk that was noted.

On 26 April 2013 an Options Compliance Officer emailed several other Options employees, 
with the title Review of relationship with Caledonian. She said:
We have a responsibility to proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure 
our products do not end up with customers for whom it is not suitable. Based on 
recent correspondence with Caledonian I am increasingly concerned by their 
business practices and therefore believe we should review our relationship with them 
and the business they have introduced. I will arrange a meeting for next week to 
discuss. In the meantime we need to determine the answers to the questions below 
to help facilitate our discussions.
The Compliance Officer set out 18 questions and statements about Caledonian and its 
relationship with Options and invited the other employees who received her email to please 
provide answers to the following where you can.

A further reply was made later on 30 April 2013 by the CEO of Options. The CEO wrote:
To add to [Options employee]s information. I attach a business profile which details 
how the relationship emerged with Caledonian which provides background 
information, also the process notes that were agreed at a meeting held in our old MK 
office which was a workshop to present our SIPP proposition and understand their 
business better  In answer to some of [Options employee]s unknowns. 
Where do they meet with clients? Generally abroad depending on where their next 
assignment is, they will also hold meetings in the UK

meeting with them twice and by running a workshop for them output from which is

Based on our contact with Caledonian and reviewing the illustrations they provide to 
clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? I 
am not sure it is our place to comment on this maybe on the information but not on 
advice, if we commented on whether we thought even our regulated advisers were 
providing poor advice I would probably think we would say yes. Think we need to be 
careful what questions we are looking to answer comfortable on the information piece 
but not on the advice piece
Do Caledonian provide advice on investments within the SIPP? No they don't, they 
consult with the client on the feasibility of transferring their Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme into a SIPP and their partner to manage the investment is [Business C]
On 10 May 2013 the Options CEO emailed Caledonian requesting further information. The 
email said Options was reviewing its terms of business in light of recent announcements 
from the FCA and our internal compliance reviews. Options said it was keen to continue to 
do business with Caledonian but that it must do so: in a framework that is robust and 
compliant and will satisfy the regulators, Options said, so we must start with ensuring we 
understand each stage of the process, to enable us to develop a robust and compliant 
process for this business moving forward. Options asked Caledonian the following 
questions:
1. Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions.
2.Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.3.What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
4.On what basis are you providing illustrations and the reasons for this basis
5.Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in Jordan
6.Please confirm the profile of your clients
7.Please confirm how you receive introductions to your clients
8.Can you update information about your team their background, expertise in dealing 
with pensions
9.On the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a permanent 
place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to be sent to The 
Pensions Service Centre, [UK city]. Please can you clarify Caledonian's presence in 
the UK and the nature of the office in [UK city].
Options said that from 1 May 2013 it had implemented changes to its requirements, and that 
Caledonian had to have a UK FCA regulated adviser providing the TVAS and the sign off for 
the suitability of transfers from occupational schemes of any values.
On 15 May 2013 Options sent an internal email which was a summary of a telephone 
conversation with Business C. The summary recorded that Business C confirmed an FCA 
Regulated Adviser would provide TVAS reports on all Caledonian-introduced clients and on 
the back book of business with Caledonian. And that on this understanding Options had 
agreed it would continue to process applications where the TVAS report was currently being 
issued by Business C.
Options says the last introduction made to it by Caledonian was on 20 May 2013.
On 23 May 2013 Options met with Caledonian and Business C. A summary of the meeting 
said:
Mr C said he was a consultant to the Armed Forces and not an adviser in the FCA 
sense.
Caledonians UK office was a postal address only and not a working office.
Mr C met with clients in the UK but initial contact was abroad. It was noted that 
documents completed by Caledonian had said he met them in Jordan. And FPI 
needed a letter about where advice was given.
Caledonians website didnt mention that it would give advice. And its documents said 
no advice was given and clients should take advice from a regulated adviser.
Caledonian said the reason for lots of transfers was because of the market and its 
relationship with providers.
The proposal going forward involved an appointed representative of a UK-based IFA 
being the pension specialist of Business C and the UK-based IFA dealing with 
business moving forward.Options agreed to allow Caledonian a four-week window to put the changes in place.
The question about Caledonian providing a letter stating where advice was being 
given was irrelevant to Options as Caledonian didnt provide advice.
Caledonian said its illustrations were provided for clients to facilitate the business. 
Options queried whether this was advice.
I havent seen evidence that any of these actions were completed. As noted, Options didnt 
accept business from Caledonian after 20 May 2013.
Options has provided a copy of a document headed, Caledonian Relationship Review 
2013. Ive reviewed the document in full, but have only quoted below what I consider to be 
the key part:
Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were 
raised regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through 
an unregulated entity. 
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case.
We have insisted that they move to a model that all cases are fully advised by an 
FCA regulated firm/individual, which has been accepted.

Following a meeting in the Milton Keynes office with ourselves [Options staff at the 
meeting] where [Mr C], and [Business C] explained their current process and 
documentation and described their future process, further discussions between 
[initials of various staff members at the businesses] it was decided that they had not 
satisfied us enough with their current processes for us to continue to allow taking on 
new business in the interim without the use of a UK regulated firm or individual who 
was suitably qualified.
[Options Chief Executive] has instructed the team of this decision so from week 
beginning 28th May any new business received will be rejected unless it comes 
through an FCA regulated firm 
It set out a detailed process, by which Caledonian proposed to move to a model where all 
clients would be fully advised by an FCA regulated firm/individual, and it highlighted the 
benefits of this new approach as being:
all schemes are coming in on an advised basis; it brings the process and client into 
the UK regulated process; it brings the clients into the FSCS and FOS protections; 
and ensures all occupational schemes undergo analysis and advice
I havent seen evidence that this approach was enacted  again, as noted, Options accepted 
no business introduced by Caledonian after 20 May 2013.
Our Investigators view
Our Investigator who looked into Mr Ps complaint took the view that the complaint should be 
upheld because Options ought not to have accepted Mr Ps application from Caledonian.The Investigator said Options had been obligated to do due diligence on Caledonian, as an 
introducer. And that had Options done sufficient due diligence, or drawn reasonable 
conclusions from the information it had about Caledonian, it ought to have concluded that 
Caledonians business model might lead to consumer detriment. In relation to the 
investment, the Investigator said the investment itself might reasonably not have given 
Options cause for concern.
The Investigator set out that Options should put things right by comparing Mr Ps current 
position to the position he wouldve been in had he not transferred from his defined benefit 
pension scheme. And Options should pay him compensation. The Investigator also 
recommended Options pay Mr P £500 for distress and inconvenience caused by its failings.
Mr P accepted the Investigators view.
Options didnt agree with the Investigators view. Ive summarised below what I consider to 
be the key points of the response from Options, but Ive considered the response in its 
entirety.
The Investigators view didnt reflect the regulatory and legal regime in which Options 
acted at the relevant time. The duties the Investigator said Options owed Mr P 
wouldnt be recognised by a Court, and legal liability wouldnt exist in this case.
Options operated on an execution-only basis. It didnt and wasnt permitted to provide 
advice or otherwise comment on the suitability of investments.
Regulatory guidance published after the events that were the subject of Mr Ps 
complaint wasnt relevant; it introduced new expectations which didnt apply at the 
relevant time.
Options operated at all times on the basis that Caledonian wasnt advising members. 
Options made the prohibition on advice clear to Caledonian. Options didnt at any 
point become aware that Caledonian was providing advice. And theres no evidence 
Caledonian advised Mr P.
The Investigators view hadnt taken into account the relevant law and application of 
the RAO as considered by the Court of Appeal in Adams v Options UK Personal 
Pensions LLP [2021] EWCA Civ 474 (the Adams Appeal judgement).
The Investigators view hadnt identified what the law required and on what basis (if 
any) Options was legally liable for Mr Ps loss.
The duties as described in the Investigators view held Options to a standard which 
was unclear, more demanding than is fair or reasonable, and inconsistent with the 
contract Mr P entered into and the general scheme of the COBS rules at the time 
(which imposed no duty on Options to assess introducers or investments). The judge 
in Adams rejected the proposition that Options owed duties of the kinds now being 
relied upon by reference to any legally actionable COBS rules.
There was no requirement at the time for a consumer to be advised before 
transferring a defined benefit pension.
SIPP providers werent prohibited from dealing with unregulated introducers. And it 
was shown in Adams that, at the material time, the FSA regarded as acceptable the 
approach by Options to accepting business from unregulated introducers.It was wrong to say Options had sole liability for investment decisions that Mr P made 
without any advice from Options.
The decision by Options to stop accepting business without regulated advice being 
provided was a broader policy decision that Options made in February 2014. It wasnt 
a decision made in response to what Options knew of Caledonians practices. And 
the decision by Options in August 2014 to stop accepting non-regulated introducer 
business wasnt about Caledonian specifically.
SIPP providers should be able to rely on express representations by consumers in 
signed contractual documentation such as the indemnity signed by Mr P which said: 
I understand that Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension Trustees UK Ltd are 
not in anyway [sic] able to provide me with any advice  I confirm that I am 
establishing the Carey Pension Scheme on an Execution only basis.
Had Options told Mr P it wouldnt accept business from Caledonian, on balance Mr P 
wouldve gone ahead with the transfer and the FPI investment. Even if another 
provider mightve reached the conclusions the Investigator said Options shouldve 
reached, Mr P was determined to proceed, and another SIPP provider could properly 
have accepted the investment.
The Investigator didnt say what information Options wouldve obtained through 
better due diligence which wouldve led it to discover Mr P was advised. For 
example, the Investigator said Caledonian failed to give Options its accounts, but the 
Investigator didnt say what the accounts wouldve led Options to discover and how 
that wouldve led Options to refuse Mr Ps application.
Once Mr Ps request to transfer was made, Options was obliged to complete the 
transfer. So, the loss of DB benefits was assured from that point. Even if Options had 
asked Mr P if he wanted to proceed with the investment, Mr P had lost his 
guaranteed benefits from the moment he made the transfer request. So Mr P must 
bear the loss of these benefits.
Mr Ps alleged loss was in the realms of the possible performance of an investment.
Mere underperformance of an investment doesnt create a wrong or liability.
Any calculation of loss must have regard to the fact the investment was no cause for 
concern and mustnt rely on how the investment had performed in hindsight.
If Mr P had to be put back in the position he wouldve been in had he not transferred 
his pension then Options agreed with the basis for calculating compensation set out 
by the Investigator, except on the following points:
oIf the investments remained with Mr P because they couldnt be returned to 
Options, compensation should be adjusted to reflect this (just as in Adams a 
presumptive value was ascribed to the investment).
oOptions hadnt seen any evidence that Mr P should be paid £500 for trouble 
and upset and Options should have a fair and reasonable opportunity to 
respond to any such evidence.
Options also requested an oral hearing which it said was necessary to explore the following 
points in particular: The extent of Caledonians role in Mr Ps decision to establish the SIPP, transfer his 
pension, and make the investment
Mr Ps understanding of his investment and the roles of the parties
Mr Ps motivation for entering the transaction and transferring from a defined benefit 
pension scheme (including the enhanced death benefits)
Because no agreement could be reached on Mr Ps complaint, it was passed to me to review 
afresh and make a decision.
My provisional decision
In advance of this final decision, I issued a provisional decision in which I said that I thought 
Mr Ps complaint should be upheld.
I also explained why I am satisfied its not necessary for me to hold an oral hearing. My 
conclusion about that remains unchanged so I shant repeat it here.
Options did not respond to the provisional decision. Mr P responded to say he accepted the 
provisional decision.
As I havent received any further submissions from either party and havent been persuaded 
to depart from my provisional findings, Ive repeated my provisional findings below  and 
have not therefore included any further detail of them in this background summary.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint, Ive 
taken into account: relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry 
practice at the relevant time.
As I havent received any further submissions from either party, I dont think I need to 
change my provisional findings. So, I have repeated them below and adopt them as my 
findings in this final decision.
In my provisional decision I said:
The purpose of this decision is to set out my findings on whats fair and reasonable, and 
explain my reasons for reaching those findings, not to offer a point by point response to 
every submission made by the parties to the complaint. And so, while I have considered all 
the submissions by both parties, Ive focussed here on the points I believe to be key to my 
decision on whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Im minded to reach the same conclusion as our Investigator did. And for broadly the same 
reasons I intend to uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill explain why. 
Relevant considerations
The PrinciplesIn my view the FCAs Principles for Businesses are of particular relevance to my decision. 
The Principles for Businesses, which are set out in the FCAs handbook are a general 
statement of the fundamental obligations of firms under the regulatory system (PRIN 
1.1.2G). I consider that the Principles relevant to this complaint include Principles 2, 3 and 6 
which say the following:
Principle 2  Skill, care and diligence  A firm must conduct its business with due 
skill, care and diligence
Principle 3  Management and control  A firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk 
management systems
Principle 6  Customers interests  A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its 
customers and treat them fairly.
Ive carefully considered the relevant law and what it says about the application of the 
Principles. In R (British Bankers Association) v Financial Services Authority [2011] EWHC 
999 (Admin) (BBA) Ouseley J said at paragraph 162:
The Principles are best understood as the ever present substrata to which the 
specific rules are added. The Principles always have to be complied with. The 
specific rules do not supplant them and cannot be used to contradict them. They are 
but specific applications of them to the particular requirement they cover. The general 
notion that the specific rules can exhaust the application of the Principles is 
inappropriate. It cannot be an error of law for the Principles to augment specific 
rules.
And at paragraph 77 of BBA Ouseley J said:
Indeed, it is my view that it would be a breach of statutory duty for the Ombudsman 
to reach a view on a case without taking the Principles into account in deciding what 
would be fair and reasonable and what redress to afford. Even if no Principles had 
been produced by the FSA, the FOS would find it hard to fulfil its particular statutory 
duty without having regard to the sort of high level principles which find expression in 
the Principles, whoever formulated them. They are of the essence of what is fair and 
reasonable, subject to the argument about their relationship to specific rules.
In (R (Berkeley Burke SIPP Administration Ltd) v Financial Ombudsman Service [2018] 
EWHC 2878) (BBSAL), Berkeley Burke brought a judicial review claim challenging the 
decision of an ombudsman who had upheld a consumers complaint against it. The 
ombudsman considered the FCA Principles and good industry practice at the relevant time. 
He concluded that it was fair and reasonable for Berkeley Burke to have undertaken due 
diligence in respect of the investment before allowing it into the SIPP wrapper, and that if it 
had done so, it would have refused to accept the investment. The ombudsman found 
Berkeley Burke had therefore not complied with its regulatory obligations and had not treated 
its client fairly.
Jacobs J, having set out some paragraphs of BBA including paragraph 162 set out above, 
said (at paragraph 104):
These passages explain the overarching nature of the Principles. As the FCA 
correctly submitted in their written argument, the role of the Principles is not merely to 
cater for new or unforeseen circumstances. The judgment in BBA shows that they 
are, and indeed were always intended to be, of general application. The aim of the Principles-based regulation described by Ouseley J. was precisely not to attempt to 
formulate a code covering all possible circumstances, but instead to impose general 
duties such as those set out in Principles 2 and 6.
The BBSAL judgment also considers section 228 of FSMA and the approach an 
ombudsman is to take when deciding a complaint. The judgment of Jacobs J in the Berkeley 
Burke case upheld the lawfulness of the approach taken by the ombudsman in that 
complaint, which I have described above, and included the Principles and good industry 
practice at the relevant time as relevant considerations that were required to be taken into 
account.
As outlined above, Ouseley J in the BBA case held that it would be a breach of statutory 
duty if I were to reach a view on a complaint without taking the Principles into account in 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a case. And, Jacobs J 
adopted a similar approach to the application of the Principles in BBSAL. So the Principles 
are a relevant consideration here and I will consider them in the specific circumstances of 
this complaint
The Adams court cases and COBS 2.1.1R
I confirm I have taken account of the judgment of the High Court in the case of Adams v 
Options SIPP [2020] EWHC 1229 (Ch) and the Court of Appeal judgment in Adams v 
Options UK Personal Pensions LLP [2021] EWCA Civ 474. I note the Supreme Court 
refused Options permission to appeal the Court of Appeal judgement.
Ive considered whether these judgments mean that the Principles should not be taken into 
account in deciding this case. And I am of the view they do not. In the High Court case, HHJ 
Dight did not consider the application of the Principles and they did not form part of the 
pleadings submitted by Mr Adams. One of the main reasons why HHJ Dight found that the 
judgment of Jacobs J in BBSAL was not of direct relevance to the case before him was 
because the specific regulatory provisions which the learned judge in Berkeley Burke was 
asked to consider are not those which have formed the basis of the claimants case before 
me.
Likewise, the Principles were not considered by the Court of Appeal. So, the Adams 
judgments say nothing about the application of the FCAs Principles to the ombudsmans 
consideration of a complaint.
I acknowledge that COBS 2.1.1R (A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in 
accordance with the best interests of its client) overlaps with certain of the Principles and 
that this rule was considered by HHJ Dight in the High Court case. Mr Adams pleaded that 
Options SIPP owed him a duty to comply with COBS 2.1.1R, a breach of which, he argued, 
was actionable pursuant to section 138(D) of FSMA (the COBS claim). HHJ Dight rejected 
this claim and found that Options SIPP had complied with the best interests rule on the facts 
of Mr Adamss case.
Although the Court of Appeal ultimately overturned HHJ Dights judgment, it rejected that 
part of Mr Adamss appeal that related to HHJ Dights dismissal of the COBS claim on the 
basis that Mr Adams was seeking to advance a case that was radically different to that found 
in his initial pleadings. The Court found that this part of Mr Adamss appeal did not so much 
represent a challenge to the grounds on which HHJ Dight had dismissed the COBS claim, 
but rather was an attempt to put forward an entirely new case.
I note that, in the High Court case, HHJ Dight found that the factual context of a case would 
inform the extent of the duty imposed by COBS 2.1.1R. HHJ Dight said at para 148:In my judgment in order to identify the extent of the duty imposed by Rule 2.1.1 one 
has to identify the relevant factual context, because it is apparent from the 
submissions of each of the parties that the context has an impact on the 
ascertainment of the extent of the duty. The key fact, perhaps composite fact, in the 
context is the agreement into which the parties entered, which defined their roles and 
functions in the transaction.
The facts in Mr Ps case are very different from those in Adams. There are also significant 
differences between the breaches of COBS 2.1.1R alleged by Mr Adams and the issues in 
Mr Ps complaint. The breaches were summarised in paragraph 120 of the Court of Appeal 
judgment. In particular, HHJ Dight considered the contractual relationship between the 
parties in the context of Mr Adams pleaded breaches of COBS 2.1.1R that happened after 
the contract was entered into. In Mr Ps complaint, I am considering whether Options ought 
to have identified that the introductions from Caledonian involved a risk of consumer 
detriment and, if so, whether it ought to have ceased accepting introductions from 
Caledonian prior to entering into a contract with Mr P.
On this point I think it is also important to emphasise that I must determine this complaint by 
reference to what is, in my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. 
And, in doing that, Im required to take into account relevant considerations which include: 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
This is a clear and relevant point of difference between this complaint and the judgments in 
Adams. That was a legal claim which was defined by the formal pleadings in Mr Adamss 
statement of case.
To be clear, I have proceeded on the understanding that Options was not obliged  and not 
able  to give advice to Mr P on the suitability for him personally of a pension transfer or its 
SIPP or the FPI investment. But I am satisfied that the obligations of Options included 
deciding whether to accept particular investments into its SIPP and/or whether to accept 
introductions of business from particular businesses. And this is consistent with Options own 
understanding of its obligations at the relevant time. As noted above, the Options Non-
Regulated Introducer Profile completed at the outset of the relationship between Options and 
Caledonian said:
As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out.
Sections 27 and 28 of FSMA
The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court judgment on the basis of the claim pursuant 
to section 27 of FSMA. Section 27 of FSMA provides that an agreement between an 
authorised person and another party, which is otherwise properly made in the course of the 
authorised persons regulated activity, is unenforceable as against that other party if it is 
made:
in consequence of something said or done by another person (the third party) in 
the course of a regulated activity carried on by the third party in contravention of the 
general prohibition.
Section 27(2) provides that the other party is entitled to recover:
(a) any money or other property paid or transferred by him under the agreement; and(b) compensation for any loss sustained by him as a result of having parted with it.
Section 28(3) of FSMA provides that:
If the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable in the circumstances of the case, it 
may allow 
(a) the agreement to be enforced; or
(b) money and property paid or transferred under the agreement to be retained.
The general prohibition is set out in section 19 of FSMA. It stipulates that:
No person may carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom, or purport to do 
so, unless he is 
a) an authorised person; or
b) an exempt person.
In Adams, the Court of Appeal concluded that the unauthorised introducer of the SIPP had 
carried out activities in contravention of the general prohibition, and so section 27 of FSMA 
applied. It further concluded that it would not be just and equitable to nonetheless allow the 
agreement to be enforced (or the money retained) under the discretion afforded to it by 
section 28(3) of FSMA.
At paragraph 115 of the judgment the Court set out five reasons for reaching this conclusion. 
The first two of these were:
i) A key aim of FSMA is consumer protection. It proceeds on the basis that, while 
consumers can to an extent be expected to bear responsibility for their own 
decisions, there is a need for regulation, among other things to safeguard consumers 
from their own folly. That much reduces the force of Mr Greens contentions that Mr 
Adams caused his own losses and misled Carey;
ii) While SIPP providers were not barred from accepting introductions from 
unregulated sources, section 27 of FSMA was designed to throw risks associated 
with doing so onto the providers. Authorised persons are at risk of being unable to 
enforce agreements and being required to return money and other property and to 
pay compensation regardless of whether they had had knowledge of third parties 
contraventions of the general prohibition
The other three reasons, in summary, were:
The volume and nature of business being introduced by the introducer was such as 
to put Options on notice of the danger that the introducer was recommending clients 
to invest in the investments and set up Options SIPPs to that end. There was thus 
reason for Options to be concerned about the possibility of the introducer advising on 
investments within the meaning of article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (the RAO).
Options was aware that: contrary to what the introducer had previously said, it was 
receiving high commission from the investment provider, there were indications that 
the introducer was offering consumers cashback and one of those running the 
introducer was subject to a FCA warning notice.The investment did not proceed until after the time by which Options had reasons for 
concern and so it was open to Options to decline the investment, or at least explore 
the position with Mr Adams, but it did not do so.
Regulatory publications
The FCA (and its predecessor, the FSA) has issued the following publications which remind 
SIPP operators of their obligations and set out how they might achieve the outcomes 
envisaged by the Principles, namely:
The 2009 and 2012 thematic review reports
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter
The 2009 report
The 2009 report included the following statement:
We are very clear that SIPP operators, regardless of whether they provide advice, 
are bound by Principle 6 of the Principles for Businesses (a firm must pay due 
regard to the interests of its clients and treat them fairly) insofar as they are obliged 
to ensure the fair treatment of their customers. COBS 3.2.3(2) states that a member 
of a pension scheme is a client for COBS purposes, and Customer in terms of 
Principle 6 includes clients.
It is the responsibility of SIPP operators to continuously analyse the individual risks to 
themselves and their clients, with reference to the six TCF consumer outcomes.
We agree that firms acting purely as SIPP operators are not responsible for the SIPP 
advice given by third parties such as IFAs. However, we are also clear that SIPP 
operators cannot absolve themselves of any responsibility, and we would expect 
them to have procedures and controls, and to be gathering and analysing 
management information, enabling them to identify possible instances of financial 
crime and consumer detriment such as unsuitable SIPPs. Such instances could then 
be addressed in an appropriate way, for example by contacting the member to 
confirm the position, or by contacting the firm giving advice and asking for 
clarification. Moreover, while they are not responsible for the advice, there is a 
reputational risk to SIPP operators that facilitate the SIPPs that are unsuitable or 
detrimental to clients.
Of particular concern were firms whose systems and controls were weak and 
inadequate to the extent that they had not identified obvious potential instances of 
poor advice and/or potential financial crime. Depending on the facts and 
circumstances of individual cases, we may take enforcement action against SIPP 
operators who do not safeguard their clients interests in this respect, with reference 
to Principle 3 of the Principles for Business (a firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk 
management systems).
The following are examples of measures that SIPP operators could consider, taken 
from examples of good practice that we observed and suggestions we have made to 
firms:Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that intermediaries that advise 
clients are authorised and regulated by the FSA, that they have the appropriate 
permissions to give the advice they are providing to the firms clients, and that 
they do not appear on the FSA website listing warning notices.
Having Terms of Business agreements governing relationships, and clarifying 
respective responsibilities, with intermediaries introducing SIPP business.
Routinely recording and reviewing the type (i.e. the nature of the SIPP 
investment) and size of investments recommended by intermediaries that give 
advice and introduce clients to the firm, so that potentially unsuitable SIPPs can 
be identified.
Being able to identify anomalous investments, e.g. unusually small or large 
transactions or more esoteric investments such as unquoted shares, together 
with the intermediary that introduced the business. This would enable the firm to 
seek appropriate clarification, e.g. from the client or their adviser, if it is 
concerned about the suitability of what was recommended.
Requesting copies of the suitability reports provided to clients by the intermediary 
giving advice. While SIPP operators are not responsible for advice, having this 
information would enhance the firms understanding of its clients, making the 
facilitation of unsuitable SIPPs less likely.
Routinely identifying instances of execution-only clients who have signed 
disclaimers taking responsibility for their investment decisions, and gathering and 
analysing data regarding the aggregate volume of such business.
Identifying instances of clients waiving their cancellation rights, and the reasons 
for this.
The later publications
In the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance, the FCA said:
This guide, originally published in September 2009, has been updated to give firms 
further guidance to help meet the regulatory requirements. These are not new or 
amended requirements, but a reminder of regulatory responsibilities that became a 
requirement in April 2007.
All firms, regardless of whether they do or do not provide advice must meet Principle 6 
and treat customers fairly. COBS 3.2.3(2) is clear that a member of a pension scheme is 
a client for SIPP operators and so is a customer under Principle 6. It is a SIPP 
operators responsibility to assess its business with reference to our six TCF consumer 
outcomes.
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance also set out the following:
Relationships between firms that advise and introduce prospective members and SIPP 
operators
Examples of good practice we observed during our work with SIPP operators include the 
following:
Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that: introducers that advise clients are authorised and regulated by the FCA; that they have the appropriate permissions 
to give the advice they are providing; neither the firm, nor its approved persons are 
on the list of prohibited individuals or cancelled firms and have a clear disciplinary 
history; and that the firm does not appear on the FCA website listings for 
unauthorised business warnings.
Having terms of business agreements that govern relationships and clarify the 
responsibilities of those introducers providing SIPP business to a firm.
Understanding the nature of the introducers work to establish the nature of the firm, 
what their business objectives are, the types of clients they deal with, the levels of 
business they conduct and expect to introduce, the types of investments they 
recommend and whether they use other SIPP operators. Being satisfied that they are 
appropriate to deal with.
Being able to identify irregular investments, often indicated by unusually small or 
large transactions; or higher risk investments such as unquoted shares which may be 
illiquid. This would enable the firm to seek appropriate clarification, for example from 
the prospective member or their adviser, if it has any concerns.
Identifying instances when prospective members waive their cancellation rights and 
the reasons for this.
Although the members advisers are responsible for the SIPP investment advice given, 
as a SIPP operator the firm has a responsibility for the quality of the SIPP business it 
administers.
Examples of good practice we have identified include:
conducting independent verification checks on members to ensure the information 
they are being supplied with, or that they are providing the firm with, is authentic and 
meets the firms procedures and are not being used to launder money
having clear terms of business agreements in place which govern relationships and 
clarify responsibilities for relationships with other professional bodies such as 
solicitors and accountants, and
using non-regulated introducer checklists which demonstrate the SIPP operators 
have considered the additional risks involved in accepting business from 
nonregulated introducers
In relation to due diligence the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance said:
Due diligence
Principle 2 of the FCAs Principles for Businesses requires all firms to conduct their 
business with due skill, care and diligence. All firms should ensure that they conduct and 
retain appropriate and sufficient due diligence (for example, checking and monitoring 
introducers as well as assessing that investments are appropriate for personal pension 
schemes) to help them justify their business decisions. In doing this SIPP operators 
should consider:
ensuring that all investments permitted by the scheme are permitted by HMRC, or 
where a tax charge is incurred, that charge is identifiable, HMRC is informed and the 
tax charge paidperiodically reviewing the due diligence the firm undertakes in respect of the 
introducers that use their scheme and, where appropriate enhancing the processes 
that are in place in order to identify and mitigate any risks to the members and the 
scheme
having checks which may include, but are not limited to:
oensuring that introducers have the appropriate permissions, qualifications and 
skills to introduce different types of business to the firm, and
oundertaking additional checks such as viewing Companies House records, 
identifying connected parties and visiting introducers
ensuring all third-party due diligence that the firm uses or relies on has been 
independently produced and verified
good practices we have identified in firms include having a set of benchmarks, or 
minimum standards, with the purpose of setting the minimum standard the firm is 
prepared to accept to either deal with introducers or accept investments, and
ensuring these benchmarks clearly identify those instances that would lead a firm to 
decline the proposed business, or to undertake further investigations such as 
instances of potential pension liberation, investments that may breach HMRC tax 
relievable investments and non-standard investments that have not been approved 
by the firm
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter provides a further reminder that the Principles apply and an 
indication of the FCAs expectations about the kinds of practical steps a SIPP operator might 
reasonably take to achieve the outcomes envisaged by the Principles.
The Dear CEO letter also sets out how a SIPP operator might meet its obligations in 
relation to investment due diligence. It says those obligations could be met by:
Correctly establishing and understanding the nature of an investment
Ensuring that an investment is genuine and not a scam, or linked to fraudulent 
activity, money-laundering or pensions liberation
Ensuring that an investment is safe/secure (meaning that custody of assets is 
through a reputable arrangement, and any contractual agreements are correctly 
drawn-up and legally enforceable)
Ensuring that an investment can be independently valued, both at point of purchase 
and subsequently
Ensuring that an investment is not impaired (for example that previous investors have 
received income if expected, or that any investment providers are credit worthy etc)
Although Ive referred to selected parts of the publications, to illustrate their relevance, Ive 
considered them in their entirety.
I acknowledge that the 2009 and 2012 reports and the Dear CEO letter arent formal 
guidance (whereas the 2013 finalised guidance is). However, the fact that the reports and 
Dear CEO letter didnt constitute formal guidance doesnt mean their importance should be 
underestimated. They provide a reminder that the Principles for Businesses apply and are an indication of the kinds of things a SIPP operator might do to ensure it is treating its 
customers fairly and produce the outcomes envisaged by the Principles. In that respect the 
publications, which set out the regulators expectations of what SIPP operators should be 
doing, also goes some way to indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice 
and I am, therefore, satisfied it is appropriate to take them into account.
Its relevant that when deciding what amounted to have been good industry practice in the 
BBSAL case, the ombudsman found that the regulators reports, guidance and letter go a 
long way to clarify what should be regarded as good practice and what should not. And the 
judge in BBSAL endorsed the lawfulness of the approach taken by the ombudsman.
Like the ombudsman in the BBSAL case, I dont think the fact the publications (other than 
the 2009 Thematic Review Report) post-date the events that took place in relation to Mr Ps 
complaint, mean that the examples of good practice they provide were not good practice at 
the time of the relevant events. Although the later publications were published after the 
events subject to this complaint, the Principles that underpin them existed throughout, as did 
the obligation to act in accordance with the Principles.
Its also clear from the text of the 2009 and 2012 reports (and the Dear CEO letter in 2014) 
that the regulator expected SIPP operators to have incorporated the recommended good 
practices into the conduct of their business already. So, whilst the regulators comments 
suggest some industry participants understanding of how the good practice standards 
shaped what was expected of SIPP operators changed over time, it is clear the standards 
themselves had not changed.
I note that HHJ Dight in the Adams case didnt consider the 2012 thematic review, 2013 
SIPP operator guidance and 2014 Dear CEO letter to be of relevance to his consideration 
of Mr Adams claim. But it doesnt follow that those publications are irrelevant to my 
consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Im 
required to take into account good industry practice at the relevant time. And, as mentioned, 
the publications indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice at the relevant 
time.
That doesnt mean that, in considering what is fair and reasonable, I will only consider the 
actions of Options with these documents in mind. The reports, Dear CEO letter and 
guidance gave non-exhaustive examples of good industry practice. They didnt say the 
suggestions given were the limit of what a SIPP operator should do. As the annex to the 
Dear CEO letter notes, what should be done to meet regulatory obligations will depend on 
the circumstances.
To be clear, I dont say the Principles or the publications obliged Options to ensure the 
pension transfer was suitable for Mr P. I accept Options wasnt required to advise Mr P, and 
couldnt advise him. And I accept the publications dont alter the meaning of, or the scope of, 
the Principles. But theyre evidence of what I consider to have been good industry practice at 
the relevant time, which would bring about the outcomes envisaged by the Principles.
What did Options obligations mean in practice?
In this case, the business Options was conducting was its operation of SIPPs. Im satisfied 
that meeting its regulatory obligations when conducting this business would include deciding 
whether to accept or reject particular investments and/or referrals of business. The 
regulatory publications provided some examples of good industry practice observed by the 
FSA and FCA during their work with SIPP operators including being satisfied that a particular 
introducer is appropriate to deal with.As noted above, its clear from Options non-regulated introducer profile, that it understood 
and accepted that its obligations meant it had a responsibility to carry out due diligence on 
Caledonian.
Im satisfied that, to meet its regulatory obligations, when conducting its business, Options 
was required to consider whether to accept or reject particular referrals of business, with the 
Principles in mind. This seems consistent with its own understanding  as the Options 
Compliance Officer noted in an email on 26 April 2013:
We have a responsibility to proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure 
our products do not end up with customers for whom it is not suitable.
And I note in submissions on other complaints Options has told us that adherence to TCF 
(treating customers fairly) is something it had in mind when considering its approach to 
introducer due diligence i.e. the question of whether it should accept business from a 
particular introducer.
All in all Im satisfied that, to meet the appropriate standards of good industry practice and 
the obligations set by the regulators rules and regulations, Options shouldve carried out due 
diligence on Caledonian which was consistent with good industry practice and its regulatory 
obligations at the time. And in my opinion Options shouldve used the knowledge it gained 
from its due diligence to decide whether to accept or reject a referral of business or particular 
investment.
Summary of my decision
As set out above, the 2009 Thematic Review Report deals specifically with the relationships 
between SIPP operators and introducers or intermediaries. And it gives non exhaustive 
examples of good practice. In my view, to meet these standards, and its regulatory 
obligations, set by the Principles, Options ought to have identified a significant risk of 
consumer detriment arising from the business model Caledonian described to it at the 
outset. And so Options ought to have ensured it thought very carefully about accepting 
applications from Caledonian.
I acknowledge Options did take some steps  initially and on an ongoing basis  which did 
amount to good practice consistent with its regulatory obligations. But I think, acting fairly 
and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and good industry practice, Options had 
reason at the outset  and certainly by the time it received Mr Ps application on 24 July 
2012  to have significant concerns about the business Caledonian would be introducing. 
And it ought to have taken the sort of action it took in April and May 2013  which effectively 
ended its relationship with Caledonian  before the relationship with Caledonian began. 
Acting fairly and reasonably, Options should have:
Been aware  or at least concluded there was a significant risk  at the outset of its 
relationship with Caledonian, that Caledonian was giving advice on the transfer out of 
existing defined benefit schemes to the SIPP and the FPI investment.
Been aware that Caledonian was arranging the transfer out of defined benefit 
schemes to the SIPP and the FPI investment too.
Sought clarification on where these activities were taking place.
Concluded Caledonian was, in at least some instances carrying out regulated 
activities in the UK.Further, Options shouldve recognised, and promptly reacted to, the following risks of 
consumer detriment:
Caledonians staff didnt have the qualifications  and therefore expertise  to give 
advice on defined benefit pension transfers.
There was no evidence to show a proper advice process had been followed and 
consumers such as Mr P were therefore unable to make fully informed decisions 
about the transfer to the SIPP and investment in the FPI bond.
Caledonian proposed/brought a high volume of business.
Caledonian was taking a high level of commission.
Caledonian had failed to provide its company accounts, despite repeated requests 
for copies of them by Options.
I think these points  individually and cumulatively  should have led Options, acting fairly 
and reasonably, to have concluded at the outset  and certainly by the time of Mr Ps 
application  that it should not accept business from Caledonian. And so Mr Ps application 
shouldnt have proceeded.
It follows that its fair and reasonable to uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Because Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint on the basis that Options shouldnt have 
accepted his introduction from Caledonian, its not necessary for me to consider whether or 
not Options shouldve allowed the FPI investment in Mr Ps SIPP. I make no findings about 
Options actions in relation to the appropriateness of the FPI investment for the Options 
SIPP.
Ive set out my view in more detail below.
What activities did Caledonian undertake and what should Options have concluded?
Advice
I note that in its response to the Investigators view Options said it didnt at any point become 
aware that Caledonian was providing advice. This is a surprising assertion, given Options 
recorded in March 2013, when assessing Caledonian, under the heading Advice:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?
Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
And so it seems Options understood at this point that advice was being given. To ask 
questions about how and where advice was being given, the conclusion must first have been 
reached that advice was being given. There is nothing to suggest this was a view it had 
recently reached  rather it seems that it was an existing understanding which was being 
flagged as an issue for the first time.
When further action on this point was eventually taken by Options a member of its staff said 
on 30 April 2013:No they [Caledonian] don't [give advice], they consult with the client on the feasibility 
of transferring their Armed Forces Pension Scheme into a SIPP
This seems to be an effort to back-track on the earlier answers given to the questions in the 
26 April 2013 email, which appear to accept Caledonian was giving advice, although much 
else was unknown. But, to my mind, describing Caledonians role as consulting on the 
feasibility of doing something is simply another way of describing an advisory role. It would 
also have been clear to Options that Caledonians role wasnt limited to advice on the 
transfer out of the consumers existing scheme  it was declared on the FPI applications that 
Caledonian was giving advice on the bond too, and so any consulting was not solely limited 
to the transfer out from the existing scheme. This was clearly not viewed by Options as a 
satisfactory answer to this point in any event as its enquiries continued and, on 10 May 
2013, Options asked Caledonian:
Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.
This shows Options was clearly of the view at this point that, at the very least, Caledonian 
might be giving advice as there is no other basis on which it could have sought clarification 
from Caledonian as to whether advice was being given.
It seems this was a view Options maintained. As set out above, it later noted:
Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were raised 
regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through an 
unregulated entity.
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case
And it ultimately concluded in May 2013 that all business should come to it through a UK IFA 
with permissions to give pension transfer advice  an unusual step to take if it did not remain 
of the view there was at least a risk Caledonian was giving advice. Although Options has 
said it took that step as a wider policy decision and not as a response to concerns about 
Caledonian, the evidence it gave about that wider policy decision suggested that the wider 
policy decision was made in 2014, and was based on reviews and considerations which 
mostly took place after May 2013. The decision as it related to Caledonian appears to be set 
out in a document from May 2013 headed Caledonian Relationship Review 2013. The 
above suggests to me that Options knew  or suspected  that advice was being given from 
the outset, but that it took a reactive, piecemeal approach to addressing this obvious risk.
Furthermore, from the information available to Options at the outset of its relationship with 
Caledonian, there was a clear identifiable risk that Caledonian was giving advice. 
Caledonian said, at the outset, it was:
preferred adviser for the Armed Forces occupational pension scheme
a consultant to these clients and advised them on their armed forces transfers only
currently putting them into an international Friends Provident Bond
And Caledonians sales process was described as:
Referral  Visit  Analysis  VisitFinally, as mentioned, many of the FPI applications I have seen confirm Caledonian was 
giving advice (in Jordan  a point Ill turn to below) and Options would have been privy to 
many of these forms from an early stage in its relationship with Caledonian.
I note it was recorded that Caledonian advised on the transfer only but it was also recorded 
that it was selecting the investment vehicle (the FPI bond). And it is also very difficult to see 
how advice on a transfer out did not encompass advice on where to transfer to (i.e. the 
SIPP)  particularly when it was clearly anticipated that all consumers would be transferring 
to an Options SIPP. It is not clear how this could happen without those consumers being 
advised to take this course of action.
Furthermore, the Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit process Caledonian describes is a 
typical advice process involving an initial meeting, information gathering and analysis, and a 
further meeting.
Options should also have been aware that its not usual for pension transfers to happen 
without the consumer receiving advice or a recommendation  and very unusual for this to 
happen at a rate of 50 a month, which Caledonian was proposing. Options shouldve 
concluded that it was simply implausible that such a large volume of consumers were 
deciding to transfer out of their existing schemes, open a SIPP with Options, and make the 
same FPI investments within the SIPP without being advised to do so.
I note the Options terms of business with Caledonian, signed September 2012 (but, Options 
says, in place since March 2012) said:
The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
the Act in relation to the SIPP  for the avoidance of doubt this includes reference to 
advice on the selection of The SIPP Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, 
taking benefits and HMRC rules
I also note the SIPP application form which was signed and dated by Mr P said:
This Form should be used if you are a client establishing a SIPP without advice. You 
have made this decision independently and are aware of the implications of this 
decision.
And:
As you do not have a Financial Adviser, your investment choices are your sole 
responsibility. You will instruct us and we will act on those instructions as long as it is 
an accepted investment in the Carey Pension Scheme.
But the Options members declaration included the following:
I confirm that I have received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian 
International and following this advice I wish to proceed with the transfer.
And, as already mentioned, the FPI application documents confirmed advice had been 
given.
So I dont think the application documents in this case gave Options any basis to conclude 
advice hadnt been given  particularly given what I say above. They present a confused, 
inconsistent, picture. And where the documents expressly said that Mr P had not been 
advised, they tended to indicate that Options hadnt advised Mr P.Taking account of the available evidence I consider that, in this case, Caledonian did advise 
Mr P on the merits of transferring his pension to the SIPP and investing in the FPI bond. It 
appears most likely that Caledonian proactively suggested to Mr P he consider transferring 
his occupational pension. Mr P says:
the adviser regularly visited my place of work and had approached a few of my 
work colleagues. During a meeting at my work place, I gave the advisor details of my 
existing Army Pension and he gave me a brief comparison against the Carey SIPP. 
He said with the Carey SIPP the returns on the investment would be better and I 
would be able to access it a lot sooner than my existing pension. I was told with the 
SIPP I would have more control over my pension rather than the military controlling 
it.
Ive seen no evidence to suggest Mr P had any intention of transferring his pension before 
he encountered Caledonian or that he was determined to transfer it irrespective of whether 
he received any help to do so, or who provided that help. Indeed, Mr P said he had doubts 
about transferring but trusted Caledonian as the professional. Mr P also said he had no 
investment experience which I think makes it unlikely that he decided without any advice that 
he should transfer and invest the pension entitlements held in his defined benefit pension. 
And although Mr P said Caledonian gave him the option to choose his own investment, Mr P 
invested in the FPI bond which was the same investment that other Caledonian clients 
invested in. Again, this means that in my view its more likely than not that Caledonian 
advised Mr P about the investment.
So, I am satisfied advice was given to Mr P by Caledonian in this case, and that, from the 
outset of its relationship with Caledonian, Options was (or at the very least ought to have 
been) aware, generally, that Caledonian was offering advice to consumers, or there was a 
significant risk it might be doing so.
Arranging
Its also clear from what Options was told by Caledonian at the outset  and from the 
available evidence in this complaint and others  that Caledonian was heavily involved in the 
arrangement of the transfer out of Mr Ps existing pension scheme to the SIPP and the 
investment of the cash transferred to the SIPP in the FPI bond. It clearly was not simply 
introducing Mr P to Options and leaving it to him to proceed with the application. It was 
involved in arranging the transfer out of Mr Ps existing pension to the SIPP, the setting up of 
the SIPP and in arranging the FPI bond and associated investments. Caledonian played an 
active part in gathering all the information and documents needed for things to proceed  
that is clear from the checklist included with the paperwork sent to Options. It also sent all 
the required information, forms, documents etc to all the parties involved, and dealt with any 
queries arising from these, as the named contact in the correspondence.
I think Options ought to have been aware of this. The extent of Caledonians involvement 
was clear from the application documentation Caledonian sent to Options.
Where were the activities taking place?
I havent seen any evidence that, prior to May 2013, Options established where Caledonian 
was carrying out its activities in relation to each application  including Mr Ps.
As set out above, Caledonian told Options at the outset that They [the consumers] were 
generally still resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various countries such as 
Thailand, Germany, Spain etc. It was also recorded that Caledonian had branches in Chile, Peru, Columbia, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland. And, as Options later noted, Caledonian 
also used a UK address.
Caledonian also told Options at the outset the Majority of business carried out in 
unregulated jurisdictions but where regulations apply we are licensed to carry out our 
activities.
And, as mentioned, the sales process adopted by Caledonian was set out as Referral  Visit 
 Analysis  Visit. So it was clear Caledonian was meeting consumers in person.
Furthermore, the Certificate of Non-Solicitation signed by Caledonian for FPI  to which 
Options was privy  said in each instance (as far as Im aware) The advice was given in 
Jordan.
Caledonian therefore gave what appears to be conflicting information. But Options ought to 
have been aware, from what was said by Caledonian, that it was possible Caledonian might 
be dealing with a UK resident consumer in the UK, or dealing with a consumer in any one of 
a number of different countries, all of which might have different financial services regulatory 
regimes (or no such regime).
It is fair to say the picture was far from clear  and Options shouldve been aware it was 
unlikely all of the information provided by Caledonian could be correct. It is not, for example, 
clear how the advice in every instance could have been given in Jordan when, by 
Caledonians own account, it had a number of offices around the world (none of which was 
in Jordan), was dealing with consumers who were generally still resident in UK or living 
abroad in various countries and said elsewhere that it was carrying out business in various 
jurisdictions.
Options didnt however check any of this at the outset. It was therefore in no position to know 
what, if any, regulatory regimes applied, and whether Caledonian required any 
authorisations to conduct the activities it did. Caledonian itself appears to have suggested it 
needed licences in some jurisdictions, but Ive seen no evidence of it having given details of 
any such licences.
I think Options shouldve been particularly concerned  given that, as mentioned, 
Caledonian told Options the consumers it dealt with were generally still resident in UK - 
about whether advice was being given (or any other regulated activity carried on) in the UK 
as Caledonian was not authorised by the FSA nor, later, the FCA. There was reason, as Ive 
explained, to think Caledonian might be breaching the general prohibition against persons 
carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation.
Despite this, Ive seen no evidence to show Options identified this risk until March 2013 
when, as set out above, it was noted:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?
Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
Then no further action appears to have been taken until 26 April 2013 when, in a further 
internal email exchange at Options, the following questions were asked, and answers were 
received on 30 April 2013 (the below, in bold, are the first set of answers provided on this 
date):Do they have a business address in the UK? They confirm that they do not have a 
permanent place of business in the UK, however they have a business address 
for correspondence and [Mr C] is based in the UK.
Where do they meet with clients, i.e. in the UK? Unknown.
What is Caledonian's regulatory status, i.e. are they regulated in their home 
jurisdiction? [Mr C] - The Chartered Insurance Institute  [ID Number provided]. 
[Mr C] certifies all ID and signs the investment Application Form.
Are they regulated to provide advice in their home jurisdiction? Unknown
They have confirmed that they provide advice in Jordan. How does this work? Do 
they have a place of business in Jordan? Do they need to be regulated in Jordan to 
provide advice? Unknown - Caledonian provide a Non Solicitation Letter which 
is sent to Friends Provident with the investment App. A copy of a Non 
Solicitation Letter is attached
Despite the uncertainty it wasnt until 10 May 2013 when Options finally challenged 
Caledonian on this point (amongst others):
Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions 
What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in Jordan
On the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a permanent 
place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to be sent to The 
Pensions Service Centre, Peterborough. Please can you clarify Caledonian's 
presence in the UK and the nature of the office in Peterborough.
Given what I say above, acting fairly and reasonably, Options shouldve made these 
enquiries at the outset. And as set out in the background, these enquiries (along with the 
other points of query put to Caledonian and then discussed with it) led to Options quickly 
concluding it should not accept further applications from Caledonian unless they came 
through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer advice  a restriction which it 
seems had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. I think it fair to 
say that Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset 
of its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly shouldve done so, to act fairly and 
reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
In Mr Ps case, although his permanent address in 2012 was in the UK, he said he was 
working abroad when he had a meeting with Caledonian. And, although Caledonian had a 
UK address, the correspondence Ive seen in Mr Ps case uses an address in Switzerland. 
So, it seems unlikely that Caledonian carried out regulated activities in the UK in relation to 
Mr Ps case. But that doesnt mean that, in the interests of its customer, Options shouldnt 
have taken steps to establish the regulatory regime or regimes Caledonian was operating 
under. I think its also fair to say that in relation to other applications, from customers other than Mr P, Options ought to have been aware that regulated activities were taking place in 
the UK. And if Options had developed that awareness, as I believe it should have, through 
taking appropriate steps at the start of its relationship with Caledonian, then Options 
shouldve declined to enter a relationship with Caledonian at all or at least ended its 
relationship with Caledonian before accepting Mr Ps application. I think this was the only fair 
and reasonable step it could take in the circumstances.
Caledonians expertise
Caledonians proposed business model, as documented at Options first meeting with its 
representative, involved former members of the Armed Forces who, it said, worked in 
security related jobs in dangerous areas. The business model was not one involving, say, 
former financial advisers or other finance professionals. Mr P was working for a private 
security company when he met Caledonian.
There was therefore no reason to think the typical client Caledonian proposed to introduce to 
Options had a good understanding of pensions or was in a position to work out for 
themselves if a pension transfer was in their best interests. Theyd be reliant on 
Caledonians advice.
The introductions involved transfers out of a defined benefit pension scheme into a UK SIPP 
for investment in several investments within an FPI bond. The transfer of defined benefit 
pensions are usually not in customers best interests, are complex and present a variety of 
consequences and matters which the ordinary individual would be hard pressed to 
understand without professional financial advice. Those giving such advice in the UK are 
required by the FCA to pass specialist exams, reflecting the risks and complexities involved. 
Options, as a provider of SIPPs, would or ought to have been aware of this.
Not only did Caledonians advisers not have the qualifications required by the FCA (or FSA 
as it then was) to give advice on pension transfers, but theres also no evidence they had 
any relevant qualifications. The only qualification of any kind which was mentioned was that 
Mr C of Caledonian was a qualified accountant.
Ive seen no evidence to show Options noted this obvious risk until March 2013 when it 
reviewed its relationship with Caledonian and Professional Qualification was assessed as 
high risk. The reason for this assessment was No qualifications documented other than 
meeting note from March 2012 where [Mr C] stated he was a qualified accountant and 
member of Chartered Institute of Accountants.
And, despite this high risk flag, Ive seen no evidence Options took any action until 26 April 
2013 when it asked How did we establish Caledonians knowledge of SIPPs and UK 
pension rules? The answer to this was initially recorded on 30 April as unknown. The later 
answer on 30 April was, By meeting with them twice and by running a workshop for them 
output from which is attached. But I do not think this is enough to show Options had 
sufficiently addressed this risk  it does nothing to show Caledonian's staff had adequate 
qualifications or capabilities.
Again, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) was a point which led to 
Options concluding it shouldnt accept further applications from Caledonian unless they 
came through a UK IFA with permission to give pension transfer advice  a restriction which 
had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. And I think it fair to say 
Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset of its 
relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly shouldve done so to meet its regulatory 
obligations and standards of good practice.The transfer process
As mentioned above, a defined benefit transfer is a complex transaction. It also involves 
many risks, and potentially the loss of significant guaranteed benefits. For this reason, 
advice on such transactions is tightly regulated in the UK and there are standards of good 
practice that those giving the advice are expected to follow. This means several steps need 
to be taken as part of the advice process and documentation such as fact-finds, suitability 
reports, transfer analysis reports (TVAS), and illustrations generally feature in the advice 
process. The purpose is to ensure any advice given takes into account all relevant factors, is 
suitable, and the recipient of the advice is in a fully informed position, where they understand 
the benefits they are giving up and the risks associated with the transfer.
Ive seen no evidence to show Caledonian followed such a process. In my opinion it 
wouldve been fair and reasonable for Options to have identified this as a clear risk of 
consumer detriment  particularly given that Caledonians starting point appears to have 
been that the consumers it dealt with would be transferring out of the defined benefit scheme 
(i.e. it seems to have taken the view a transfer was suitable for all).
Had Options taken steps to ascertain whether a reasonable process was in place it wouldve 
become aware no such process was in place, and consumers were not therefore fully 
informed before agreeing to make the transfer to the SIPP and the associated FPI bond 
investments.
The reference by Options to Illustrations in the list of questions in the 26 April 2013 email 
and the initial answers to those questions appears to be an acknowledgement of this risk:
Based on our contact with Caledonian and reviewing the illustrations they provide to 
clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? 
Yes due to illustrations
Again, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) appears to be a point 
which led to Options concluding it shouldnt accept further applications from Caledonian 
except through a UK IFA with permission to give pension transfer advice  a restriction 
which had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. And I think it fair 
to say Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset of 
its relationship with Caledonian. And it shouldve done so, on a fair and reasonable basis to 
meet its regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
Volume of business
At the outset of the relationship between Options and Caledonian, Options was told 
Caledonian would introduce about 50 applications a month (and I note a similar volume was 
introduced, once the relationship began).
I think on a fair and reasonable basis, Options shouldve been concerned that Caledonian 
intended to (and did) make such a high volume of introductions, relating only to occupational 
pension schemes. In my view this was a further reason for Options to conclude there was a 
significant risk of consumer detriment  particularly when considered alongside the other 
points Ive set out here.
Firstly, its not clear how Caledonian would be, or was, bringing about such a high volume of 
applications without giving advice. It was simply implausible it could bring about this number 
of applications without influencing consumers actions through a positive recommendation. 
Options also ought to have considered Caledonians competence to deal with this volume of 
transfers  theres no evidence to show it had the significant resources this would require.Further, Options shouldve been aware of the very low likelihood that the transfers would all 
be suitable. At the outset of the relationship between Options and Caledonian (and at the 
time of Mr Ps application) COBS 19.1.6G said:
When advising a retail client who is, or is eligible to be, a member of a defined 
benefits occupational pension scheme whether to transfer or opt out, a firm should 
start by assuming that a transfer or opt out will not be suitable (my emphasis). A firm 
should only then consider a transfer or opt out to be suitable if it can clearly 
demonstrate, on contemporary evidence that the transfer or opt out is in the clients 
best interest.
I accept this aims to define the expectation of a regulated financial adviser when determining 
suitability of a pension transfer but Id expect Options, as a pensions provider, to have been 
aware of this and taken account of it.
Finally, Options had cause to question the motivations of Caledonian, if it were bringing 
about such a high volume of applications. There was a clear risk that Caledonian was putting 
its own interests above those of Mr P.
Commission
I also think the level of commission that was being paid to Caledonian shouldve given 
Options cause for concern.
It appears Caledonian was typically taking around 7% of the transfer amount in commission, 
and Options was told this was the case at the outset of its relationship with Caledonian. As 
noted earlier in my findings, theres no evidence to show Caledonian carried out any of the 
usual work associated with a defined benefit transfer that would justify such a fee. Nor have I 
seen any other evidence to show there was any justification for such a high level of 
commission in the circumstances. I think this level of commission ought to have been 
another cause for Options to be concerned that Caledonian was putting its own interests 
ahead of the interests of consumers, including Mr P. And of course it was further reason to 
consider Caledonian might be giving advice, as commission at this level wouldve been very 
likely to motivate it to encourage consumers to proceed, through a positive recommendation.
Overall, when considered alongside the high volumes of near identical introductions of 
business being made by Caledonian I think this level of commission raises questions about 
the motives and role of Caledonian.
Caledonians Accounts
I note that Options made repeated requests for Caledonian's accounts. It sent several emails 
to Caledonian between March and August 2012. Options also explained in its email of 23 
March 2012 that, to comply with its own compliance procedures, it needed the accounts.
Nevertheless, on 27 April 2012 Options started accepting introductions from Caledonian 
having not received the accounts  seemingly in breach of its own procedures. Acting fairly 
and reasonably, Options shouldve met its own standards and shouldve checked 
Caledonians accounts at the outset before accepting any business from it. And, based on 
Caledonians conduct, it seems very unlikely accounts would ever have been forthcoming.
Caledonians reluctance to provide basic information should also have been a further factor 
which ought to have led Options to question whether it should enter into or continue a 
relationship with Caledonian. This again calls into question the competence and motivations 
of Caledonian and it also calls into question the ability of Caledonian to organise its affairs. It also meant Options was missing information which might be critical to the decision about 
whether to enter into business with Caledonian, such as, for example, information about the 
nature, volume and location of Caledonians business, and its resources to carry on that 
business.
It is notable that Options accepted and set up Mr Ps SIPP when it was still waiting for this 
information from Caledonian.
In conclusion
Taking all of the above into consideration  individually and cumulatively  I think in the 
circumstances its fair and reasonable for me to conclude that Options ought reasonably to 
have concluded, had it complied with its regulatory obligations which required it to conduct 
sufficient due diligence on Caledonian and draw fair and reasonable conclusions from what it 
discovered, that it shouldnt accept business from Caledonian, including Mr Ps application. I 
therefore conclude that it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances to say Options 
shouldnt have accepted Mr Ps application from Caledonian.
Did Options act fairly and reasonably in proceeding with Mr Ps instructions?
In my view, for the reasons given, Options simply shouldve refused to accept Mr Ps 
application. So things shouldnt have got beyond that. However, for completeness, Ive 
considered whether it was fair and reasonable for Options to proceed with Mr Ps 
application.
I acknowledge Mr P was asked to sign a members declaration. I note this document gives 
warnings about the loss of benefits that would result in the transfer to the SIPP. And the 
indemnities sought to confirm that Mr P wouldnt hold Options responsible for any losses 
resulting from the investments. However, I dont think this document demonstrates Options 
acted fairly and reasonably by proceeding with Mr Ps instructions.
Asking Mr P to sign a declaration absolving Options of all its responsibilities when it ought to 
have known that Mr Ps dealings with Caledonian were putting him at significant risk was not 
the fair and reasonable thing to do. I also note that the declaration was based on Mr P 
having received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian International where, for the 
reasons Ive given, Options ought to have been aware Caledonian didnt have the 
competency to give such advice and there were questions about its motivations and 
integrity.
Asking Mr P to sign declarations was not an effective way for Options to meet its regulatory 
obligations, given the concerns Options ought to have identified about his introduction. So, it 
was not fair and reasonable to proceed, on the basis of these. I make this point only for 
completeness  the primary point is Mr P should simply not have been able to proceed, as 
his application should simply not have been accepted.
Fair compensation
I note Options says, in its response to the Investigators view, that its evident that Mr P 
wished to transfer his pension, whether through Options or another provider and would 
therefore have suffered the same loss as he did even if it had rejected his application.
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P wouldve proceeded even if Options had rejected 
his application. He encountered Caledonian at his workplace where he said his colleagues 
had been approached by Caledonian. And his representative said Caledonian approached 
Mr P  which was consistent with Caledonians business model of contacting ex-servicemen and encouraging them to consider transferring out of their pensions. Ive seen nothing to 
suggest he was looking to make a transfer prior to that contact. And Mr P has said he was 
unsure about transferring but went ahead because he trusted Caledonian as the 
professional.
I havent, in any event, seen any evidence that any other SIPP operator dealt with 
Caledonian. And any operator acting fairly and reasonably shouldve reached the conclusion 
that it shouldnt deal with Caledonian. I dont think itd be fair to say Mr P shouldnt be 
compensated based on speculation that another SIPP operator might have made the same 
mistakes as Options.
For similar reasons, Im not persuaded Mr P shouldnt be compensated by Options, or his 
compensation should be reduced, because I havent made the finding that the FPI bond 
investment, in itself, was not something Options should have accepted. Or because the 
benefits from Mr Ps existing pension were lost once the transfer request was made. If 
Options had acted fairly and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and good industry 
practice, the application wouldnt have proceeded at all. So no transfer request or FPI bond 
investment would have been made.
So, Im satisfied that Options failure to comply with its regulatory obligations and industry 
best practice at the relevant time have led to Mr P suffering a loss to his pension. And my 
aim is therefore to return Mr P to the pension position he would now be in but for Options 
failings.
When considering this Ive taken into account the Court of Appeals supplementary judgment 
in Adams ([2021] EWCA Civ 1188), insofar as that judgment deals with 
restitution/compensation.
Putting things right
In light of my above findings, I require that Options calculate fair compensation by comparing 
the current position to the position Mr P would be in if he hadnt transferred from his existing 
pension. In summary, Options should:
1. Calculate the loss Mr P has suffered as a result of making the transfer.
2. Take ownership of any investments which cant be surrendered, if possible.
3. Pay compensation for the loss into Mr Ps pension. If thats not possible, pay 
compensation for the loss to Mr P direct. In either case the payment should take into 
account necessary adjustments set out below.
4. Pay Mr P £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its failure to act fairly 
and reasonably.
Ill explain how Options should carry out the calculation set out at 1-3 above in further detail 
below.
(1) Calculate the loss Mr P has suffered as a result of making the transfer (the loss 
calculation)
In my view Options should calculate this loss in line with The FCAs pension review 
guidance, in line with the latest guidance in FG17/9, using the most recent financial 
assumptions published.I am aware that on 2 August 2022, the FCA launched a consultation on changes to this 
guidance and has set out its proposals in a consultation document - 
https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp22-15.pdf
In this consultation, the FCA said that it considers that the current methodology in FG17/9 
remains appropriate and fundamental changes are not necessary. However, its review has 
identified some areas where the FCA considers it could improve or clarify the methodology 
to ensure it continues to provide appropriate redress.
Nevertheless, the basic objective of the proposed amendments still remains to put a 
consumer, as far as possible, into the position they would be in if the business had advised 
them to remain in the DB scheme.
A policy statement was published on 28 November 2022 which set out the new rules and 
guidance  https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps22-13.pdf. The new rules will come 
into effect on 1 April 2023.
The FCA has said it expects firms to continue to calculate and offer compensation to their 
customers using the existing guidance in FG 17/9 for the time being. But until changes take 
effect, firms should give customers the option of waiting for their compensation to be 
calculated in line with the new rules and guidance.
Weve previously asked Mr P whether he preferred any redress to be calculated now in line 
with current guidance or wait for the new guidance /rules to come into effect.
He didnt make a choice. So, as set out previously, Ive assumed in this case he doesnt 
want to wait for the new guidance to come into effect. 
I am satisfied that a calculation in line with FG17/9 remains appropriate and, if a loss is 
identified, will provide fair redress for Mr P. 
If the complaint hasnt been settled in full and final settlement by the time the new rules and 
guidance come into effect, Id expect Options to carry out a calculation in line with the 
updated rules and guidance in any event.
(2) Take ownership of any investments held within the SIPP which cannot be surrendered
In order for the SIPP to be closed and further SIPP fees to be prevented, the investment(s) 
need(s) to be removed from the SIPP. To do this, Options should calculate an amount it is 
willing to accept as a commercial value for any investments that cannot be surrendered and 
pay that sum into the SIPP and take ownership of the relevant investments. This amount 
should be taken into account for the loss calculation.
If Options is unwilling or unable to purchase the investment(s) the value of them should be 
assumed to be nil for the purposes of the loss calculation if the investments are not readily 
realisable (or for any portion of the investments which is not readily realisable). I appreciate 
such investments may have a realisable value in the future. So, for any investments 
assumed to be nil value Options may ask Mr P to provide an undertaking to account to it for 
the net amount of any payment the SIPP may receive from those investment(s) in the future. 
That undertaking should allow for the effect of any tax and charges on the amount Mr P may 
receive from the investment(s) and any eventual sums he would be able to access. Options 
should meet any costs in drawing up the undertaking.
If Options doesnt take ownership of the investment(s), and it/they continue to be held in 
Mr Ps SIPP, there will be ongoing fees in relation to the administration of that SIPP. Mr P wouldnt be responsible for those fees if Options hadnt accepted the transfer of his 
occupational pension into the SIPP. So, I think its fair and reasonable for Options to waive 
any SIPP fees until such time as Mr P can dispose of the investment(s) and close the SIPP.
(3) Pay compensation to Mr P for loss he has suffered calculated in (1)
Since the loss Mr P has suffered is within his pension it is right that I try to restore the value 
of his pension provision if that is possible. So, if possible, the compensation for the loss 
should be paid into his SIPP. The compensation shouldnt be paid into the pension if it would 
conflict with any existing protection or allowance. Payment into the pension should allow for 
the effect of charges and any available tax relief. This may mean the compensation should 
be increased to cover the charges and reduced to notionally allow for the income tax relief 
Mr P could claim. The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr Ps marginal rate of 
tax.
On the other hand, Options may not be able to pay the compensation into the SIPP. If so 
compensation for the loss should be paid to Mr P direct. But had it been possible to pay the 
compensation into the pension, it would have provided a taxable income.
Therefore, the compensation for the loss paid to Mr P should be reduced to notionally allow 
for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. The notional allowance should be 
calculated using Mr Ps marginal rate of tax in retirement. For example, if Mr P is likely to be 
a basic rate taxpayer in retirement, the notional allowance would equate to a reduction in the 
total amount equivalent to the current basic rate of tax. However, if Mr P would have been 
able to take a tax-free lump sum, the notional allowance should be applied to 75% of the 
total amount.
(4) Pay Mr P £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the failure to act fairly and 
reasonably
Mr P transferred his pension away from a valuable defined benefits pension to a SIPP and 
had to suffer the loss of those benefits. Mr P said the pension was his only pension at the 
time. I think its fair to say this wouldve caused Mr P some distress and inconvenience. So, I 
consider that a payment of £500 is appropriate to compensate for that upset.
The compensation resulting from the loss assessment must where possible be paid to Mr P 
within 90 days of the date Options receives notification of his acceptance of my final 
decision. Further interest must be added to the compensation amount at the rate of 8% per 
year simple from the date of this final decision to the date of settlement for any time, in 
excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr P this compensation.
Its possible that data gathering for a SERPS adjustment may mean that the actual time 
taken to settle goes beyond the 90 day period allowed for settlement above  and so any 
period of time where the only outstanding item required to undertake the calculation is data 
from DWP may be added to the 90 day period in which interest wont apply.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Options deducts income tax from the 
interest, it should tell Mr P how much has been taken off. Options should give Mr P a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mr P asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Reassignment of rights
If Options believes other parties to be wholly or partly responsible for the loss, it is free to 
pursue those other parties. So compensation payable to Mr P should be contingent on the assignment by him to Options of any rights of action he may have against other parties in 
relation to his transfer to the SIPP and the investments. The assignment should be given in 
terms that ensure any amount recovered by Options up to the balance due to Mr P is paid to 
him. Options should only benefit from the assignment once Mr P has been fully 
compensated for his loss.
Where I uphold a complaint, I can award fair compensation to be paid by a financial 
business of up to £160,000, plus any interest and/or costs/interest on costs that I think are 
appropriate. If I think that fair compensation is more than £160,000, I may recommend that 
the business pays the balance.
I do not know what award the above calculation might produce. So, whilst I acknowledge 
that the value of Mr Ps original investment was within our award limit, for completeness I 
have included information below about what ought to happen if fair compensation amounts 
to more than our award limit.
Decision and award: I uphold the complaint. Fair compensation should be calculated as 
shown above. My decision is that Options UK Personal Pensions LLP should pay Mr P the 
amount produced by that calculation  up to a maximum of £160,000 (including the £500 to 
compensate for the distress and inconvenience Options actions caused) plus interest at the 
rate of 8% per year simple from the date of my final decision to the date of settlement for any 
time, in excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr P this compensation.
Recommendation: If the amount produced by the calculation of fair compensation is more 
than £160,000, I recommend that Options pays Mr P the balance. This recommendation is 
not part of my determination or award. Options doesnt have to do what I recommend. 
Its unlikely that Mr P can accept my decision and go to court to ask for the balance after the 
money award has been paid. Mr P may want to get independent legal advice before deciding 
whether to accept this decision. 
If Options UK Personal Pensions LLP agrees to pay the full calculated redress, and elects to 
take an assignment of rights before paying compensation, it must first provide a draft of the 
assignment to Mr P for his consideration and agreement. Any expenses incurred for the 
drafting of the assignment should be met by Options UK Personal Pensions LLP.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. To put things right 
Options UK Personal Pensions LLP must calculate and pay Mr P the award set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2023.
