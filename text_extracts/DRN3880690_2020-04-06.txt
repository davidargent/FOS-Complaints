Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ms complaint in part and thought  instalment loans 6 to 14 (as 
set out in the table above)  should  not have been  given. Sunny didnt agree in full  it made 
an offer from loan 10 onwards. The complaint has now been passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN38806902the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for instalment loan 6 would most  likely 
have shown that Miss M was having some  trouble in managing  her money.  By the time loan 
6 was taken, Miss M was paying for one other loan with Sunny at the same time as well as 
paying two other short-term loans with other lenders. While the amounts had fluctuated,  
Sunny should  have  been concerned with Miss Ms borrowing pattern by the time loan 6 was 
taken. It was clear from this that Miss M wasnt using these high-cost loans to deal with a 
short-term cashflow problem. So, in these circumstances Sunny should have realised that 
she was having  problems managing money.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
instalment loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss M was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss Ms overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that she had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Miss M had borrowed on six 
Ref: DRN38806903occasions in almost six months  and whilst the amounts fluctuated,  they didnt 
significantly decrease over this period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship 
with Sunny. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances  and that Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  14 was 
taken out 11 months after Miss Ms first instalment loan. Miss M had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ms ability  to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept him/her  in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about instalment loans 6 to 14 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Miss M loans 6 to 14.
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts loans 12 to 14 Sunny should buy these back if it is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back  
then Sunny should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Miss M towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  
anything it has already refunded.
B)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Miss M 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Miss M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Miss M having made 
overpayments then Sunny  should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding  loans and any principal Sunny already 
written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Miss M. However if 
there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  
Ref: DRN38806904repayment plan with Miss M. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal Sunny has already written-off.
E)Sunny  should  remove any negative information recorded on Miss Ms credit  file in relation 
to loan 6. The overall pattern of Miss Ms borrowing for loans 7 to 14 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so you should  remove  these loans entirely 
from Miss Ms credit  file. Sunny  do not have to remove loans 12 to 14 from Miss Ms credit  
file until these have  been repaid, but Sunny  should still remove  any adverse information 
recorded about these loans.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss M a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 May 2020.
