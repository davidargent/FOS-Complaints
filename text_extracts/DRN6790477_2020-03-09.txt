K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) locked him out of his 
account and wouldnt  let him access his own money.
background
Mr G says he had an account with PayPal with £400 in it. But he wasnt  able to link it to his 
joint bank account  - his wifes PayPal account was already linked to it - so he wasnt able to 
access his own money.  Mr G told us:
over the years hes tried to access his account with no success  and now that he lives 
abroad, its become more difficult to contact  PayPal to resolve the matter.
hes telephoned PayPal on a number of occasions but been kept waiting for more 
than an hour and with the significant  time-zone difference this hasnt been easy.
hes emailed PayPal  and sent it the copy documentation required  in order to verify 
his identity, but hes still unable to access his account and withdraw his money.
the service hes received has been  very poor  he was asked  for SMS verification on 
a UK mobile number  he no longer  has; he was told hed been  sent messages but 
then received nothing; and although  hes spoken to a number of PayPal 
representatives, no-one will take ownership of the problem.
PayPal issued its Final Response Letter in February  2019.  It explained  that Mr Gs account 
had been restricted  in December 2010 because it needed additional verification. And it 
asked him to provide documentation to confirm his identity and address.
Our investigator looked at this complaint and said he thought it should be upheld and he 
thought that PayPal should pay Mr G £100 in recognition of the poor service hed received. 
He explained  that hed seen evidence that Mr G had sent PayPal the documents it required, 
and he liaised with Mr G and sent PayPal the evidence once again.
PayPal confused matters further  in September 2019  when it told this Service that it needed 
more time to investigate  Mr Gs complaint and it said it hadnt  yet issued a Final  Response 
Letter  even though we had a copy on file dated February 2019.
Our investigator explained that he believed PayPal now had what it needed  in order to 
unblock the account, and he provided it with Mr Gs authority to send the £400 to his wifes 
account. And although he wasnt going to comment on PayPals security  processes, he 
thought it should have  been possible for Mr G to access  his money far sooner. He asked 
PayPal to pay Mr G 8% interest for the time Mr G was deprived  of his own money  from 13 
August 2019 to the date it transferred the £400  to his wifes account.  And he asked it to pay 
Mr G £100 for the trouble  and upset  it had caused him.
PayPal disagrees  so the complaint comes  to me to decide. It says its now released Mr Gs 
£400, but it wont pay him compensation for what happened because  he shouldve  closed  
his UK account when  he moved abroad. And it doesnt believe its fair and reasonable that 
you are requesting PayPal to pay £100  compensation because  we have not been able to 
locate an email that was sent from an email address registered in PayPals system.
Ref: DRN67904772my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, Ive decided that this 
complaint should  be upheld.
PayPal says that Mr Gs account was restricted  in October 2010 and he provided  a copy  of 
his passport after 7 years,  2 months and 21 days. It says in February  2019  it asked Mr G to 
provide proof of his current address which he did apparently on 13 August 2019 after 5 
months and 19 days.  But this isnt relevant to my consideration of compensation.
Theres no dispute that it took Mr G several years to start the process  of accessing his 
money. And although  this may be slightly  unusual  behaviour, there  was no obligation on him 
to act any sooner.  But when  he did decide he wanted to access  his own money,  there was 
an obligation  on PayPal  to facilitate this.
PayPal told Mr G what documentation it needed  in order  to verify his identity, and Im 
satisfied Mr G fulfilled that requirement  - even if PayPal doesnt seem  to accept that, despite  
this Service sending it the relevant evidence. Again, PayPal makes  the point  that Mr G took 
more than five months to do this  but this doesnt  make a difference.  I say this because  until 
he provided the required paperwork, he couldnt  expect PayPal to fully engage with him and 
release his money. But equally, once he had provided the appropriate documentation, 
PayPal shouldve given  Mr G access to his own money.
Our investigator rightly  concluded that Mr G had done what he needed to do on 13 August 
2019, and Im satisfied  that PayPal should  pay interest from that date to the date it 
transferred the money to Mr Gs nominated account.  And Im also going  to ask PayPal to pay 
Mr G £100 in recognition  of the poor service it provided.
fair compensation
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA should:
Pay Mr G 8% simple  interest per annum on the £400 from 13 August 2019 to the 
date it transferred the money to Mr Gs nominated account.
Pay Mr G £100 in recognition of the poor level of service he received.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay fair compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
