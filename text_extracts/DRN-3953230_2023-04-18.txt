The complaint
Mr and Mrs J complain that National Westminster Bank Plc wont provide them with a 
valuation for the freehold which is the remaining security it holds over their property which 
was a block of flats.
What happened
Mr and Mrs J borrowed money from the bank. Mr and Mrs J developed a number of flats, 
and the bank took a charge for the loan secured on the property. Mr and Mrs J failed to 
repay the loan, the loan was passed to NatWests recoveries department in 2011 and 
NatWest appointed receivers in 2015. The receivers sold the flats, but the freehold remains. 
Mr and Mrs J want to offer payment for the freehold. NatWest instructed valuers but hasnt 
provided Mr and Mrs J with a valuation for the freehold.
NatWest said that it instructed a valuer, but the valuation came back inconclusive and no 
value for the freehold was provided. It also says that the valuation was for the banks 
purposes only. It says that it continues to discuss proposals for the outstanding debt that Mr 
and Mrs J owe of about £180,000.00. NatWest says that that due to recent declarations of ill 
health by Mr and Mrs J and an offer of £50,0000 in full and final settlement, its Specialist 
Support Team requested income and expenditure information to make a fair assessment of 
the offer. It says it requested this in November and December 2021. NatWest says that it 
also requested further information about their medical condition to determine how these 
might affect Mr and Mrs Js ability to meet their financial obligations.  
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld as he felt that 
NatWest had attempted to obtain a valuation but that had come back inconclusive and so it 
was reasonable for it not to rely on an inconclusive valuation. Mr and Mrs J disagreed and 
said that there should not have been an inconclusive valuation and there should be no 
problem selling the property.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs J borrowed money from NatWest on which interest is due. They were unable to 
pay it back and receivers were appointed. A substantial amount of the debt has been 
recovered but about £180,000 remains unpaid. The receivers were stood down and in the 
interim some negotiations began between Mr and Mrs J and NatWest. NatWest presumably 
wants the full debt paid and Mr and Mrs J suggest that they will pay the value of the freehold 
security and something more. I also see that £50,000 is mentioned.  At that stage NatWest 
appears to have looked for a valuation of the security but NatWest says that the valuation is 
inconclusive and hasnt provided Mr and Mrs J with a conclusive valuation.
But what has NatWest done wrong by not providing a valuation? Mr and Mrs J own the 
freehold which is subject to a charge as security for a debt to NatWest. If Mr and Mrs J want 
the freehold, they will have to pay off the debt to NatWest. It may or may not be the case that 
NatWest will accept a lower full and final settlement figure from Mr and Mrs J to release its 
security. That doesnt depend on the value of the freehold but rather whether NatWest is 
prepared to accept a reduction in the amount it is owed. I dont see what role the valuation of 
the security plays in that, so Im not convinced that Mr and Mrs J have been disadvantaged 
in any way by NatWest failing to obtain a conclusive valuation of the security. 
At this stage valuing the security is only relevant if NatWest was to accept Mr and Mrs Js 
offer of the value of the security and something more in full and final settlement of the debt. It 
may be that Mr and Mrs J may be concerned that NatWest would sell the freehold at an 
undervalue or the costs of sale may be too high. But no sale has occurred yet. I also see that 
£50,000 as a settlement was mentioned in a phone call in November 2021. But NatWest 
hasnt indicated that it would accept that, and I cant fairly require it to accept something less 
than the full payment of this debt which would appear to be due to it. Mrs J asks in her email 
of 1 February 2022 The bank has been unwilling to give a figure for the freehold so how are 
we to offer payment .  But the figure that NatWest requires payment for from Mr and Mrs J 
and is entitled to ask for it is the outstanding balance of the loan and not the value of the 
security. So, my view is that in failing to provide Mr and Mrs J with a valuation of the 
remaining freehold of this property NatWest has done nothing wrong and, so, I cant fairly 
uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J and Mr J to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 May 2023.
