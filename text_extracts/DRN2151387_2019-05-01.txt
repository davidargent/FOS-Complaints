K820x#14complaint
Mr T says Barclays Bank UK Plc (Barclays) mis-sold him Additions and Additions Plus 
packaged bank  accounts. Hes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ts complaint and didnt think Barclays had mis-sold the 
packaged accounts. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ts complaint. 
Free accounts  are widely available in the United Kingdom. And I think  Mr T wouldve known 
this as hed previously had one with Barclays. The information Ive seen on Mr Ts 
circumstances suggest he was eligible for and couldve used the main benefits included  on 
the Additions and Additions Plus accounts.  And while Im open to the possibility Mr T wasnt  
provided with absolutely everything  he shouldve  been, I havent  seen anything to suggest  
clearer information wouldve changed  his decision to take the accounts in the first place. 
I also think that Barclays let Mr T know that he was being migrated onto Tech, Travel Plus 
and Home packs when  it discontinued  the Premier Life account in 2015. So this wasnt  a 
sale of a packaged account  and it was up to Mr T to decide if he wished to accept the 
change. As Mr T kept the packs I dont think Barclays needs to refund the fees paid for them.
So overall Im not upholding the complaint and Barclays doesnt need  to refund any fees. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ts complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2019.
