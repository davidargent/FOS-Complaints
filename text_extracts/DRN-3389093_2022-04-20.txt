The complaint
A limited company Ill refer to as R complains that National Westminster Bank PLC 
(NatWest) blocked its account and prevented payments from entering and leaving the 
account. To put things right, R wants NatWest to apologise and pay $4,000 in compensation.
R is represented by once of its directors, Mr W.
What happened
On 6 December 2021, NatWest blocked Rs account meaning no transactions in or out could 
be made. When Mr W called NatWest to find out what had happened, he was told NatWest 
had tried to contact him and that he needed to provide certain information in order to update 
NatWests records. He duly submitted that information and the block was lifted on 9 
December 2021, but Mr W complained saying he was unhappy NatWest had blocked Rs 
account without prior notice.
NatWest investigated Rs complaint and issued its final response letter on 10 January 2022. 
It said it had written to R on 6 October and 5 November 2021, setting out details of the 
information it needed and asking Mr W to get in touch by 5 December 2021. And that it had 
said Rs account would be blocked if Mr W didnt get in touch by that date. It said it had also 
sent 2 text messages to Mr Ws mobile number, and had called him several times to chase a 
response.
It refunded R two payments of Â£12, being unpaid fees that accrued because payments 
bounced during the block. But it maintained it hadnt made a mistake, so it didnt uphold Rs 
complaint.
Mr W remained unhappy, so he brought Rs complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt 
uphold Rs complaint. He was satisfied NatWest was entitled to block Rs account in the 
circumstances, and he felt it had done enough to contact Mr W in advance. 
Mr W didnt agree, saying NatWest hadnt made any real attempt to contact him. He said he 
was banned from attending his offices due to Coronavirus restrictions, that he had asked to 
be contacted by email and he suggested he had acted reasonably in ignoring the calls from 
NatWest. He asked for an ombudsman to review the matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, Im satisfied NatWest was entitled to request the information it did, and that it was 
reasonable to block Rs account given it didnt receive a reply. Banks in the UK are strictly 
regulated and have various legal and regulatory obligations with which they must comply. 
Those regulations oblige them to keep up to date information about their customers, and Im 
satisfied that NatWest was complying with its obligations when it requested information from 
R, and when it subsequently blocked Rs account.
With that being said, the question here is whether or not NatWest did enough to contact R 
before it blocked its account. Having looked at the information both parties have provided, 
Im satisfied that it did. Ill explain why.
I understand Mr W says he had requested to be contacted by email, and Im satisfied he 
may not have seen the letters NatWest sent by post. NatWest said in its final response to R 
that it hadnt tried to contact Mr W by email as its system hadnt found his email address at 
the outset, and because the review team couldnt generate emails manually. In light of those 
problems, Id expect NatWest to take reasonable steps to contact R by other means.
NatWest has provided audit reports that show it sent 2 text messages to Mr Ws mobile 
phone and tried to call him on 6 separate occasions between November and December 
2021. And I can see Mr W was told to contact NatWest on the main number if he was 
uncomfortable taking an inbound call. In light of the additional attempted contacts, Im 
satisfied NatWest took reasonable steps to contact Mr W before it blocked Rs account and I 
dont think it ought reasonably to have taken further action before it blocked Rs account. 
NatWest blocked Rs account on 6 December and lifted the block on 9 December 2021, 
which Im satisfied was a reasonable timeframe in the circumstances of this complaint. Mr W 
has said he wanted $4,000 in compensation, representing 2 days of his time that he would 
have been able to charge, had he been able to think straight at work. And that his business 
had suffered huge repercussions in relation to its credit score as a result of NatWests 
actions. 
But, notwithstanding what Ive said above, I havent seen any evidence to demonstrate R 
lost $4,000 as a result of the block. Or that it suffered any other losses attributable to 
NatWests actions.
I recognise this isnt the outcome Mr W had hoped for. And I understand why hes frustrated 
at Rs account being blocked. But for the reason Ive set out above, Im satisfied NatWest 
was entitled to block the account, and that it took reasonable steps to contact R before it 
blocked the account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2022.
