The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with how MotoNovo Finance Limited reported his account to the credit 
reference agencies (CRA).
What happened
On 29 April 2016, Mr H was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement 
with MotoNovo. Mr H paid a deposit of £1,190.40, and the agreement was for £5,952 over 
61 months; with 59 monthly repayments of £150.72 and a final repayment of £309.72.
Mr H also took out additional life and payment protection insurance (PPI) which took his total 
payment to £164.73.
Mr H missed the payments for February, March, and April 2020, after a PPI claim he made 
was rejected. On 16 April 2020, Mr H agreed a payment arrangement with MotoNovo. 
However, he then missed the payments for October and November 2020. He asked 
MotoNovo for a payment deferral on 25 November 2020, but this was declined.
Mr H complained to MotoNovo that theyd recorded his payments incorrectly with the CRAs. 
And he said that, because hed had a payment arrangement in place during the coronavirus 
(Covid-19) pandemic, they shouldnt be recording missing payments. MotoNovo said they 
hadnt recorded the payment arrangement Mr H made for July to September 2020, and they 
amended his credit file for these months. They also paid Mr H £50 compensation for this.
Mr H then complained that MotoNovo were continuing to report arrears, even though he was 
making monthly payments. MotoNovo reviewed the matter and said that, even though they 
were reporting the number of months in arrears correctly, theyd incorrectly reported the 
amount. So, they amended this, and paid Mr H a further £50 compensation.
Mr H was still unhappy with this and brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said that the information reported by the CRAs should be fair, accurate, 
consistent, complete, and up to date. And, while this wasnt always the case, the information 
MotoNovo were reporting was a true and accurate reflection of the state of Mr Hs account. 
He also thought the £100 MotoNovo had paid Mr H was reasonable for the errors thatd 
been made. So, he didnt think they needed to do anything more.
I issued a provisional decision on 28 March 2022, where I explained my intention to uphold 
the complaint. In that decision I said:
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and what I consider was good 
industry practice at the time. Mr H was supplied with a car under a regulated consumer 
credit agreement which means were able to investigate complaints about it. 
Before I address this matter, I think it would be useful for me to explain the information 
recorded by the CRAs. They will record a number, usually between 0 and 6, which reflects 
the total amount of the arrears in monthly payments, for example if a customer were to only 
pay 75% of the payment for four months, then make a full payment for the next two months, 
it should be reported as 000111 (or sometimes 111000). This is because, although the full 
payment wasnt made for the first three months, the total amount of the arrears is less that 
one monthly payments, so its recorded as 0. And, although the full payment was made for 
months five and six, because the arrears werent cleared, the total amount of arrears for 
those months was still the equivalent of one months payment.
Whats more, Ive seen that Mr Hs arrears started following the rejection of a PPI claim. 
While I understand hes unhappy with this, this isnt a complaint about how MotoNovo 
recorded the arrears with the CRAs and is something Mr H will need to raise with the PPI 
provider. So, I wont be addressing this within my decision.
It's not disputed that MotoNovo incorrectly recorded the arrears on Mr Hs account with the 
CRAs, and that this has now been amended. So, Ive reviewed whats being recorded, 
based on the latest information I have available to me.
From what Ive seen, these are the payments Mr H was required to pay under the agreement 
he signed, what he actually paid, and what the resulting arrears situation was:

Mr H has provided an extract of his credit file, showing what MotoNovo are recording with an 
update date of 11 April 2021. From this, I can see that, for the period January 2020 to March 
2021, MotoNovo have recorded the arrears situation as follows:
Month Arrears 
(Months)Arrears on 
CRA
January 2020 0.00 0
February 2020 1.00 0
March 2020 2.00 0

March 2021 3.04 3
A further extract of Mr Hs credit report from September 2021 shows the same figures. 
Based on what Ive seen, Im not satisfied that MotoNovo are recording the arrears for Mr H 
correctly. When asked about this, MotoNovo said we are unable to say why there are jumps 
in the numbers. Our system will sometimes protect the credit file for a number of months of a 
deferral but then catch up the reporting when the deferral period ends, this is why it can 
jump in numbers. We cannot say for sure of this has happened on this occasion but is most 
likely the reason.
While I appreciate the comments from MotoNovo, this doesnt explain why the amount of 
arrears theyre recording doesnt match with the actual number of months Mr H was in 
arrears. Whats more, MotoNovo have an obligation to report correct information to the 
CRAs and reporting the wrong level of arrears while their system is catching up is not 
acceptable.
Because of this, I think MotoNovo need to do something to put things right.
Mr H has said that the incorrect reporting had an effect on him, as he was refused a mobile 
phone switch in June 2021 due to adverse information on his credit file. While I dont doubt 
this was the case, the credit search hes provided also shows he had mortgage arrears, of 
between 1 and 2 payments, going back to June 2015, and with continuous arrears from April 
2018. So, I cant say it was just the incorrect reporting from MotoNovo that affected Mr Hs 
ability to obtain credit.
However, I also need to take into consideration that this will be the third time that Mr H has 
complained about MotoNovo reporting his arrears incorrectly, and they continue to do so. 
Given this, I think MotoNovo should further compensate Mr H for the ongoing inconvenience 
this has caused him. 
So, my provisional decision is that MotoNovo should:
provide Mr H with a written statement, breaking down the amount hes paid every 
month since the start of the agreement, the amount that was due for each of these 
months, and the amount of any arrears, and the number of months these arrears 
equates to;
correct Mr Hs credit file so that the reported arrears correctly match those on the 
statement above, for each month the agreement has been live; and
pay Mr H an additional £100 to compensate him for the ongoing distress and 
inconvenience caused by the incorrect reporting.Responses
Neither Mr H nor MotoNovo had any comments on my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive had no comments on my provisional decision, and because neither party have 
provided any additional evidence, my view remains unaltered.
Putting things right
So, MotoNovo should:
provide Mr H with a written statement, breaking down the amount hes paid every 
month since the start of the agreement, the amount that was due for each of these 
months, and the amount of any arrears, and the number of months these arrears 
equates to;
correct Mr Hs credit file so that the reported arrears correctly match those on the 
statement above, for each month the agreement has been live; and
pay Mr H an additional £100 to compensate him for the ongoing distress and 
inconvenience caused by the incorrect reporting.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I uphold Mr Hs complaint. MotoNovo Finance Limited 
should follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2022.
