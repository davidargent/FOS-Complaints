K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc allowed a transaction  to debit his 
account wrongly, which left him in financial difficulties and without access to funds.
background
The background to this complaint, and my initial conclusions, were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 18 June  2019  a copy of which is attached and forms part of this final 
decision. 
In my provisional decision I explained  why I thought this complaint shouldnt be upheld. I 
invited both parties to send any additional evidence or comments they wished to make 
before I made my final decision.  
NatWest responded  setting out that it accepts my provisional decision. But it said that in the 
event that my provisional decision  is adopted  as my final decision it intended to remove  the 
temporary credit that it had placed on Mr Hs account in August 2018. It recommended that 
Mr H speak with H, the vehicle rental company  that debited money from his account, about 
any refund  that it may owe him if it hasnt yet refunded the payment it took. 
Mr H replied to my provisional decision with a number  of points. He said he believed  that 
both NatWest and H were responsible for what happened here. He stated that he didnt 
personally sign a rental  agreement with H covering hire for the vehicle about which this 
payment relates.  He also said he didnt give personal authorisation for H to use his debit 
card, which it held on file from previous business with him. And he said no invoice was ever 
presented to him by H. 
Mr H said after he challenged the payment H debited from his account it accepted that the 
final audit charge had been  applied in error. And he stated that, in his view,  NatWest needed 
encouragement from our service to refund the money that debited his account.  Mr H 
maintains that NatWest  shouldnt have allowed H to debit his account with the money  it 
requested. And he feels that in doing  so, NatWest caused him and his family financial 
hardship. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account Mr Hs 
additional comments and whether these  change my provisional decision. 
In my provisional decision I explained  that I wasnt considering the merits of the dispute 
between Mr H and H because this complaint  was brought against NatWest. I also outlined 
why I wasnt going  to address whether H was entitled to ask request the final audit charge 
from NatWest.  Mr H states  he didnt have a personal  rental  agreement  with H for the period 
of hire in question. But this really is a matter  Mr H will need to take up directly with H.
Mr H said he didnt authorise the charges H claimed  from his account. But, as I explained in 
my provisional decision, he had previously given H the details of the debit card that it used 
here. And in doing so, Mr H gave his consent  for NatWest to authorise  any final audit 
charges presented to it by H.
Ref: DRN46134192I remain satisfied that when NatWest authorised the payment request by H it acted in line 
with the terms and conditions of Mr Hs account.  And I remain  persuaded that NatWest 
would have viewed  the final audit charge as a legitimate request for payment, which Mr H 
had authorised. 
Theres no evidence to demonstrate that NatWest did anything wrong in authorising  the 
payment requested by H. It had no reason to decline it. And, as I outlined in my provisional 
decision, once  NatWest was made aware  that there was a problem with this payment I think  
it acted reasonably in doing what it could to try to assist Mr H in getting  his money back.  Im 
persuaded that the time NatWest took to reverse this payment was reasonable in the 
circumstances. I therefore  dont think that NatWest  has done anything  wrong towards  Mr H.
Mr H has said this error has caused his family to experience financial difficulties.  But as I 
stated in my provisional decision  Im satisfied NatWest correctly  authorised  this transaction.  
And on that basis, while I sympathise with Mr H for the situation in which  he found himself, I 
cant fairly conclude  that NatWest was responsible for the losses  he incurred. And I cant 
order it to pay compensation. 
So, while I would like to thank Mr H for his response to my provisional decision, Im not 
persuaded to change  my decision on the basis of what he has said here.  This means  that 
Im adopting  the reasoning set out in my provisional  decision as my final decision. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, my final decision is that I do 
not uphold Mr Hs complaint and do not ask National Westminster  Bank  Plc to do anything 
further. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.

complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster  Bank Plc allowed a transaction to debit his account  
wrongly, which left him in financial difficulties and without access to funds.
background
Mr H is a NatWest customer.  In June  2018  he ordered a new debit card to replace his previous  card, 
which Ill call card one. NatWest say card one was cancelled on 3 July 2018. But on 15 August 2018 a 
Ref: DRN46134193very large sum of money debited Mr Hs account after a car hire company, Ill call H, requested 
payment using the details of card one. 
Mr H contacted NatWest the same day to report this transaction and complain  about the payment 
debiting his account.  He said NatWest  shouldnt have authorised this payment  because his business 
had hired  the vehicle from H and he hadnt used card one during that transaction. He told NatWest 
that he had given H the details of card one previously but that was when he had hired a vehicle in a 
personal capacity.  So, he said he hadnt authorised  the payment it took here.  And he felt NatWest had 
made an error in allowing  this payment to be taken from his account, which  had left him in severe 
financial difficulties.
During Mr Hs telephone  call with NatWest it offered  to do a conference call with H. But Mr H declined 
this. So, NatWest told him to contact H to ask it to refund  him. And it said, if he couldnt  resolve 
matters with H, he would need to provide  information about  the transaction and attempts he had 
made to ask H to refund  him so it could,  essentially,  initiate a chargeback  claim on his behalf. In 
efforts to prevent  any further  payments being claimed by H NatWest changed  the status of card one 
from cancelled to stolen. 
Later the same day Mr H contacted  NatWest again. On this occasion NatWest told him the payment H 
had taken from his account was a final audit charge. But Mr H maintained that, while he had hired 
vehicles from H in the past,  he hadnt authorised  this transaction. So he didnt  think H was entitled to 
charge it. And he said NatWest told him it would refund the money H had debited from his account in 
view of this. 
On 21 August 2018, NatWest re-credited  the payment in question  to Mr Hs account.  But it said this 
was on the condition that Mr H provide it with the information it had requested  from him. NatWest said 
by mid September 2018  it still hadnt received the required  information from Mr H so it told him it 
planned to reverse the credit. 
By this point Mr H had already referred his complaint to our service. He told our investigator that, as a 
result of the money H claimed  from his account, he incurred overdraft charges  from NatWest.  He also 
said he was unable to pay utility bills and had to take time off work to care for his family  in the 
absence of a carer  as he could no longer afford their fee. 
After our investigator looked into Mr Hs complaint they thought  NatWest had made  an error 
authorising the transaction. So they upheld  Mr Hs complaint and thought  NatWest should pay Â£450 
compensation for the trouble  and upset its mistake caused. Mr H accepted our investigators view but 
NatWest disagreed. So this complaint was referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. My role here is to look at this complaint  impartially and, while Ive had 
regard to everything Mr H has said,  I also have  to be fair to NatWest too. With that in mind, Im 
departing from what our investigator has said in their view. Ill explain why.
The crux of this complaint is whether NatWest acted fairly and reasonably in allowing H to debit a 
payment from Mr Hs account using  the details of card one. This complaint is brought  against 
NatWest. So, in making my decision  Ive looked what NatWest  did and whether I think it made a 
mistake. Im not looking at the merits of the dispute between Mr H and H. This means Im not going  to 
address whether H was entitled to ask for the payment  in question,  which I understand is an issue Mr 
H is pursuing outside  of our service. 
Ill say at the outset that, based on what Ive seen, I dont think NatWest acted  unfairly or did anything 
wrong. I appreciate  Mr H will be disappointed by my decision and I recognise  how strongly he feels  
about whats happened. But Ill explain why I think NatWest was entitled to authorise the payment 
requested by H here.
Ref: DRN46134194The payment in question was a final audit charge imposed by H. H said this payment related to 
charges for returning a vehicle damaged  and late when it was hired  by Mr Hs business. Car hire 
agreements are subject to a final audit  charge.  And the terms of Mr Hs rental agreement with H 
clearly outline when its entitled  to submit a charge after a vehicle has been returned to recover the 
cost of an item not incurred at the time of billing.  Mr H wouldve agreed to those terms when he 
undertook business with H.
Mr H states he didnt  authorise the charges  H claimed from his account. But he had previously given  
the details of card one to H. in doing so, he authorised  H to debit the cost of hire. He also gave his 
authority for H to deduct a final audit charge in the event that additional charges  were  incurred which 
werent covered by the hire payment he had previously made. And, as a previous customer  of H, Mr H 
gave his consent for NatWest to authorise any final audit charges  presented to it by H. 
H claimed this payment  using the details of card one. Its clear that Mr H believes NatWest didnt 
cancel that card before  the payment debited his account.  He thinks that if NatWest had cancelled card 
one it wouldve prevented  H from debiting  his account.  So, he feels  NatWest made an error here. But 
Ill explain why I dont agree  with Mr H.
Ive seen evidence that NatWest cancelled  card one on 3 July 2018. This was over a month before 
the payment in question debited  Mr Hs account.  And even if NatWest hadnt cancelled card one, as 
Mr H thinks,  it wouldnt have prevented this payment  leaving his account. I say this because Mr Hs 
liability for a final audit  charge accrued  at the time he entered into his contract  with H. So NatWest 
would still have been entitled to allow  the disputed payment to go through under the authority Mr H 
had previously given H when he had hired the vehicle  in question. Cancelling a card wouldnt prevent 
a final audit charge debiting someones account.  Otherwise anyone could hire a vehicle using their 
debit card, cause damage to it and then cancel  their card to try to avoid paying for that damage. 
Mr H told our service  that this transaction relates to vehicle hire by his business. So he said the 
payment shouldnt  have been debited from his personal  account.  But as Ive already explained, Im 
not commenting on whether  H was entitled to take the payment it did from his personal  account 
because this is a matter Mr H will need to take up directly with H. 
At the time NatWest was asked to authorise the payment in question,  it couldnt have  been expected  
to know  whether H was supposed to use Mr Hs personal or business  card details  to claim  the 
payment it took. I understand  that the final audit charge  has now been waived by H. But NatWest 
couldnt be expected to know that, after it authorised payment from Mr Hs account, he would dispute 
the charge and that it would be subsequently waived.  
The terms  and conditions of Mr Hs account state  well always take payments that have been  
charged to your debit card from your account. Thats what it did here. To NatWest the final audit 
charge wouldve appeared to be a legitimate request for payment, which Mr H had authorised. So, Im 
satisfied NatWest didnt do anything wrong in authorising the payment requested by H. It had no 
reason to decline  it.
But once NatWest was made aware  by Mr H that there was a problem with this payment  it had a duty 
to help him reclaim the money that debited his account. So, with this in mind, Ive thought  about 
whether it did enough to assist here.
I can see that NatWest  tried to assist Mr H as soon as he reported  his transaction  as being 
unauthorised. I say this because it offered to look at the possibility  of arranging  an overdraft  and 
payment plan because this transaction  had caused Mr Hs account to go overdrawn. NatWest  said Mr 
H declined these offers. But I think this demonstrates NatWest was trying to help Mr H as far as it 
reasonably could.
NatWest also informed Mr H about  what he would need to do if he wanted it to raise a chargeback  
claim on his behalf. This is a process that allows customers to ask for a payment  to be reversed  if 
Ref: DRN46134195there's a problem with that transaction. This can include  a situation where  a car hire company claims 
a final audit charge that a customer disputes as being owed.  
Under the chargeback scheme the bank acts as the intermediary. Its role is to gather information  from 
a customer and submit this to the debit card provider. Its the customers responsibility  to contact the 
merchant first to request a refund. If that isnt unsuccessful a customer needs to provide the bank with 
information about the transaction and how theyve tried to resolve the matter with the merchant in 
question. This information is a requirement of the chargeback process. And its not unreasonable for a 
bank to place the onus of providing that information on the customer. 
Here, NatWest asked Mr H to contact H to see if it would  refund him as an initial  step. It also said that 
if he wanted to reclaim  the money  via chargeback he would need to provide correspondence  from H, 
its invoice, the rental agreement terms and conditions  together with proof of his attempts  to resolve  
matters so it could initiate a chargeback request  on his behalf. NatWest  was entitled to ask Mr H to 
provide the information it requested. And it wasnt unreasonable for it to do so for the reasons Ive 
already given. 
I can see that NatWest  refunded the money in question on 21 August 2018. This was 6 days  after the 
funds debited  Mr Hs account. He thinks NatWest shouldve re-credited that money  sooner. But I think 
the time NatWest  took to reverse  this payment  was reasonable. I say this because the terms of Mr Hs 
account state we may ask you for additional  information  to decide  whether  you should  be refunded. 
They also say well refund you (if weve asked you for additional information) within 10 business  
days of us receiving that information. 
Here NatWest had asked  Mr H to provide the information it thought  it needed in order to satisfy itself 
that the final audit charge  had been correctly requested by H. But it told our service  that, despite 
repeated requests, Mr H didnt provide his hire rental agreement  with H. NatWest  needed  to see Hs 
rental terms so it could decide whether H was entitled to claim the money  it had requested.  As this 
wasnt supplied by Mr H, NatWest had to obtain a copy from Hs website. I think this was proactive 
behaviour by NatWest. 
Notwithstanding the fact that Mr H didnt supply  the information NatWest had requested it reversed 
the payment within six days of the money leaving  his account. I think this demonstrates that NatWest 
tried to assist Mr H with his chargeback claim. I also think it shows that NatWest acted  fairly in 
agreeing to refund  the money H took from Mr Hs account while  it was still investigating whether H 
was entitled to claim that payment. Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest dealt with Mr Hs chargeback 
request correctly.
Mr H is unhappy NatWest later told him it planned to reverse the credit it had applied. But NatWest  
said when it re-credited  the payment to Mr Hs account it made clear to him that this was on the 
condition that he furnish it with the documentation and information it had requested. And more than 
three weeks after the money had been  returned to Mr H, NatWest said he still hadnt provided this 
information. With this in mind, I think it was reasonable  for NatWest  to tell Mr H it was intending to 
reverse the credit.
Mr H said he suffered severe financial difficulties as a result  of the funds H claimed from his account. 
But, while I realise  that must have been distressing and very frustrating to Mr H, Im satisfied NatWest 
correctly authorised this transaction.  It follows  that I cant fairly find that it was responsible for the 
losses Mr H sustained or order it to pay compensation to him. 
my provisional  decision
My decision  is that Im not minded to uphold this complaint. 
Ill wait two weeks to see if either party  has anything further to add  before considering my decision 
on this complaint once more.
