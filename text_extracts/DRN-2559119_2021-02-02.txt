The complaint
Mrs B has complained that MI Money Ltd, trading as TotallyMoney, allowed a third party to 
take out credit cards in her name.
What happened
On 26 April 2019, Mrs B checked her status with a credit reference agency, which she uses. 
She discovered that TotallyMoney had carried out a search of her file and provided a quote 
to a third party pretending to be her. The third party used the quote to open two credit card 
accounts in Mrs Bs name. Mrs B said she hadnt registered with TotallyMoney and she 
hadnt applied for the credit cards. She asked the banks to cancel the credit cards, which 
they did. She also contacted TotallyMoney.
TotallyMoney closed the account immediately. It told her a third party had registered for its 
services on 23 April 2019 and had opened an account in her name. The third party had also 
succeeded in obtaining a credit report from a credit reference agency, via TotallyMoney.
Mrs B was unhappy that TotallyMoney had allowed a fraudster to get information about her 
credit status, which, in turn, led to the credit card applications. She asked TotallyMoney to 
compensate her and to register her case with CIFAS.
TotallyMoney replied that it had done nothing wrong and refused to pay any compensation. It 
said: -
TotallyMoney is an online credit broker. It allows consumers to find the most 
appropriate financial products for their individual circumstances. It provides two 
services: eligibility checks for products and a free credit report.
Consumers register for its services by providing basic information  name, address 
and employment status. The third party provided this information.
TotallyMoney does not verify identity for the eligibility check because this is done by 
the lender when the consumer applies for credit.
The free credit report is provided by a credit reference agency. The agency carries 
out a knowledge-based assessment (KBA) by asking the consumer further questions 
about their finances. In this case, the third party was able to answer the KBA 
questions correctly. This suggested that the third party knew Mrs Bs personal and 
financial details. 
TotallyMoney does not carry out the KBA.
TotallyMoney also said that the credit card applications were not made from its website and 
so it wasnt responsible for those applications.
Lastly, TotallyMoney said it couldnt register her case with CIFAS because its not a member 
of that trade body.
Mrs B wasnt happy with TotallyMoneys decision, so she asked this service to investigate. 
She said shed made a subject access request and the documents showed that the third 
party had provided the wrong details for her. So, TotallyMoney shouldve known it was a 
fraudulent application.
An investigator looked into her complaint, but she didnt uphold it. She said the credit 
reference agency confirmed that it had carried out the verification checks before making the 
credit report available. It admitted that the third party had managed to get around its security 
system, although they had answered its questions correctly. The investigator concluded that 
this was nothing to do with TotallyMoney. And, as TotallyMoney is not a member of CIFAS, it 
couldnt register her case with it. 
Mrs B didnt accept our investigators view. She said TotallyMoney is responsible for what 
happened, and she wants:
ten years free credit monitoring and the cost of registering with CIFAS, which totals 
£125
£400 for the time she has spent on putting in place protective measures. 
A commitment to cover further additional losses up to £16,000.
This case has now come to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its upsetting to find out that someone has used your identity to get financial services or 
products. It makes us feel less safe. So, I do understand why Mrs B feels strongly that 
TotallyMoney shouldve done more to stop the fraud from happening.
I can see her point that, had TotallyMoney not accepted the registration, the fraudster 
wouldnt have got the credit report or applied for the credit card. However, as the credit 
broker, I consider that TotallyMoney acted proportionately given that it doesnt itself provide 
credit or credit reports. It simply provides an online platform for consumers to find suitable 
products. It expects that the lenders or the credit reference agencies will conduct further 
verification checks, before they provide their services. In this case, the credit reference 
agency admitted that the third party had answered their questions correctly, yet somehow 
still managed to get around its security. Its not clear if it carried out a full check of Mrs Bs 
address or length of employment. But that is a matter for the credit reference agency to 
investigate. Further questions might also be asked of the two banks which opened the 
accounts, but they swiftly closed the accounts and arent pursuing Mrs B for the debts.
So, I dont consider that TotallyMoney have done anything wrong. Besides, Mrs B hasnt 
suffered any financial loss, although she has been inconvenienced by what happened and 
no doubt upset by it. Even if I were to conclude that Totally Money were responsible, I 
wouldnt be asking it to pay the compensation which she has asked for, which appears 
totally disproportionate to her complaint.
Lastly, as TotallyMoney isnt a CIFAS member I cant ask it to register her case with it.
Im sorry this will be disappointing news for Mrs B, but I hope the reasons for my decision 
are clear.My final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
