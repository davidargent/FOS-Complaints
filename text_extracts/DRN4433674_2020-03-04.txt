K821x#15complaint
Miss M complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly  
lent to her. 
background
Between January 2015 and January  2017, Sunny lent Miss M 21 loans. Her full borrowing 
history is set out in the appendix  to this decision.  However, for ease of reference,  I have set 
out the first eight  loans below.

Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in relation to loans 6 to 21.  Sunny 
didnt agree with that view. Initially, it said it agreed  the complaint  should be upheld  in 
respect of loans 12 to 18. It then revised that offer to include loans 10 to 18. It didnt think  the 
complaint should  be upheld  in respect  of loans 19 to 21 because six months had elapsed 
between Miss M repaying loan 18 and taking out loan 19. 
Miss M didnt accept Sunnys offer of settlement, so the matter has been  passed to me to 
make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner.  There may even come  a point where the lending  
history and pattern  of lending itself clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN44336742the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
As Miss M hasnt  disputed what our adjudicator said about loans 1-5, I havent considered 
this borrowing any further. But I have kept these  loans  in mind when thinking about  Miss Ms 
overall borrowing  relationship with Sunny.
However, I have thought  carefully about what Sunny  said in respect  of loans 19 to 21. I 
appreciate there was a gap in the lending between loans 18 and 19. However, the sheer 
number of loans  Miss M had taken in the previous  15 months along with the fact that Miss M 
returned for a slightly larger loan leads  me to conclude  that I dont think  the length  of time 
between the borrowing itself is sufficient to break the chain of lending. On that basis,  I have  
considered all of Miss Ms borrowing to amount to one chain. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was a 
point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that stage was reached, Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt 
have agreed any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I agree with our adjudicator  that this 
point was reached by loan 6. I say this because  by now Sunny should have realised that 
Miss M was not managing  to sustainably repay  her loans. She had taken out six loans in four 
and a half months. But she had also applied to borrow more  than Sunny  agreed to lend her 
in respect of loans 1, 3 and 4. I think this (along  with her frequent  loan applications) should 
have put Sunny on notice that Miss M had an ongoing financial need and she was seeking to 
plug that gap with short-term lending.  
I can also see that Miss M applied for loan 6 within  a week  of repaying loan 5. Loan 6 was 
for the same amount  as the previous borrowing. It seems to me that Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ms indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. It should  have known that Miss M was most likely  borrowing  to 
meet an ongoing  need. 
Miss M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed. Loan  21 was taken  out two 
years after Miss Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. She had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN44336743So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 21. Sunny will need to take action to 
put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 6 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 21 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss 
M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 April 2020.
