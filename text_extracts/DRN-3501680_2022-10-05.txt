The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that First Holiday Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr and Mrs S say that they entered into a trial membership agreement with a holiday 
company in April 2009 which they paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with First 
Holiday Finance. They entered into an acquisition agreement for a holiday club membership 
with the holiday company in August 2009. They traded in their trial membership which was 
given a value of £5,795 and the purchase price of the membership under the acquisition 
agreement was £21,028. They entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday 
Finance in August 2009 for a loan to pay the amount due to the holiday company.
The loan was repaid in October 2010 but Mr and Mrs S traded in that membership and 
bought another holiday club membership in July 2013 which they paid for using a loan with 
another credit provider. That loan was repaid in July 2015 but Mr and Mrs Ss representative 
made a claim to First Holiday Finance under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 in May 2018 about the trial membership agreement and the August 2009 
acquisition agreement. 
First Holiday Finance provided a response from the holiday company in which it said, 
amongst other things, that the memberships hadnt been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S. 
Mr and Mrs S werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She said that Mr 
and Mrs S had six years from the time of the sales to make their misrepresentation claims so 
she thought that First Holiday Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of their section 75 
claims to turn them down. She also said that Mr and Mrs S had six years from when the 
credit agreements ended to make their unfair relationship claims so she thought that First 
Holiday Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of their section 140A claims to turn them 
down.
Mr and Mrs Ss representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendation in detail and 
says, in summary and amongst other things, that Mr and Mrs S first became aware that they 
had cause for complaint when they took legal advice in late 2015. It says that the terms of 
the agreements were unfair under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 
1999 and the holiday company didnt comply with the Timeshare Regulations. It has also 
provided a document entitled Generic submissions on behalf of complainants which sets 
out legal advice that has been obtained about the way that the holiday company sold the 
holiday club memberships. First Holiday Finance has also responded to our investigators 
recommendations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of, or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Ss complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claims that 
theyd made under sections 75 and 140A and I accept that their complaint was 
referred to this service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to their claims;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ss claims under sections 75 and 
140A in this decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering 
whether or not First Holiday Finances response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
Im not considering any issues relating to the holiday club membership that Mr and 
Mrs S bought in July 2013 as they paid for it using a loan with another credit provider 
so First Holiday Finance wouldnt have any liability to them for that purchase;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Ss claim under section 75 is that the trial membership and the 
membership that they bought in August 2009 were misrepresented to them and that 
they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First Holiday Finance would be 
expected to consider those claims unless the claims were brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case the claims would be time-barred;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs S could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the memberships soon after they entered into the acquisition agreement in 
August 2009 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations would have 
been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when they also 
entered into a loan agreement with First Holiday Finance;
I consider that Mr and Mrs Ss cause of action accrued in August 2009, so they would 
have had six years from then to bring any claim under section 75 against either the 
holiday company or First Holiday Finance  but a claim wasnt made to First Holiday 
Finance until May 2018, more than eight years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that their claim under section 75 is 
now time-barred;Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that Mr and Mrs S only became aware that they 
could make a claim to First Holiday Finance after they took legal advice in late 2015 - 
but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr 
and Mrs Ss claim;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
its my understanding that the fixed sum loan agreement that Mr and Mrs S used to 
pay for the trial membership ended when they took out the loan to pay the amount 
due to the holiday company in August 2009  and that loan was repaid in October 
2010;
I consider that Mr and Mrs S would have needed to have made a claim against First 
Holiday Finance within six years of October 2010  but their claim wasnt made to 
First Holiday Finance until May 2018, more than seven years later which was outside 
of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that their claim under 
section 140A is now also time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that no assessment of Mr and Mrs Ss 
creditworthiness was made before First Holiday Finance made the loans to them  
but the loan that was made to them in August 2009 was repaid in October 2010 and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for them at the time 
that it was made to them and nor have I seen any evidence to show that they 
complained to First Holiday Finance about the affordability of the loans or the credit 
checks that it conducted before their representative made claims to it in May 2018 so 
I consider that any complaint about the credit checks that were conducted would now 
also be time-barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any laws or regulations for which First Holiday Finance would be liable in these 
circumstances;
First Holiday Finance issued a response to Mr and Mrs Ss claims in August 2018 - I 
consider that it should have said that their claims were time-barred so I cant say that 
its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  but I consider that if it had 
properly considered their claims it would have said that they were time-barred under 
the Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs S for the issues that theyve had with their 
memberships and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require First Holiday Finance 
to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid under the loan agreements, to 
pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 2 November 2022.
