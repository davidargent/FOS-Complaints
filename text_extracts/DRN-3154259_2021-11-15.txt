The complaint
Mrs K complains PayPal (Europe) S. r.l. & Cie, S.C.A. (PayPal) failed to help her obtain a 
refund over a disputed transaction.
What happened
Mrs K says she purchased goods via an online auction website in November 2020, by using 
her PayPal account, but was unhappy with the goods and returned them to the seller. Mrs K 
says the seller agreed to refund her in February 2021, but this didnt happen. Mrs K says she 
continued to attempt to obtain a refund from both the online auction business and the seller 
but had no success. Eventually Mrs K contacted PayPal by which time she had closed and 
reopened her account with them, but PayPal were unable to initially locate the purchase 
payment and then advised her she was outside their timeframe for buyer protection and 
couldnt help her.
PayPal says Mrs K chose to close her account with them and in any event by the time she 
contacted them about the issue in June 2021, she was outside the buyer protection time 
frame, so they were unable to help her. PayPal says they have done nothing wrong. 
Mrs K wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mrs Ks complaint. The 
investigator felt that while Mrs K was outside the buyer protection timescale offered by 
PayPal, as she had returned the item to the seller it wasnt fair, she hadnt received a refund 
for this. The investigator proposed PayPal issue a refund for the full amount she had paid for 
the goods. 
PayPal didnt agree with the investigator and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said :
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to that of the investigator and I will 
explain how I have come to my decision. 
I can see that it would have been frustrating and upsetting for Mrs K having returned the 
goods she had purchased and then not to receive the refund she was expecting.  
When looking at this complaint, I will consider if PayPal have acted unreasonably by not 
refunding Mrs K for the goods she purchased and returned to the seller. 
Mrs K and PayPal have provided this service with various information regarding this matter 
and I have taken this into account when coming to a full and impartial decision here. 
Mrs K says she purchased the goods via an online auction website and paid for those goods 
via her PayPal account on 27 November 2020, and from the information I have seen, I am 
satisfied that is what happened here. Furthermore, Mrs K has provided this service with 
screenshots of online conversations with both the seller and PayPal. While there is evidence 
from those screenshots, to suggest the goods were returned to the seller, what isnt clear is 
if the seller ever refunded Mrs Ks PayPal account, as they seem to have promised in 
February 2021. Mrs K closed her original PayPal account shortly after the original purchase 
in November 2020, so I am satisfied that would have added to the issues PayPal had in 
locating the initial payment or any refund from the seller. That said from what I can see, 
there is no evidence from the seller to show a refund was made, so I cant say that ever 
happened. PayPal have said they have no record of the refund being made to Mrs Ks 
present or former account with them. 
What is important here are the timescales, as under the terms of Mrs Ks PayPal agreement, 
she would have 180 days to open a dispute with them from the date of the purchase of the 
goods. PayPal make the point that as the purchase of the goods took place on the 27 
November 2020, which I have seen evidence of, this would mean the transaction was 
outside the buyers protection period of 180 days, given Mrs K didnt raise the issue with 
them until 12 June 2021.  
While Mrs K has suggested she had difficulties trying to get through to PayPal during this 
time and attempted to contact them within the 180-day period, I can see no evidence to 
support that. What I have seen is a copy of an email from Mrs K to the seller dated 10 June 
2021, asking for the refund from them and with that in mind it wouldnt appear she had yet 
begun the dispute process with PayPal until after that date. This would tie in with PayPals 
claim the first contact they had from Mrs K over this matter was 12 June 2021. As the 
investigator pointed out, this was two weeks outside of the timescale allowed for this to fall 
within PayPals buyer protection. 
While I can understand it seems unfair that Mrs K has returned the goods and not received a 
refund for that, I cant say that PayPal are at fault here, I say this as the dispute wasnt 
brought to PayPal within the permitted timescales of her agreement with them. 
Although Mrs K will be disappointed with my decision, I dont propose to ask anymore of 
PayPal here. 
Neither Mrs K or PayPal responded to my provisional decision, so the case has been passed 
back to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I gave both Mrs K and PayPal until 11 November 2021 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision, but as I have heard nothing further from either I see no need to change or add to 
this and so my final decision remains the same. 
My final decisionMy final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2021.
