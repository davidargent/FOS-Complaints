The complaint
Mr W complains that Bank of Scotland plc, trading as Halifax, wont refund to him the money 
that he paid for a computer system. 
What happened
Mr W paid £429.99 to a retailer from his Halifax bank account for a computer system in 
November 2020. He didnt receive it so he contacted the supplier and cancelled the order 
but it then said that the computer system had been delivered. Mr W complained to Halifax 
that he hadnt received the computer system but it said that the merchant had provided 
evidence to show that it had been delivered and left in a safe place as requested by Mr W 
so it was unable to challenge the claim any further. Mr W wasnt satisfied with its response 
so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that Mr W 
had contacted Halifax because the goods werent received so a chargeback claim was made 
on that basis but the merchant provided evidence to show that the goods were delivered. 
She said that Mr W also cancelled his order but hadnt provided evidence of that to Halifax 
and it was only able to make one chargeback claim for a transaction. She concluded that 
she couldnt reasonably say that Halifax had acted unfairly when handling Mr Ws dispute.
Mr W has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the safe 
place related to a different order and that he wouldnt have asked for a £430 item to be left 
near a bin on a busy road and its the delivery drivers fault that it was left there. Hes also 
provided a screenshot showing that the order had been cancelled and he says that he e-
mailed that evidence to Halifax. Our investigator said that Mr W hadnt used the correct e-
mail address but he says that he was given the e-mail address by Halifax during a phone 
call, he read it back to ensure that it was correct and he was given the wrong e-mail address.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made; 
Halifax made a chargeback claim because Mr W said that the goods hadnt been 
received  but the merchant provided evidence to show that the computer system 
had been delivered and left in a safe place as requested by Mr W so it was unable to 
challenge the claim any further;
I consider that Halifax acted correctly by making a chargeback claim but it was 
defended by the merchant and I consider that it was reasonable for it to conclude that 
there was then no reasonable prospect of the claim being successful;
Mr W says that he provided evidence to Halifax that the order had been cancelled - 
but the e-mail address to which Mr W sent it was incorrect so it didnt receive that 
evidence  although he says that he was given that e-mail address by Halifax Im not 
persuaded that its likely that Halifax would have given him an incorrect e-mail 
address;
the evidence that he provided was a screenshot from the merchant showing that the 
order had been cancelled and it included a cancellation number - but I consider it to 
be more likely than not that he was given incorrect information at that time by the 
merchant because the merchant has provided evidence to show that the delivery 
company received the computer system the day before Mr W says that his order was 
cancelled and that it was delivered to him at 10.40am on the day that he contacted 
the merchant;
I dont consider that Halifax had received evidence to show that the order had been 
cancelled so I dont consider that it acted incorrectly in not making a chargeback 
claim on that basis;
but even if a chargeback claim had been made on the basis that the order had been 
cancelled, I consider it to be more likely than not that the merchant would have 
contested the chargeback claim because the computer system had been delivered to 
Mr W and that there would have been no reasonable prospect of it being successful;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Mr W had provided details of a safe place 
but he says that it related to a different order  I consider that to be an issue between 
him and either the merchant or the delivery company (and I can see that hes been in 
contact with both of them about the computer system) and Im not persuaded that the 
use of the safe place is enough to show that Halifax should have dealt with his 
chargeback claim any differently;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Halifax has acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr W for the loss that hes suffered and the difficulties that hes 
experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Halifax 
to refund to Mr W the payment that he made for the computer system, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2022.
