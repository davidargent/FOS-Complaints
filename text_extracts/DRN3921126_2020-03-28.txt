Mr S complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.

* Loan one was a running credit facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans that 
Mr S took afterwards. 
The RCF allows a consumer to either request  funds  up to their agreed  credit limit in one go 
or take multiple  drawdowns up to their limit. Each drawdown could be repaid via five monthly 
instalments. Mr S initially  had a credit limit of £150  although later his overall limit appears  to 
have increased, from what Sunny has told us, by a further £150. 
In our latest  assessment an adjudicator didnt think it was wrong to have granted the RCF.  
But he thought  after eight drawdowns  in eight months, that it was likely  Mr S had become 
reliant on the RCF drawdown facility and was struggling to make  repayments without 
borrowing again. So, he said Sunny shouldnt have allowed  any drawdowns on the RCF 
from 18 June 2014. This adjudicator also thought loans 2 to 11 shouldnt have been given. 
Sunny disagreed. However, it accepted that something may have gone wrong when it 
provided loans  8 to 12, so it agreed to refund interest on these loans together  with 8% 
simple interest. It also agreed to update  the credit file in line with the adjudicators 
recommendation.
Mr S hasnt accepted  Sunnys offer. As no agreement could be reached,  the case has been 
passed to me for a final decision.
 
Ref: DRN39211262My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Mr S appears to have  accepted the latest  adjudicators findings and Sunny has only 
disagreed with what the second adjudicator has said about the lending  from 18 June 2014 
(when Mr S took his eighth drawdown under the RCF) until 14 February  2015  (loan  7). It 
seems therefore that the other  lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think  that I need  to 
make a finding about it. 
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted the 
RCFs drawdowns from 18 June 2014  and instalment loans 2 to 7. But I have kept the other  
lending in mind  when thinking  about  the overall lending relationship between Sunny  and 
Mr S. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute Sunny had to assess Mr Ss situation to check  if he 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do 
this in a way which was proportionate  to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks  could have 
taken into account  a number of different things,  such as how much was being  lent, the size 
of the repayments  and Mr Ss income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr S. These  factors include:
Mr S having a low income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans  over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr S.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr S was able to repay his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ref: DRN39211263There was also an expectation  in June 2014, when the eighth drawdown under the RCF was 
granted, that Sunny would review and monitor how Mr S was using  the RCF facility. CONC 
6.7.2 says A firm must monitor a customers repayment record  and take appropriate action 
where there  are signs of actual or possible repayment difficulties. So it wasnt enough for 
Sunny to just assess the further lending  based  on what it knew when the RCF had initially  
been approved  in June  2014. It also needed  to monitor how Mr S was using the facility - and 
then step in and provide help when or if it could see Mr S was or was likely having  financial 
difficulties.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
I can see that Mr S initially had a credit  limit under the RCF of £150  and took the full amount  
in September  2014. He then repaid slightly more than the contractual repayment  and the 
following month drew down on the RCF again  to around the maximum limit. He then repaid 
the outstanding balance  in full before drawing down £75 on 11 December 2014 and £50
on 18 December 2014. Mr S then made two regular payments before he borrowed  a further 
£44.11 taking his balance  towards his credit  limit. He then made further payments and 
following drawdowns of £75 and £88.75, he appears to have been back up to the RCFs 
credit limit on 17 May 2014. 
By 14 June  2014,  when  Mr S borrowed a further  £44.11 (again taking his debt to around his 
credit limit) hed used  his account in a similar way on eight occasions. I think Sunny  should 
have been aware  by this point that he wasnt  using his account as intended or making any 
headway in repaying his loan. After  all, by this point  Mr S had been  using  the facility  for 
nearly nine months.   
Indeed, what appears  to have happened is that Mr S was needing to borrow further from 
Sunny in order to fill a hole in his finances  that was made by making repayments to Sunny. 
And so this isnt a sustainable form of borrowing.
In these circumstances, I dont think Sunny could have reasonably believed that Mr S would 
have been able to repay  drawdowns  on the RCF from 18 June 2014 or any further loans  
without undue difficulty or without the need to borrow again. So I dont  think  Sunny shouldve 
allowed any further  drawdowns from this date. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, to see if there 
was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And I agree with our adjudicator  that Sunny should 
have realised this at the time it provided  loan 3. I say this because:
By loan 3 Mr S had been indebted to Sunny for around 16 months.  In my view,
Mr Ss loan history up until this point was a clear indication that his underlying 
financial situation didnt seem to be improving; 
Mr S took some loans  shortly after having repaid previous ones. For example, loan 2 
was taken just over two weeks  after full repayment of the RCF and loan 5 was taken 
within a week of repaying loans 2, 3 and 4. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr S, on these occasions,  was having to borrow further to cover  
the hole the repayment of his previous loans had left in his finances  and that this was 
indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
Ref: DRN39211264Mr S was borrowing  broadly similar  amounts. His instalment loans ranged between  
£100 and £200,  with over half of the loans being for £100. I think its most likely the 
relative consistency of the borrowing over the period showed  that Mr S didnt just 
have a short-term  cash-flow  problem,     
Mr Ss lending  history was prolonged. Loan 12 was provided over two years after his 
first loan.  And loans  11 and 12 were also higher than most of the previous instalment 
loans, suggesting  his situation  may even have deteriorated. The amount of time that 
Mr S spent  indebted  to Sunny meant that hed paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out when Sunny provided  loans  3 to 12 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ss
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about  his borrowing from 14 June 2014  onwards and 
Sunny should  put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on drawdowns on the RCF from 18 June 
2014 as well as all interest, fees and charges applied to loans 2 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about the RCF from 18 June 2014 and under loan 2 
from Mr Ss credit  file;
remove loans 3 to 12 from Mr Ss credit file entirely, this is because  the period of time 
Mr S owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax it has taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN39211265My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ss complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2020..
