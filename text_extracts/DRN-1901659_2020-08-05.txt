The complaint
Miss S complains that NewDay Ltd irresponsibly allowed her to open a credit card account 
that was unaffordable.
What happened
Miss S says she opened the account in 2016 but says NewDay didn't carry out sufficient 
checks on her income and outgoings. She says she was unemployed at the time and had 
other credit that should have been considered. Miss S says she would like interest and 
charges refunded and any averse data removed from her credit file.  And says it ought to 
have been clear to NewDay that the lending was unaffordable and so irresponsible.
NewDay says it carried out appropriate checks and says Miss S told it she was working. It 
says she didn't have any record of arrears or defaults on her credit file and says it tried to 
help Miss S when she told it about financial difficulties in March 2017. NewDay says it gave 
Miss S a relatively low credit limit of £300 and says in any event it doesn't matter if Miss S 
was in employment or not.
Miss S brought her complaint to is but our investigator didn't uphold it. The investigator 
thought NewDay had carried out appropriate and proportionate checks before approving 
Miss S's application. The investigator also thought Miss S didn't appear to have any adverse 
information recorded on her credit file and that the credit limit of £300 was relatively modest. 
The investigator thought any charges or interest were applied in line with the account terms 
and conditions
Miss S doesn't accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the 
overall view that NewDay has not acted unfairly or lent irresponsibly.
I have looked at NewDays records and can see that Miss S told it she was earning about 
£12,000 and in part-time work. I'm satisfied that NewDay carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks on Miss S's application and that she didn't have any adverse data 
recorded on her credit file such as a default or accounts in arrears. I think the credit offer of 
£300 was relatively low and I'm satisfied that appropriate checks were carried out. I also 
think that Miss S ought to have provided accurate information and don't think for a relatively 
low credit amount that NewDay ought to have carried out a more detailed credit assessment.
I can see that Miss S used her account but it was some months later that she told 
NewDay about her financial difficulties. I think on balance that suggests the lending was 
affordable at the time the credit card account was opened in September 2016.
I'm satisfied Miss S agreed to the account terms and conditions when the account was first opened. And I'm also satisfied that NewDay was entitled to make charges and charge 
interest where for example there was a late payment or missed payment. So I don't think 
NewDay made a mistake in applying interest or making charges in these circumstances and 
it follows that I can't fairly order NewDay to refund them.
Lenders should treat its customers positively and sympathetically when in financial 
difficulties. I think NewDay acted in such a way here and can see that it agreed a repayment 
plan with Miss S and provided her with details of organisations that could have helped her.
Overall I'm satisfied the lending in this complaint was not irresponsible. It was for a relatively 
small amount for which proportionate checks were carried out.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 September 2020.
