The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA reinstated his credit account after he 
repaid the outstanding balance via a debt management plan.
What happened
Mr C opened a credit account with PayPal in 2016. In early 2019 the account fell into arrears 
and in May 2019 Mr C entered into a debt management plan (DMP) via an organisation Ill 
refer to as S. Mr C made payments via the DMP which was recorded by PayPal on his credit 
file until May 2020. Payments continued to be received by PayPal until the balance was 
cleared in full in March 2022. 
In April 2022 Mr C contacted PayPal and asked it to reinstate his credit facility. PayPal says 
that because the account was up to date, it was reactivated following Mr Cs request. 
Mr C went on to use his credit facility again and built up an outstanding balance. But 
because of arrears that accrued, the account was closed in December 2022 and a default 
was reported on Mr Cs credit file. 
Mr C raised a complaint and said PayPal had acted unfairly by recording the default on his 
credit file. PayPal didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Cs complaint and ultimately upheld it. Mr C 
supplied copies of his correspondence with S to show hed entered into a DMP which 
included his PayPal account. Mr C added that by allowing him to access credit again, PayPal 
had let him borrow funds despite knowing hed previously had significant difficulties repaying 
them. The investigator said PayPal should remove the default its reported and agree a 
suitable repayment plan.
PayPal asked to appeal and said Mr C had repaid the balance in full in March 2022 so it was 
only fair for access to his account to be returned. As PayPal asked to appeal, Mr Cs 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In its response, PayPal says it was fair to restore access to Mr Cs account after he repaid 
the outstanding balance in March 2022. But Im not persuaded that tells the full story. Mr Cs 
balance was repaid on the basis of reduced payments he made via a DMP over an extended 
period. PayPal was aware Mr Cs account had been in arrears and subject to a DMP going 
back to 2019. Account access was removed on the basis of how Mr Cs payments had been 
made and the DMP he entered into. Im not persuaded it was fair for PayPal to simply wait 
for the balance to be repaid before providing access to Mr Cs account again without being 
sure he could afford to sustainably make repayments. 
Given the circumstances under which Mr C made repayments under a DMP to the balance 
from 2019, Id have expected PayPal to be very sure he could afford to borrow before 
making credit available again. But no evidence has been supplied that shows PayPal carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure Mr C could afford to sustainably repay 
any new debt he built up. If PayPal had looked at Mr Cs circumstances more closely before 
agreeing to reinstate his account and lend further funds I think it wouldve declined to 
proceed. Im not persuaded that PayPal treated Mr C fairly when it reinstated access to his 
account and allowed him to build further borrowing. 
The investigator upheld Mr Cs complaint and originally asked PayPal to remove the default 
from his credit file and agree a payment plan. But the investigator recently contacted both 
parties to explain the settlement should be revised as follows: 
- PayPal to refund all interest, fees and charges applied to Mr Cs account from April 
2022 onwards
- If by reworking the account there is a credit balance due to Mr C, PayPal should 
refund the difference to him as if they were overpayments and pay 8% simple interest 
from the date made to the date of settlement
- If by reworking Mr Cs account an outstanding balance remains, PayPal should 
contact Mr C with a view to clearing the outstanding balance by way of an affordable 
repayment plan
- Once Mr C has repaid the balance in full, PayPal will be obliged to remove all 
adverse information recorded on his credit file (including all arrears and the default) 
from April 2022 and mark the debt as settled
Ive considered all the available evidence and information. In my view, the above settlement 
is a fair and reasonable way to resolve Mr Cs complaint. So, Im going to proceed on that 
basis and uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
settle in line with the above guidance. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
