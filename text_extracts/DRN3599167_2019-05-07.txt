K820x#14complaint
Mr L has complained  that U K Insurance Limited didnt give details of how to pay a balance it
says he owed on cancellation of his car insurance policy.  Mr L disagrees with the amount
UKI said he owed.
background
Mr L bought a car insurance policy with UKI in October 2017. He sold his car and asked UKI
to suspend his policy as he intended  to buy a replacement car and insure it under this policy.
UKI suspended Mr Ls policy on 13 April 2018.  It told him it would continue to collect  the
monthly premium under  the policy. It told Mr L that if his policy  was suspended for more  than
28 days he would be entitled to a refund for any time on cover   but for any time less than 28
days, he would not.
On 4 May 2018  Mr L cancelled his policy with UKI. UKI told him it would charge a 
cancellation fee of £53.76.
Mr L complained to UKI. In summary  he said:
The difference in price  he found  online compared to the price UKI quoted him on
the phone  to add a replacement car to his policy was over £100  a month.
UKI didnt explain  its cancellation process.
The amount  UKI said Mr L owed  on cancellation  was incorrect.
It closed his complaint  when  it hadnt  resolved it.
It failed to reply or acknowledge  emails he sent to complain.
UKI refused to give his bank its details to allow Mr L to make a direct  payment for
the balance UKI said he owed.
UKI accepted that it had failed to deal with Mr Ls emails. And it said its agent  could have 
been clearer when  closing the complaint over the phone - As Mr L explained that he 
expected a follow up to the points he raised. UKI apologised and paid Mr L £50 
compensation for its poor service.
UKI said its rates change  on a daily basis - and this affects the price it quotes.  It said the
way it rates  its policies  is classed as business  sensitive information  and isnt something it
shares.
UKI said the amount it said Mr L owed on cancellation was correct.
Mr L didnt agree. He told us he paid costs of over £10 to make a postal order payment to
UKI because  it wouldnt  provide his bank with details of how to make  a direct  payment.
As Mr L didnt agree  he owed the full amount UKI said he did on cancellation, he paid an
amount he believed was correct. This meant Mr L owed  a balance payment of £50 to UKI.
As Mr L refused to pay the remaining balance, UKI passed the sum to a debt recovery
agent.
Mr L explained to our investigator  in July 2018  that he wanted us to look at the balance UKI
said he owed on cancellation. He said he cancelled his policy on 4 May 2018. But he
believed UKI charged him for a full month of cover. He believed UKI should only charge him
for days on cover minus  a cancellation fee of around  £35.
Ref: DRN35991672In September  2018 our investigator  gave her view.  She thought the balance  UKI said Mr L
owed on cancellation  was correct. So she believed UKI was entitled to ask Mr L to pay the
remaining balance of £50. She explained that the processes UKI has in place to run its
business isnt something our service has any authority over.  So we couldnt ask UKI to
reimburse Mr L for the fees he paid when  he sent a postal order payment by post.
Mr L raised a new complaint about his No Claims Bonus. Our investigator explained that she
would ask UKI to deal with this as a new complaint.
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators  findings.  He said UKI should provide the necessary 
details to enable  a customer to pay it if it says the customer owes  it money.  The burden to 
do that doesnt fall on the customer. As UKI refused  to provide his bank with details to 
enable him to make a direct payment, Mr L believes UKI owe him the costs he paid to send 
a payment by post. These costs came to £10.46.
I issued a provisional decision on 14 March 2019. I thought Mr Ls complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for different reasons.  I thought  Mr L correctly  owed  UKI a balance  of £50 on 
cancellation. But in February 2019  UKI waived this balance.  I thought  UKI hadnt  shown  that 
it have given Mr L the option to pay the balance it owed  without cost to himself. But the 
total amount I thought UKI should reimburse  Mr L for was less than the £50 balance it 
waived, so I didnt  think it needed to do any more.  
UKI accepted my provisional decision. Mr L said he was working  away  and following his 
return  intended  to reply  by 24 April 2019.  As Mr L hasnt provided any further comments, 
the case has been returned  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As I havent received any new information  
since sending my provisional decision,  my final decision is along the same lines. 
Mr L bought his car insurance policy on 17 October  2017. He asked UKI to suspend his
policy on 13 April 2018. On 4 May 2018 Mr L asked UKI to cancel  his policy. He hadnt
bought a replacement car and was working  away - so it would be some time before he
would look for a replacement.
UKI has provided a recording  of this call. The agent  told Mr L the cancellation fee would be
£53.76.
Its provided a breakdown  of the amount it says Mr L owed it when it cancelled  his policy on 
4 May 2018.  For the 199 days of cover, it says Mr L owed £794.93. This included a 
Guarantee Hire Car (GHC) premium  of £11.20. Adding the cancellation  fee of £53.76,  UKI 
said Mr L owed a total of £848.69.
As Mr L had paid UKI £798.69 - including the postal order  payment Mr L sent of £83.69 -
UKI said Mr L owed a remaining balance of £50.
Mr Ls policy says that - provided  no claim has been made - it will provide a pro rata refund
of the premium he paid for GHC if he cancels his policy.  So I think  UKI should have provided
a refund of £5.09. 
Ref: DRN35991673This is £11.20/365  multiplied by the number of days remaining under the
policy (365-199= 166).
Mr Ls policy says UKI will charge an administration fee as set out in his schedule if he
cancels his policy after 14 days.  And as UKI also confirmed the cancellation fee it would
charge in the call with Mr L on 4 May 2018, I think UKI was entitled to charge a cancellation
fee of £53.76.
So I think UKI correctly charged Mr L for the days of cover from 17 October 2017 to 4 May
2018 - and its cancellation fee of £53.76. But I think UKI should have reduced the amount it
said Mr L owed to reflect the pro rata refund for the GHC premium by £5.09. This is in line
with the policy.
In February 2019  UKI told us it has written  off the balance it said Mr L owed it of £50.
Mr L wants UKI to reimburse him for the £10.46 he paid in costs  to arrange and post a postal
order payment in June  2018. He says a deputy  manager at his bank called UKI on 13 June
2018 and asked for its bank details so that it could arrange a direct bank transfer - but UKI
refused to provide the details.
Usually an insurer-when asking for payment-will provide a customer with details and
options of how to pay. We asked UKI a number of times to provide  a copy  of the letters  it
sent to Mr L. But it hasnt provided  any. So in its absence, I think  it would  be fair and
reasonable for UKI to reimburse Mr L for the costs  he paid to make  payment by post. UKI
hasnt shown me that Mr L had alternative options - free of charge - to pay the balance  it
asked him for.
However - as I believe Mr L correctly owed  the full balance UKI asked him to pay - and it
has since waived the balance of £50 - I think Mr L hasnt  suffered a loss. I say this because
the pro rata refund of £5.09  and the £10.46 payment and postal  costs  leave a difference  of
£34.45 in Mr Ls favour. So I think  this is a fair outcome and I dont think UKI needs to do any
more.
Ref: DRN35991674my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2019.
