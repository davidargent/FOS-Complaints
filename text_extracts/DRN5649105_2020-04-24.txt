K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr L says he struggled  with the repayments and had to borrow  more to pay back 
existing loans. He got into a cycle  of debt and is now in a debt management plan.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. They thought Mr L was becoming persistently reliant 
upon short-term  lending and that all information about them was adverse and should  be 
removed from Mr Ls credit  file. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer redress for the lending from loan 13 onwards. We put this offer 
to Mr L, but he didnt want to accept  it.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN56491052Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr L didnt comment on the adjudicators  opinion  that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr L had with Sunny. So, it is something  I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.  After doing so Ive decided  to uphold 
the complaint  in part. Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Ref: DRN56491053Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, like the adjudicator, I think  that this point 
was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr L had taken out six loans in just over eight months.  So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ls 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ls first loan was for £700  and loan six was for £600, so it wasnt  significantly 
decreasing.  At this point Sunny ought  to have known that Mr L was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
And this is something mentioned by Mr L when he complained so I think this is most 
to have been the case.
Mr L was provided with more borrowing when previous  loans were  still to be repaid 
which could be an indication that he was struggling with his finances.  And 
Mr L was repaying his loans well before the agreed term. I appreciate this would 
have saved him interest charges,  but he was regularly returning  for further  borrowing  
and bearing in mind  the nature of short-term loans I would question  why someone 
would repay  a loan early  just to return for more borrowing shortly afterwards. 
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 15 was 
taken out nearly three years after Mr Ls first. Mr L had paid large amounts of interest  
to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ls ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about six to 15 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do 
If the outstanding balance  due on loan 15 has been transferred to a third party Sunny 
should buy the loan back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loan back, then it needs to work 
with the third party to make sure the following  is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr L which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
Ref: DRN56491054C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr L as though  they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results  in Mr L having  made overpayments then Sunny should  refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If this 
results in a surplus,  then the surplus should  be paid to Mr L. However, if there is still 
an outstanding  balance then Sunny should  try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Mr L. 
E) The number of loans  taken from six onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans six to 13 should  be removed from 
Mr Ls credit  file. Sunny does not have to remove loan 15 from Mr Ls credit file until 
this has been  repaid,  but any adverse information recorded about this loan should 
still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2020.
