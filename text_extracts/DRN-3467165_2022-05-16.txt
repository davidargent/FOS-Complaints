The complaint
Mr B complains about Aviva Insurance Limiteds refusal to cover a claim under his private 
medical insurance policy for treatment. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B took out the policy with reduced outpatient cover. That meant he didnt have 
cover for: - consultations, non-surgical treatment, diagnostic tests, specialist referred 
treatment (by a physiotherapist, chiropractor or osteopath), or mental health 
treatment.
The policy makes it clear that the £0 outpatient limit doesnt apply to outpatient 
cancer treatment. Though it does still apply to consequences of cancer treatment and 
conditions related to cancer treatment. 
Aviva covered Mr Bs cancer treatment. However, he then developed chronic urinary 
retention. Im satisfied the medical evidence supports that this was related to his 
cancer treatment, and therefore it was appropriate for Aviva to say that the £0 
outpatient limit applied to this.
Aviva reminded Mr B at the outset of his reduced outpatient cover, and explained this 
would only be lifted for active cancer treatment. Im satisfied that Mr Bs claim for 
treatment/management of his chronic urinary retention wouldnt be considered 
cancer treatment.
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2022.
