The complaint
Ms M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) only paid her half the 
compensation from mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) on loans she took out 
jointly with the late Mr M. NatWest used the other half to reduce the balance on the 
outstanding loan.
    
What happened
Ms M and the estate of Mr M complained to NatWest about the sale of PPI.
In March 2020 NatWest agree to uphold the complaints. But NatWest said there was an 
outstanding balance on the remaining loan. So it used Ms Ms half of the compensation to 
reduce the outstanding balance.
Ms M asked this service to step in. An adjudicator from this service thought NatWests offer 
was fair. And they thought it was fair for NatWest to use Ms Ms portion of the redress to 
reduce the outstanding balance of the loan.
Ms M disagreed with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to me for a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive first looked at the way NatWest has calculated the compensation. Where PPI has been 
mis-sold Id expect the business to return all the premiums paid by the consumers together 
with any interest and charges caused by the PPI. Id then expect the business to add 
compensatory interest calculated at 8% simple for all the time the consumer has been out of 
pocket.
Looking at the calculations supplied by NatWest I can see it has calculated the redress in the 
way Id expect it to.
Ms M has said there is no outstanding arrears on the loan. But NatWest has shown us 
evidence that loan ending 1285 had an outstanding balance of just over £22,000 in July 
2020. And I can see NatWest used Ms Ms half of the redress, £3,726.08, to reduce the 
outstanding balance.
Generally this service  would consider it fair for a business to set off the compensation 
payable for the mis-sale of a PPI policy against a consumers arrears on their account  and 
remove or reduce those arrears. In this case Ms M owed NatWest an amount outstanding on 
the loan, and NatWest owed Ms M a smaller amount in compensation for the mis-sold PPI. 
So I dont think it would be fair for me to direct NatWest to pay Ms M the PPI compensation 
when she owes NatWest a larger amount. 
When Ms M and Mr M took out the loan they did so jointly. So they were jointly and severally 
liable for the debt. When Mr M sadly passed, the outstanding loan balance became solely 
the responsibility of Ms M.
As the loan was taken out in joint names both Ms M and the estate of Mr M were entitled to a 
50% share of any compensation for the mis-sold PPI. But only Ms M now has a debt with 
NatWest. Mr Ms estate has no debt with NatWest. It follows that NatWest could not use     
Mr Ms share of the compensation to offset against the debt, so it paid his share to his 
estate.
Ms M has asked whether Mr M would have received his share of the compensation if he was 
still alive? The answer is that he most likely wouldnt, as he would still be jointly responsible 
for the debt, and its likely that NatWest would have also used his half of the compensation 
to offset against the balance outstanding. 
In summary I think NatWest has calculated the compensation fairly and in the way Id expect 
it to. And I think it is fair for NatWest to use Ms Ms share of the compensation to offset 
against the outstanding balance of the loan.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M and the 
estate of Mr M to accept or reject my decision before 17 May 2021.
