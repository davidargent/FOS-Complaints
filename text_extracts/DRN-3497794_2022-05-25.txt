The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA do not allow him to easily and readily
communicate with them in a proper and timely manner and that their system is difficult to
navigate.
What happened
Mr W made an online purchase using PayPal to a third party company. But he was
suspicious about the purchase as he had no acknowledgement from the supplier. After a few
days, Mr W checked the suppliers website and there was no delivery date scheduled or any
other information he had requested via email.
Mr W contacted PayPal. He said he had great difficulty navigating and reporting his problem,
having to constantly log into his account. Mr W says that after numerous attempts and after
about an hour of trying, he managed to log the transaction as unauthorised, as he had still
not received any information from the merchant.
Mr W received confirmation of the dispute from PayPal, but PayPal closed this down within
24 hours, saying no unauthorised transaction had taken place. Mr W says that he was
unable to explain his concerns and problems. He said that again he tried to spend an hour or
so trying to report this online to PayPal, but he said he had no way to email or message
them.
Mr W says he managed to contact PayPal by phone. The call handler apologised to him and
told him not to worry as he would get his money back and they opened a dispute for him. Mr
W says he received an email from PayPal confirming the disputed amount, then a further
email to confirm PayPal had communicated with the merchant. Mr W says there was a link
on their email which he could access the information about his case, but when he clicked on
it, he says he couldnt access anything. PayPal then sent Mr W a tracking reference from the
supplier, but there was no link.
Mr W brought his complaint to our service and said he was frustrated with the lack of clear
and easy access to PayPals customer service. He wanted PayPal to put things right by
altering the confusing and frustrating system they have in place and to stop links when hes
logged into his account, taking him back to a log on page.
PayPal did not uphold his complaint. They said that Mr W notified them on 8 June 2021, that
he had not authorised the transaction. PayPal completed a full investigation into this, but
they were unable to find any evidence that this was the case, as Mr W had confirmed to
them he knowingly made the purchase.
PayPal said that their call handler manually completed a non-receipt buyer transaction on
Mr Ws behalf and while PayPal received a tracking number from the merchant, indicating
that this had been successfully delivered on 23 June 2021, they were unable to verify that
the item had been delivered to his address, therefore they closed the dispute in his favour
and refunded him the cost of his transaction.
PayPal also noted that Mr W had made several buyer complaints in the past, but they sent
Mr W the steps to raise a dispute in the future if he needed to do so. They also reiterated to
him that he can message them any time and they gave him steps on how to do this and also
how to access their contacts page.
Mr W said the links in their response was nonsense and they do not address the issue of
being able to communicate with them easily and readily in a proper and timely manner. Our
investigator upheld Mr Ws complaint. She said PayPal hadnt treated Mr W fairly as he had
a very negative experience when using their system. She said it was difficult to find out
exactly what was going wrong as Mr W didnt have any screen shots of the problems he
encountered. Our investigator said PayPal should pay Mr W Â£50 as he spent a lot of time
trying to navigate PayPals system.
PayPal asked for an Ombudsman to review the complaint. They said they had submitted
evidence to our service that the case had been opened immediately after Mr W had made
them aware of it.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional 
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr W has made a number of points to this service and Ive considered and read everything
hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body Ill be
focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
Mr W has said that he wants PayPal to put things right by altering the confusing and
frustrating system they have in place and to stop links when hes logged into his account,
taking him back to a log on page. But I must be clear to Mr W that our service is unable to
tell a business how to manage their own processes such as their design of their web pages
or security controls they have in place, as these are commercial decisions that PayPal are
entitled to decide for themselves as a business.
Ive considered what Mr W has said about him spending an hour or so to try and raise the
dispute. I asked PayPal to provide me with Mr Ws log in details for the day he raised the
dispute. I can see that Mr W logged into his account on 8 June 2021 at 13:26pm. He then
logged into his account at 13:27pm. This could be part of the problem Mr W has previously
described about being logged in then needing to log in again. But I dont think theres been
too much of an impact here as this was 23 seconds after he previously logged in that it
shows he was logged in again. But Ive also considered that it could be part of a two stage
log in where Mr W may have to complete a security prompt.
I can also see that at 13:30pm Mr W managed to raise a dispute. So from when Mr W first
logged into his account, it took him less than four minutes to raise the dispute. I cant rule out
that Mr W could have spent an hour before this without logging into his account to find out
how he could raise a dispute or contact PayPal, but I cant hold PayPal responsible for this
and Ill explain why.
Ive looked at PayPals home website, to see how you can navigate it if a user is not logged
into their account on both a computer and a mobile phone to see if there are any differences.
On a computer, across the top of the screen there is a section titled help. Ive also looked
at PayPals homepage on a mobile phone. In the top left, there is a section titled menu and
then help. On both versions of the website, there is a section which says Resolution
Centre, which explains that this is a section to resolve transaction or account issues.So because Mr W had an issue with a transaction from a third party company, it would be
reasonable for him to click on this link. This would then prompt him to log into his account.
But when Mr W logged into his account on the day he logged a dispute, Mr W was able to
raise a dispute within minutes.
PayPals help page also has a section titled message centre. Here it says the user can
send, receive and view your PayPal messages. This link would again take you to the log in
screen. In addition on the home page of the help section, there is a section which says
contact us. When you click on that link it brings up a box to free type an issue or sections
which you can get more information. Disputes and account limitations is one of these
sections. You can then click on disputes and then buyer protection, which is what Mr W was
wanting to benefit from.
This section then details how to raise a dispute, but it also has other options, such as
message us, resolution centre ask the community or call us. I clicked on the call option
and it gave me the option to log in or call as a guest. When I clicked call as a guest it
displayed a telephone number and showed the line was open from 08:00-18:30 Monday to
Sunday and a freephone number from a landline only. So if Mr W was struggling with how to
raise a dispute, it would be reasonable for him to click on one of the options Ive mentioned,
as soon as he was struggling to raise a dispute.
So Im not persuaded that I can hold PayPal responsible for the time it took Mr W to find
certain things on their website. Ive also considered that if Mr W tried to research raising a
dispute while logged into his account between 5-7June. But PayPal have confirmed to me
that even if you are logged into your account, by clicking the icon in the top left hand side of
the screen (if using their website on a phone) this will display the help section (amongst
other sections). If their mobile application is used, then he couldve clicked the icon in the top
left hand side to access the help section. Or if Mr W was using a computer, the help section
would be displayed across the top of the page. So Im satisfied that PayPal had options of
help available to Mr W to communicate with them in an easy and timely manner.
Im satisfied that PayPal completed their investigations in a fair and reasonable manner. I
say this as Mr W had initially raised the wrong type of dispute. PayPal show different ways
which a dispute can be raised in the help section and what the different types of disputes are
regarding. So I cant hold PayPal responsible for Mr W raising an incorrect dispute, when the
dispute page shows three different types of disputes and gives an explanation of which type
of dispute is for a certain issue.
PayPal were able to see from Mr Ws account activity that this would indicate he made the
purchase and not an unauthorised user, so Im persuaded PayPal were fair to close this
within the 24 hours that they did close the dispute once they had completed their own
investigation.
After the correct type of dispute was raised on the phone with PayPal on 9 June 2021,
PayPal closed the dispute in Mr Ws favour on 25 June 2021. As the merchant had indicated
to PayPal that they had delivered the purchase to Mr W on 23 June 2021, Im persuaded
that PayPal reimbursed Mr W in a timely manner after concluding their own investigations
when they could not verify the merchants claims of delivering the purchase to Mr W.
Ive also considered what Mr W has said about the links that PayPal had sent him in their
final response. PayPal forwarded our service a copy of the final response, but the links do
appear to be functional. Even without clicking on the links, there are clear instructions of how
Mr W can contact them. PayPal did not include a link to the tracking website in their finalresponse (although they included the tracking number and the tracking company used), but
this was after they had already refunded Mr W his money for the transaction. But I can see
on a follow up response to Mr W on 14 July 2021, that they did send a link and the link does
show the journey of the delivery of the item  but not to Mr Ws registered address  and that
is why the dispute was found in his favour.
In summary, Im satisfied that PayPal had options of help available to Mr W to communicate
with them in an easy and timely manner. Im also satisfied that they investigated his dispute
in a fair and reasonable manner. So it follows I dont intend to ask PayPal to do anything
further.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final 
decision. PayPal responded and said they had no further information to add. Mr W 
responded and he said he did not accept the provisional decision. He said he had 
experienced problems with communicating with PayPal and he leaves the matter to rest as 
he has now closed his account with PayPal. Mr W offered no further information for me to 
consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party have provided me with any further information to consider, then my final 
decision and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
My final decision
I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2022.
