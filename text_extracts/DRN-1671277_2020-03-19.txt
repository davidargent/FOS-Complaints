The complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that Sunny failed to correctly and appropriately assess whether he could sustainably 
make the loan repayments. He says that he was in a poor financial situation. He thinks 
Sunny shouldve seen this and not lent to him.
What happened
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be partially upheld. Both Sunny and Mr K 
disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Ks complaint should be upheld. A copy of 
the background to the complaint and my provisional findings follow this and form part of this 
final decision.
What I said in my provisional decision:
'This complaint is about 14 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr K between May 2019 and 
July 2019. All of the loans had a term of around six months. And Mr K was due to make six 
monthly repayments. Some of the information Sunny has provided about the loans is 
summarised below:

Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. He thought the checks Sunny had carried out for loans 
1 to 3 were proportionate and so the business was acting reasonably when it lent to Mr K for 
these loans. He didnt think the checks Sunny carried out went far enough before approving 
loans 4 to 14. And he thought better checks would've shown Sunny that Mr K couldn't sustainably repay this lending. And so he thought Sunny shouldnt have approved this 
lending.
Sunny agreed in part with this. It didnt think it had acted incorrectly when it approved loans 1 
to 7. But it agreed that it shouldnt have approved loans 8 to 14. It made an offer of 
compensation in respect of loans 8 to 14.
Mr K didnt accept this offer. And he also didnt agree with the adjudicators opinion not to 
uphold loans 1 to 3.
So, as no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive provisionally decided to uphold Mr 
Ks complaint and Ive explained why below.
I can see that Mr K has made reference to other ombudsmans decisions. But I should say 
that I am required to look at each case on its individual merits. And whilst there may be 
similarities between complaints, consumers individual circumstances are often very different. 
So it isnt right to say that because one complaint reaches an outcome that another 
complaint, which may seem similar, would also.
Sunny has provided two different summaries of the information that it obtained at the time of 
sale. In the first summary the business it said it recorded that Mr K had a monthly income of 
£2,236 but it also provided another summary that showed he had a monthly income of £1,900. Its not clear at this point which is the correct figure. But I dont think I need better 
information about this to fairly decide this complaint.
Both sets of information suggest that Mr K had a monthly rental expenditure of £250 and that 
he had a monthly essential expenditure of £358. It also showed that he was spending 
£1,154 on credit. The repayment for loan1 was scheduled to be £133.
I understand that Mr K has two dependent children. And so the amount of essential 
expenditure is very low. And his existing expenditure on credit is very high. This would 
mean that Mr K would be spending around £1,300 on credit going forward if the Sunny 
repayment is added to this. I think this is a strong indication, given the other information 
Sunny had, that Mr K mayve been in significant financial difficulty.
So I think that it wouldve been proportionate to fully review Mr Ks financial situation. And I 
think that Sunny needed to verify the information Mr K provided where possible. This was to 
make sure that Mr K was in a position to make the repayments sustainably.
I dont think Sunny did this. So I need to think about what Sunny wouldve seen if it had 
carried out proportionate checks.
Mr K has provided some information about his financial circumstances which includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit report. I accept that this isnt exactly what Sunny 
wouldve seen at the time. And it could've verified this information another way. But I think it 
wouldve found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think its 
reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that Mr K was borrowing and repaying significant amounts to other short term 
lenders. And he was also, at times, struggling to make his regular expenditure payments.
And I think its reasonable to say that proportionate checks wouldve also shown Sunny that 
a substantial portion of Mr Ks income was being spent on online betting. And I think that if 
Sunny wouldve seen this, it wouldn't have thought it was responsible to lend to Mr K.
I think that Sunny wouldve found out this information if it had carried out proportionate 
checks. And I think Sunny wouldve seen Mr K wouldnt have been able repay any of this 
lending in a sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 1 to 14 to Mr 
K and I think hes lost out as a result of this.
So Im currently minded to uphold Mr Ks complaint about loans 1 to 14.
Our adjudicator thought that Sunny shouldnt have approved any lending from loan 6 
onwards due to the pattern of lending. Having thought about this I don't think Mr K's patttern 
of lending itself shows that the lending was unsustainable at any time. So I dont think Mr Ks 
complaint should be upheld for this reason.'
Mr K agreed with my provisional decision. Sunny made an offer to pay compensation in 
respect of loans 4 to 14. But I think this offer was made as part of a review Sunny has made 
of its cases at this Service and didnt relate to my decision. Sunny didnt comment on what I 
said in my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive re-considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Sunny and Mr K didnt raise any new points after receiving my provisional decision. So Ive 
reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons.
Putting things right
 Sunny should:
refund all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 1 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans 1 to 14 from Mr Ks credit file;
I understand Mr K still owes Sunny some of the principal balance he borrowed on loan 11. If 
this is the case (and for any other loan where this is the case) Sunny should remove all the 
interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny should then re-work the 
account as if all payments made by Mr K went to towards the principal. But importantly, 
Sunny needs to make sure that Mr K doesnt repay more than the principal amount 
borrowed.
If after doing this Mr K hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation. If, Mr K has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt entitled to make any deductions for it 
from the amount it needs to pay Mr K.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 April 2020.
