DRN-3773220
The complaint
Mr L is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA continue to share his personal data
with a third-party company without his permission.
What happened
Mr L logged into his online PayPal account and removed his consent for PayPal to share his
data with third-party companies. However, Mr L then noticed that PayPal continued to share
his data with a specific third-party company, despite his withdrawing his consent for them to
do so. Mr L wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Ls complaint. They felt that they had taken the steps necessary,
following Mr Ls withdrawal of consent, to stop sharing Mr Ls data with the third-party
company. So, they didnt uphold the complaint. Mr L wasnt satisfied with PayPals response,
so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt that PayPal had been able to
demonstrate that they had stopped sharing Mr Ls data with the third-party company, and so
they also didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr L remained dissatisfied, especially as he continued to see his PayPal data being shared
with the third-party company. So, the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 27 September 2022 as follows:
It seems apparent from the screenshots that Mr L has provided this service from his 
online PayPal account that PayPal are continuing to share Mr Ls data with the
third-party company in question and that when Mr L attempts to remove his consent 
for PayPal to do so that an error message appears and that the consent to share 
information remains in place.
In consideration of the screenshots provided to this service by Mr L, its difficult to 
conclude anything other than that PayPal are continuing to share Mr Ls data with a 
third-party company, despite Mr Ls express instruction to them to not do so  in the 
form of both Mr Ls attempts to remove the consent from his PayPal profile and his 
subsequent complaint about the matter to PayPal.
Several months ago, this service asked for PayPals comments on Mr Ls being 
unable to remove the data sharing consent from his online account profile. But 
unfortunately, since that time, and despite several further requests, PayPal havent 
responded to that request in any meaningful way.
As such, in consideration of the evidence provided by Mr L, I feel that Im left with no
reasonable option here other than to issue a provisional decision upholding this 
complaint in Mr Ls favour and instructing PayPal to take whatever steps are 
necessary to ensure that Mr Ls wishes in regard to the non-sharing of his data are 
honoured. PayPal must take such steps within 28-days of the date of any final 
decision subsequently issued on this complaint.
Additionally, my provisional decision also includes that PayPal must make a payment 
of £250 to Mr L as compensation for the trouble and upset that hes incurred while 
attempting to resolve this issue.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr L and PayPal the opportunity to provide any 
response to that provisional decision that they might wish me to consider before I moved to 
issue a final decision. Mr L confirmed that he was happy to accept my provisional decision, 
whereas PayPal did not respond.
As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Mr Ls 
favour on the basis outlined above. And I can confirm that my final decision is that I do 
uphold this complaint in Mr Ls favour on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
PayPal must ensure that, within 28-day from the date of this letter, Mr Ls wishes in regard to 
the non-sharing of his data are honoured.
PayPal must also make a payment of £250 to Mr L as compensation for the trouble and 
upset that hes incurred here thus far.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2022.
