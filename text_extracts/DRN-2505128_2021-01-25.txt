The complaint
Miss H complained that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat.co.uk) acted irresponsibly when it gave her unaffordable loans.
What happened
Miss H took out two MoneyBoat loans in May and June 2020.

One of our adjudicators reviewed what Miss H and MoneyBoat told us about these loans. 
Overall, our adjudicator thought that given the loan amounts, what was apparent about 
Miss Hs circumstances and her history with the lender, it wouldnt have been proportionate 
for MoneyBoat to ask Miss H for the amount of information needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable. Our adjudicator didnt think there was any reason why MoneyBoat shouldve 
been prompted to check what Miss H had said about her financial situation. 
And our adjudicator didn't think that the number of loans Miss H had taken out, the amounts 
shed borrowed or the length of time shed been borrowing from MoneyBoat shouldve 
alerted MoneyBoat to think she was having money problems. 
So he didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint. 
Miss H disagreed with our adjudicators view. 
Miss H mainly said that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided these two loans within such a 
small time frame and that she was not receiving her full pay. She said that her credit report 
wouldve shown three defaults on her record and if MoneyBoat had asked her more detailed 
questions it wouldve also realised she had significant rent arrears.
So the complaint comes to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Ive used this approach to help me decide this complaint.
MoneyBoat provided Miss H with high-interest loans intended for short-term use so it needed 
to make sure that it didnt provide them irresponsibly. 
MoneyBoat was required to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand whether 
any lending was sustainable for Miss H before providing it. Our website sets out what we 
typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks were proportionate. Generally, 
we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of how much 
information it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early stages of a 
lending relationship. But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers 
income was low or the amount lent was high. 
And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of it becoming 
unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect a lender to 
be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly. 
Having carefully thought about everything Ive seen and been told, Im not upholding 
Miss Hs complaint. Heres why I say this.
MoneyBoat says it agreed to Miss Hs applications after carrying out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks. And it relied on information Miss H provided about her monthly income 
and expenditure as well as information obtained from credit reference agencies. 
It says the information it had about Miss H showed that both loans were affordable for her. 
I've thought about each loan in turn.
loan 1
I dont think MoneyBoat was wrong to lend Miss H loan 1. As this was her first MoneyBoat 
loan Miss H didn't have any track record with the lender that shouldve alerted MoneyBoat to 
any underlying money problems. 
The information MoneyBoat had gathered about Miss Hs finances suggested that she was 
well able to afford this borrowing. It looks like she told MoneyBoat her take home pay was 
well over £2000 and she gave a breakdown of her expenses (which MoneyBoat boosted to 
allow a safety margin). This left her with more than £1400  which shouldve been ample 
disposable income to cover the cost of the repayments on this loan.
Ive kept in mind that Miss H said there had been some flaws in the information MoneyBoat 
relied on. Its worth remembering that a lender might only see a small portion of a borrowers 
credit file, or some data might be missing or anonymised or not up to date. I also understand 
that not all payday and short term lenders report to the same credit reference agencies. So a 
lenders credit check might not show all the information someone could see (or expect to 
see) on their own credit file.
I've taken into account the information that appeared on credit checks that MoneyBoat 
carried out. 
It looks like MoneyBoats credit checks didnt show anything sufficiently adverse that 
shouldve prompted it to ask Miss H more searching questions about her financial situation or check the information shed provided. And looking at the information MoneyBoat had 
gathered, it looked like Miss H shouldve been able to comfortably pay loan 1. 
So I dont uphold Miss Hs complaint about loan 1.
loan 2
Miss H repaid loan 1 early and took out loan 2 around a week or so later  borrowing a 
significantly bigger loan this time. But I dont think the size of the loan or the short gap 
between these loans was enough to make MoneyBoat think that it shouldnt have continued 
to lend to Miss H. 
I dont think MoneyBoat wouldve had any reason to think that this loan wasnt likely to be 
sustainably affordable for Miss H.
I cant fairly say that Miss H had shown any signs that shed found it hard to pay for loan 1. 
MoneyBoat asked Miss H to update the information she provided about her finances and 
updated its credit checks. The figures shed declared, and the information MoneyBoat had 
collected, seem to support MoneyBoats lending decision.
Miss H appears to have declared that her income was £2000 when she applied for this loan. 
Some of her declared expenses had increased since she took out loan 1  other costs had 
gone down. But it looked like this still left her with more than £800 to spend after the other 
expenses shed declared had been paid.
I've taken into account that Miss H said MoneyBoat never asked her about rent arrears. But 
I think its fair to say that MoneyBoat gave Miss H fair opportunity to provide relevant 
information about her spending and it was entitled, at this early stage in their relationship, to 
rely on the information she provided. 
And there wasnt anything in the credit check information that MoneyBoat could see that 
wouldve made MoneyBoat think that Miss H would be likely to find it difficult to afford the 
repayments for loan 2 in a sustainable way. 
I dont think that proportionate checks for this loan required MoneyBoat to take steps to 
verify the information Miss H had provided in support of her loan application. 
Overall, I cant say that I've seen enough to be able to uphold Miss Hs complaint about 
loan 2.
Thinking about the amount of the total monthly repayments she had to make for each of her 
loans, the questions MoneyBoat asked Miss H and keeping in mind that these were Miss Hs 
first two loans with MoneyBoat, I dont think it was unreasonable for MoneyBoat to rely on 
the level of information Miss H was providing. 
Im sorry that Miss H found repaying these loans difficult. And I can appreciate Miss Hs 
concern that her financial situation wasnt fully reflected either in the information she 
provided or the other information MoneyBoat obtained. 
But MoneyBoats lending decisions dont seem unreasonable to me based on the 
information it had available at the time. And, at this stage of the lending relationship, and 
given these loan amounts, I dont think proportionate checks wouldve required MoneyBoat 
to ask Miss H to prove what she was declaring or check other information sources to verify 
what she had told them (or omitted to say) about her financial circumstances. So I dont think MoneyBoat did anything wrong when it made its lending decisions based on the information 
it had at the time.
I appreciate that this outcome will be disappointing for Miss H but I hope that setting things 
out as I've done helps explain how Ive reached this conclusion.
I take this opportunity to remind MoneyBoat (or any third party if the debt Miss H owes has 
been sold) that it should discuss payment options with Miss H and treat her fairly and 
sympathetically if Miss H needs further time to pay what she still owes.
I can see that MoneyBoat has already provided Miss H with some information about where 
to get help and advice about managing her finances. But just to remind Miss H, if she would 
like help to deal with her money problems theres more information about how to get free 
debt advice on our website  or we can provide contact details if she gives us a call. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I dont uphold Miss Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 February 2021.
