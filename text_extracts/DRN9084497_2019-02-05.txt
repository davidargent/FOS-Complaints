K821x#15complaint
Miss C complains that Uncle Buck Finance LLP didnt do proper affordability checks  before 
approving her loans.
background
Miss C had four loans  from Uncle Buck between November  2015 and October  2016:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 19 Nov 2015 £250 3m £107.94 29 Jan 2016 On time
2 1 Feb 2016 £400 3m £209.58 10 May 2016 On time
3 18 Jul 2016 £300 3m £144.81 10 Oct 2016 On time
4 27 Oct 2016 £350 3m £158.39 10 Jan 2017 9 Jun 2017
Uncle Buck  says it asked  Miss C about  her income  and expenditure, checked  her credit 
record and verified  her employment.  Based  on the information it received, Uncle Buck  says 
Miss Cs applications  met its lending  criteria  and the loans were approved.
Miss C repaid the first two instalments of loan 4 on time, but her final instalment failed to go 
through. Uncle Buck says it offered Miss C a reduced settlement on 4 May 2017  and Miss C 
repaid this over six weeks,  in line with the arrangement.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He was satisfied Uncle Buck  
did enough checks for the first three loans, but considered  it should  have asked Miss C if 
she had any other short-term loans before approving loan 4. He found that, had it done so, 
its likely  Uncle Buck would have found  Miss C needed to make  repayments of over £230 to 
another short-term  loan company so the Uncle Buck repayment wasnt  affordable  to her. He 
recommended Uncle  Buck  should refund interest  and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) on 
loan 4 and remove  any associated negative information from her credit file.
Uncle Buck  responded to say, in summary,  that even with the additional £230, Miss C could 
afford the instalments out of her declared disposable income of £500. It adds that at the time 
of the loan decision, it could not have known  what repayments Miss C had in the future.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Uncle Buck  was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure 
Miss C could afford to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those  checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss C was borrowing, and her lending history. 
But there was no set list of checks Uncle Buck had to do.
Loans 1 to 3
Miss C told Uncle  Buck  that her income was £1,350 throughout the period of her borrowing. 
For these loans her expenses varied, but the minimum disposable  income she declared was 
£745. Uncle Buck also checked Miss Cs credit file and found her credit record  to be 
acceptable. As the maximum  scheduled  repayment  for these loans was just under £210,  I 
cannot say that Uncle  Buck was wrong  to conclude the loans were affordable to her.

When Miss C applied  for her fourth loan, I consider this could have indicated she was in a 
pattern of borrowing. Shed also declared  a much lower disposable income, of £500. As a 
result, I consider  a proportionate check should have included asking Miss C whether she 
had any other outstanding  short-term loans. Had it done this, Uncle  Buck is likely to have 
found that Miss C also needed to make payments totalling over £230  to another  short-term 
loan provider.
As this would have  left Miss C with just over £100 for unforeseen expenses, I dont consider  
the repayments on loan 4 were sustainable over a three-month term.
I acknowledge Uncle Buck says that the repayments were still affordable, and that Miss C 
had disposable  income remaining, but I dont consider it was responsible  to continue  to lend 
to Miss C in those circumstances. Miss Cs credit file showed numerous defaults  on her 
account, one of which was earlier in 2016  and, although I accept this does not preclude her 
from being approved  for short-term lending, this is another factor  to consider.
In addition, although I accept Uncle Buck could not have known what repayments  Miss C 
was due to make after shed taken out loan 4, it could have found out that shed borrowed 
over £500  from another lender in July and August 2016 and repayments on these loans 
continued beyond  the first instalment  of loan 4.
So, for the above reasons, I dont  consider  Uncle Buck should have approved loan 4.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. Uncle Buck  Finance  LLP should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss C paid on loan 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 4 from Miss Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Miss C a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 March  2019.
