K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account and hasnt explained 
why it did so. He also complains that NatWest didnt release the closing balance to him in 
cash. Mr L wants NatWest to explain why it closed his account.
background
Mr L had a business account with NatWest.
In January 2018, NatWest carried out a review of Mr Ls account.  Following the review  NatWest 
decided to close Mr Ls account. NatWest wrote  to Mr L and gave him two months notice to 
make alternative banking arrangements. And it issued him a cheque for the closing balance. 
Mr L complained to NatWest and asked for an explanation for the account closure. He said 
NatWests behaviour was unreasonable and illegal. NatWest said it had acted in accordance  
with the terms and conditions when it closed  the account. Mr L wasnt happy with this 
response. He wants NatWest to provide the reasons it decided to close his account. And 
says staff need to be investigated for fraud. 
An investigator looked at Mr Ls complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done  anything wrong 
when it closed Mr Ls account and sent him a cheque  for the closing  balance.  Mr L 
disagreed. He still wants to know why his account  was closed. He thinks  NatWest should 
have allowed him to withdraw his closing balance in cash. As no agreement could be 
reached the matter  has come to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive reached the 
same conclusion as the investigator.  And Ill will explain why.
I can see Mr L feels very strongly about  whats happened here. Thats clear from whats hes 
said to us and to NatWest. Whilst I appreciate Mr Ls frustration, its important to point  out 
that the only thing in question here is whether NatWest has done  what it should have done.  
And treated Mr L fairly. I think it has. Ill explain why.
NatWest has provided me with a copy of its letter which it sent to Mr L on 13 February 2018. 
This says it has decided that NatWest was no longer going to provide banking  facilities.  And 
that Mr L needed to make  alternative  arrangements within 60 days. 
I appreciate the impact  this had for Mr L. But NatWest has acted within the terms and 
conditions of the account. It was entitled  to close  the account having  given  Mr L 60 days 
notice. And it wasnt required to give Mr L a reason, as much as he would like to know.  So, I 
cant say NatWest has done anything wrong by not providing this information to him.  
Ref: DRN95121042I appreciate that the closure of the account has caused Mr L inconvenience and upset. 
But the bank can make commercial decisions about  who it offers banking services to. 
They cannot  unfairly discriminate against  a customer. But they can say they no longer wish 
to do business  with individuals. Thats because theyve got the commercial  freedom to 
decide who they want to contract with. And Im satisfied that NatWest has exercised  its 
commercial decision legitimately when  it decided to close  Mr Ls account.  So, I cannot fairly  
and reasonably say its done anything wrong.
Mr L is also unhappy that NatWest wouldnt pay the closing  balance of his account to him in 
cash. He says NatWest  effectively held him to ransom and illegally  withheld his money.  But 
NatWest has pointed  out that as Mr Ls business  still existed legally the money belonged to 
the company so it would  be wrong  of it to pay the money to any other entity  or individual.  I 
think NatWests approach is correct on this point. So, all in all I think NatWests  position on 
the balance is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  
I understand that Mr L didnt cash the cheque  NatWest  initially  issued to him on 20 April 
2018. And has since reissued a cheque to Mr L for his closing balance of Â£2,503.91.  So, I 
wont be asking it to do anything further on this matter
In conclusion, I appreciate  that my decision will come as a great frustration and 
disappointment to Mr L. But Mr L is entitled  to reject my decision. If he does  reject  it then it is 
not binding on him or NatWest. And it is then open to him to raise these issues in any legal 
proceedings he wishes to instigate.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 November  2019.
