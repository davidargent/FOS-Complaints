K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him in an 
irresponsible matter.  
background
Mr C took out ten loans  with QuickQuid between March 2012 and February 2014. Mr C 
extended the term of loans  five, seven and ten. He didnt repay the final loan and QuickQuid 
has passed the debt to a third party debt collection agency. A summary  of Mr Cs lending 
with QuickQuid is as follows:

In response to Mr Cs complaint, QuickQuid offered to waive one late fee in relation to loan 
ten. 
QuickQuid said that Mr Cs complaint about the first five loans was made too late. But Mr C 
has since confirmed that he no longer  wishes to complain  about loans one to five. So, I wont 
make any findings in relation to those loans.  But Ill take them into account when considering 
the extent of Mr Cs relationship with QuickQuid.
One of our adjudicators has assessed Mr Cs complaint. She said that QuickQuid shouldnt  
have agreed to lend to Mr C after and including  loan six. The adjudicator  set out what  
QuickQuid should  do to put things  right.
Mr C accepted the adjudicators assessment but QuickQuid didnt. It offered to reimburse  
interest and charges, with interest,  in relation to loans eight and ten. QuickQuid said that it 
would apply that amount to the outstanding  loan and pay the balance to Mr C. It also said it 
would remove any entries about those loans  from Mr Cs credit  file. Mr C didnt accept  
QuickQuids offer. Mr C says that QuickQuid subsequently offered to waive  the remaining 
balance he owes but QuickQuid hasnt given that offer via this service. 
As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  its been passed to me, an ombudsman,  to 
decide. 
Ref: DRN40725232my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance  and later 
the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.  As Ive said, Im looking at loans six to 
ten. Mr C took out loan six in March 2013,  approximately three months after hed repaid his 
previous loan with QuickQuid. I dont think that amounts  to a significant gap such  that it 
breaks the chain  of lending here.  
Ref: DRN40725233Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because  by loan six, Mr C had been borrowing from QuickQuid for a year.  And 
hed had difficulty repaying loan five on time. His overall pattern of borrowing suggested  he 
had become persistently reliant on short-term  loans.  
Loan six was for a relatively modest  amount of £100  but it was followed by significant 
increases in borrowing. Whilst the amounts  Mr C borrowed from QuickQuid fluctuated,  the 
pattern of lending itself shows  that the loans from loan six were unsustainable.  
Mr C wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  ten was taken 
out almost two years after Mr Cs first loan with QuickQuid. And it was for a substantially  
larger amount. Mr C had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  an intermittent 
debt to QuickQuid  over an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide lending  from loan six 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness  by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. And the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  implications  on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I dont think that QuickQuid should have  given Mr C loans six to ten and QuickQuid 
should put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans six to ten;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans six to ten should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
Mr C didnt fully repay  the last loan and QuickQuid passed the debt to a third party debt 
collection agency. I dont  know  for sure whether  Mr C has repaid  anything to the debt 
collection agency but based  on what hes said, it appears that he didnt.  
It seems  reasonable that if Mr C still owes some of the capital  he borrowed, part of the 
refund due to him should be used  to repay  that debt. But to do so, QuickQuid must first take 
the debt back  into its own books  it may have already done so - and reduce it to reflect just 
the capital that Mr C borrowed.  Once it has recovered the capital  Mr C borrowed, any 
remaining compensation should  be paid directly to Mr C. 
Ref: DRN40725234If QuickQuid is unable,  or unwilling, to repurchase the debts within  four weeks of Mr C 
accepting my decision, it must ensure that all its interest and charges added  to these loans, 
and any other interest and charges  added  by the debt collection agency are refunded  to 
Mr C, so he can choose whether to use the compensation to settle his debt directly.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Cs complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC should 
put things right as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 July 2019.
