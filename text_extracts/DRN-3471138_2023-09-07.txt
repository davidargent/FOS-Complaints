The complaint
Mr A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made to it for a refund of the money that he paid 
for a holiday ownership product. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mr A and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to buy a holiday ownership product in 
October 2006. The purchase price was £16,193. I understand that Mr A also entered into a 
credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance and that he used £16,193 of the credit 
that was available to him to pay for the holiday ownership product. The credit was on buy 
now  pay later terms so the payment wouldnt be charged to his accounts until six months 
after the purchase. Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was repaid in July 2008. 
Mr As representative, on behalf of Mr A, made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in 
February 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Barclays 
Partner Finance said that Mr A was out of time to bring a misrepresentation claim under 
section 75 or a claim under section 140A. It also said that customers were able to book 
holidays and were able to list their property for resale subject to and in accordance with their 
agreement so it didnt agree that a breach of contract had occurred.
Mr A wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Mr As 
complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to Mr A; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr As ability to afford the loan (though it should have referred to the 
credit), unduly pressured him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure him; the product was misrepresented to him; and the holiday company 
was in liquidation so was in breach of contract as it cant provide the goods or service sold to 
Mr A; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140. It said that the claim should 
also be considered under section 75. 
Mr A also provided a client statement in support of his claims in which he also described 
other purchases of holiday products  but I consider it to be clear from his representatives 
February 2021 letter and his complaint form that his complaint is about the purchase that he 
made in October 2006 (and the only document from the time of the purchases that has been 
provided is the purchase agreement that he and his wife signed in October 2006). Mr As 
wife has sadly passed away.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr As complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr As misrepresentation claim 
under section 75 to turn it down. He said that the resorts at which Mr A had his holiday 
ownership product were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday 
companys liquidation so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract. He thought 
that Mr As section 140A claim was raised too late and he said that he hadnt seen any 
persuasive evidence to show that the credit was unaffordable for Mr A.
Mr As representative, on behalf of Mr A, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that it had instructed counsel to provide detailed submissions about the 
time bar, but no further information or submissions have been received. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr As complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr As complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to 
his claims;
Mr As claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr As claim under section 75 is that the holiday company has gone into liquidation 
so is in breach of contract and that the holiday product was misrepresented to him 
and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to 
them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance 
would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the holiday ownership product in October 2006 as that was the latest time 
that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when he also entered into the credit card agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until February 2021, more than fourteen years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to the claim and I find that it was reasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued  I understand that the holiday company went into 
liquidation in January 2020 and Mr As representative made a breach of contract 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021 so I consider that Mr As breach 
of contract claim was made in time;
our investigator said that the resorts at which Mr A had his holiday ownership product 
were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday companys liquidation 
so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract  neither Mr A nor his 
representative has provided any further evidence in response to that finding to show 
that Mr As use of his holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr As use of his 
holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the 
holiday company so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Barclays Partner Finance to take any action under section 75 in response to 
the liquidation of the holiday company;
Mr As representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr A and 
Barclays Partner Finance because Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to 
the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr A and the holiday company unduly 
pressured him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices 
to pressure him;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Ive been provided with a copy of a credit card account statement which shows that 
Mr A used £16,193 of credit from Barclays Partner Finance in October 2006 to pay 
for a holiday ownership product but Ive not been provided with a copy of the credit 
card agreement;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was repaid in July 2008 and Mr A says 
that he took out a £50,000 mortgage which he used, in part, to repay the credit  he 
also says that this was very distressing for him as he only managed to repay the 
mortgage in 2020;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the credit card agreement 
continued after July 2008 so Im satisfied that the credit card agreement ended in 
July 2008;
Mr A would have had six years from then to bring a claim under section 140A against 
Barclays Partner Finance but a claim wasnt made until February 2021, more than 
twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so 
I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the claim and I find that it 
was reasonable for it to have rejected that claim; 
Mr As representative also says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr As ability to afford the credit, Mr A says that he used a mortgage 
to repay the credit and Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit card agreement 
ended in July 2008;Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mr A in October 
2006 when it was made available to him and, although he says that it was very 
distressing for him as he only managed to repay the mortgage in 2020, Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that hes experienced any financial 
difficulties as a result of the credit that was provided to him; 
Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mr A asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its assessment of his ability to afford the credit before his 
representatives February 2021 letter  as the credit was made available to him in 
October 2006 and was repaid in July 2008, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have raised any concerns about that assessment or the affordability of 
the credit before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credit wasnt 
affordable for Mr A in October 2006 when it was made available to him;
I sympathise with Mr A for the loss of his wife and the issues that hes had with his 
holiday ownership product but I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to 
the claims that had been made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr A any of the money that he paid under the 
credit card agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2023.
