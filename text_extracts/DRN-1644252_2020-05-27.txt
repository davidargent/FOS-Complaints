The complaint
Miss C says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss C had five loan accounts with Sunny. The first was a line of credit, which allowed
Miss C to make drawdowns up to her credit limit and then repay them in up to five 
instalments. Loans 2 to 5 were instalments loans. I've included some information Sunny 
provided about the loans below.

An adjudicator considered Miss C's complaint and thought it should be upheld in part. He 
didn't think Sunny should've approved loan 5 as he thought Sunny had enough information 
to realise the loan wasn't affordable. He also thought Sunny shouldn't have allowed Miss C 
to make the drawdown of 10/12/2014 as Miss C's credit balance wasn't decreasing over the 
life of the agreement.
Sunny agreed with what the adjudicator has said about loan 5 but not the 
drawdown of 10/12/2014. Miss C also made further points and didn't accept Sunny's offer. 
So the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I'll start by looking at the instalment loans 2 to 4, which the adjudicator did not think should 
be upheld. I think it was reasonable for Sunny to agree to these loans. It carried out 
assessments of Miss C's income and expenditure, which I think was a proportionate 
approach to take and these assessments suggested the loan repayments were affordable.
I don't think there were any circumstances which suggest Sunny's checks should've gone 
further than this.
For loan 1 - I can understand why Miss C, who has described her difficult personal 
circumstances, feels that Sunny was wrong to lend to her throughout 2014. But I don't think 
it's likely the sort of checks I'd have expected Sunny to carry out - such as asking Miss C for 
information about her income and expenditure and carrying out credit checks - would've 
suggested the line of credit wasn't affordable for her. So I think Sunny acted reasonably by 
initially providing the facility.
I've gone on to look at how Miss C used the facility, to see if there was a point at which 
Sunny should reasonably have intervened and not permitted new drawdowns.
Miss C was permitted to make drawdowns up to her credit limit (initially £350) and repay 
them in up to five months. The facility had no specific end date set out in the contract as it 
was open-ended. But the loan agreement does say that the facility was "...unsuitable for 
supporting sustained borrowing over long periods, as it would be very expensive as a means 
of longer term borrowing." This reflects that, although flexible, the facility was still a high-cost 
short-term credit product.
Relevant regulations, including the consumer credit sourcebook (CONC) also required 
Sunny to monitor the account. CONC 6.2.1R (2) (b) said Sunny should consider "...the ability 
of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of the regulated credit 
agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end agreement, to make repayments 
within a reasonable period." Sunny also had to monitor the account for signs of financial 
difficulty.
Nine months had passed between Miss C opening the account and requesting the 
drawdown of 10/12/2014. Miss C had reduced her balance to zero five times prior to this 
request, most recently on 25 July 2014. Miss C then made new drawdowns up to her credit 
limit shortly after this, in August. The December 2014 drawdown took Miss C back to her 
credit limit.
I don't think Sunny ought to have permitted Miss C to make the December 2014 drawdown. I 
appreciate Sunny's points that on the basis of its 'pounds and pence' affordability calculation 
the repayments were affordable. But given the nature of the product, it wouldn't be fair or 
reasonable for Miss C to have indefinite access to this high-cost facility. So there has to 
come a point at which Sunny fairly and reasonably ought to have ensured Miss C was going 
to reduce and then end her indebtednesses to it, within a reasonable timeframe. As I said, 
Miss C had already had the facility for nine months - which would be extended further by this 
new drawdown. Further drawdowns after this point seem not to have been possible only 
because Sunny withdrew the flexible account product from all customers in December 2014.
That Miss C made new drawdowns after reducing her balance to zero on five occasions 
suggests she was likely to continue using the facility in this way. I think by the time of the 
December 2014 drawdown, Sunny had the opportunity to realise this. So I think this is a reasonable point at which Sunny ought to not have permitted further drawdowns. I'm 
therefore upholding the complaint about loan 1 in respect of this drawdown only.
Putting things right
For loan 1: Sunny should refund the interest and charges Miss C paid as a consequence of 
the drawdown of 10/12/2014. It should add 8% simple interest per year to this refund, from 
when the interest and charges were paid, until the date of settlement.
For loan 5: Sunny should rework the loan to remove all interest and charges applied and 
treat any payments as if they were paid towards the principal.
I understand this will likely leave an outstanding balance owed (for loans 4 and 5).
If, after Sunny has done the above, Miss C still owes Sunny something then Sunny can use 
the redress for loan 1 to reduce this balance. If, on the other hand, Miss C no longer owes 
Sunny anything, Sunny should refund the interest and charges for loan 5, adding 8% simple 
interest as described above.
Sunny should also remove any adverse information recorded about loan 5.
If Sunny has sold the outstanding loans, it should buy them back if it can. If it can't buy them 
back, it should liaise with the new owner to achieve the results above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part. Elevate Credit International Limited must put things right by 
taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2020.
