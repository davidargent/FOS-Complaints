K820x#14complaint
Mr J, through a Claims Management Company  (CMC),  complains National Westminster  
Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold a Select Silver  packaged bank account to him. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Js complaint and didnt think NatWest  had mis-sold the 
packaged account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Js complaint. 
Free accounts  are widely available in the United Kingdom (UK)  and the documentation     
Mr J signed, when he was sold his account, suggests that free accounts  were discussed with 
him. So overall I think Mr J wouldve known NatWest did free accounts and he couldve had 
one of those if she really wanted.
I dont think NatWest recommended  the Select  Silver account to Mr J. So he needed to 
decide whether  it was right for him. As far as I can see, Mr J couldve used the benefits and 
it was up to him to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Mr J wasnt told absolutely everything he needed to know about 
the account. But Ive not seen anything to suggest  he wouldve been affected  by the main 
limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a difference and 
I think Mr J was given enough to know and understand what  he was agreeing to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Js complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2019.
