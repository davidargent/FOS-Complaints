The complaint
Mr N complains that Capital One (Europe) plc wont refund to him the £236.35 that hes been 
charged by a car hire company. 
What happened
Mr N hired a car to use when he was on holiday in another country in August and September 
2020. The hire car was stolen, which he reported to the police, but was then found and 
collected by the car hire company. A charge of £236.65 was taken from his Capital One 
credit card by the car hire company which was for collecting the car and petrol. He accepts 
liability for the petrol but not the collection charge.
He claimed a refund from Capital One under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but 
it said that it was unable to accept his section 75 claim. Mr N wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that Capital 
One hadnt made a chargeback claim but he didnt think that it was unreasonable that it 
didnt attempt a chargeback and considered his claim under section 75. He said that Mr N 
had signed the terms and conditions for hiring the car and didnt agree that there had been a 
breach of contract or a misrepresentation by the car hire company  so he didnt think that 
Capital One had acted unfairly by declining his section 75 claim. Mr N hadnt received an 
invoice for the charges but he didnt think that that had affected his complaint or his claim.
Mr N has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that his contract was made with the car hire company when he made his booking and there 
was no mention at that time of a charge if the car was stolen. He says that the additional 
terms that the car hire company seeks to impose were not agreed upon at the time that the 
contract was made so form no part of the agreement and its in breach of contract by 
insisting on the payment for the recovery of the car.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Mr N had signed the car hire companys terms and conditions when he collected the 
car and I consider that any chargeback claim would have been successfully 
defended by the car hire company so there wasnt a reasonable prospect of a claim 
being successful  and I dont consider that Capital One acted incorrectly by not 
making a chargeback claim in these circumstances; 
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ns complaint about Capital One, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the car hire company and 
that Capital Ones response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ns claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mr N signed the car hire companys terms and conditions when he collected the car 
and although he wasnt aware of those terms and conditions when he booked the 
car, he signed them and continued with the car hire;
I consider that he accepted the terms and conditions when he signed them and Im 
not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable to say that those terms and 
conditions didnt apply to the car that he was hiring;
the car was stolen, Mr N reported that to the police and the car was then found and 
collected and Mr N was charged a total of £236.35 which included a charge for petrol 
which he doesnt dispute;
Capital One says that the terms and conditions say that the car hire company
 may take any sums owed by me under this rental agreement from my credit card 
including any excess payable for loss/damage of the vehicle;
although I understand that there was no damage to the car, I dont consider that it 
was unfair or unreasonable for the car hire company to charge Mr N for recovering 
the car, and any other associated costs, after it had been stolen;
Mr N says that he hasnt been provided with an invoice for the charges  but thats 
not something for which I consider Capital One to be responsible  and I consider 
that he should get the invoice from the car hire company if he wants a copy of it  but 
Im not persuaded that his claim to Capital One has been affected by there being no 
invoice for the charges; 
although I sympathise with Mr N for the difficulties that hes experienced as a result 
of the hire car being stolen, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the car hire company 
and I consider that Capital Ones response to his section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Capital One to refund to 
Mr N any part of the £236.35 that hes been charged by the car hire company, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 June 2021.
