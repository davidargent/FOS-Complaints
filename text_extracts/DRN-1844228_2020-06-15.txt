The complaint
Ms B complains about problems shes had with her National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) current account. Shes also complained about the service NatWest provided on 
multiple occasions. 
What happened
Ms B has provided detailed accounts of her experience with NatWest, and whilst I can 
reassure both parties that Ive taken these into account, my role allows me to focus on what I 
consider to be the crux of the matter. As a result, Ive focussed on what I consider to be the 
main issues. Ive summarised these below.
Ms B opened a current account with NatWest in 2019. In order to open the account a mobile 
phone number was required  this was to ensure authorisation for online transactions could 
be given, if needed. Ms B didnt have a mobile phone, so NatWest input a dummy number to 
ensure the account could be opened.
Since then Ms B has attempted to make several online transactions, which she says often 
cant be completed because a one-time passcode is required. The passcode is sent to the 
mobile number that NatWest has on record  which isnt Ms Bs number. Ms B says she has 
raised this issue with NatWest on several occasions and nothing has been done about it. 
She says this has caused her significant distress and worry as she relies on ordering things 
online.
Ms B has also raised concerns about her card being blocked when she uses it in store. She 
says this has caused her embarrassment because on a couple of occasions shes had to 
ask a friend to make a payment, or shes had to use cash. She says that NatWest hasnt 
been very helpful in resolving this issue.
Because Ms B was having trouble using her card and making online transactions, so she 
arranged to visit a local NatWest branch to withdraw a cash lump sum. When she got to the 
branch, she was asked numerous questions about the cash withdrawal. Ms B had a friend 
with her at the time, and she says both were treated unfairly and at times the bank staff were 
discriminatory towards her. She couldnt make the cash withdrawal, so instead she used a 
cash machine to take out a significantly lower amount. Ms B says the whole ordeal caused 
her to become very unwell and she says NatWest treated her like a criminal.
Lastly, since opening the account Ms B says that on numerous occasions, she has 
requested paper statements  but when she logs into her online banking its defaulted to 
online statements. She says shes contacted NatWest about this, but the issue hasnt been 
resolved, and they still havent provided her with the paper statements she requires.
Ms B complained to NatWest directly about most of these issues. NatWest issued several 
responses to Ms B, but in summary they didnt think theyd done anything wrong. They 
DRN-1844228explained that when Ms B attended the branch to make a large cash withdrawal, they had 
concerns that she may have been a victim of a scam, so they took the necessary 
precautions to avoid this. They also said they werent discriminatory towards her and where 
possible they made the adjustments required to ensure she was treated fairly.
They also said that when they checked Ms Bs records to see if shed opted in for paper 
statements, they werent able to see shed made this request. But, moving forwards they 
would be happy to provide her with the statements she required.
Unhappy with NatWests response, Ms B brought her complaint to this service. At this point 
NatWest hadnt provided a final response to Ms B about her concerns with the online 
transactions - so our investigator considered this under our early consent rule. He also 
considered whether NatWest had acted fairly and reasonably in response to Ms Bs other 
complaint points. 
The investigator thought that on the whole NatWest had done enough to sort things out for 
Ms B. He thought theyd followed the necessary process when Ms B visited the branch and 
he didnt think theyd been unreasonable in the way theyd treated her. But he did think that 
they couldve removed the dummy mobile number on her account sooner and this wouldve 
avoided further issues with online transactions. He recommended that NatWest pay £100 for 
the delay in removing this and to recognise the inconvenience this caused Ms B. He also 
asked them to change the authorisation number to her landline number and he asked them 
to send paper statements to Ms B.
NatWest agreed to pay £100 for the inconvenience caused, change the authorisation 
number to Ms Bs landline and to send the paper statements. Ms B disagreed. Because an 
agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusions as the investigator for broadly the same 
reasons.
Problems making transactions online and in store
NatWest has explained that a mobile phone number is required to open a current account. 
This is to ensure they can authorise online transactions if they need to. They introduced this 
in response to regulatory changes that came into force in 2019 which required businesses to 
introduce stronger customer authentication when making payments or transfers online.
Ms B didnt have a mobile phone when she was opening the account, so they input a dummy 
mobile number. However, this shouldve been removed after the account was opened. 
Because they didnt do this, Ms B hasnt always been able to authorise online transactions  
because the passcode is sent to a mobile number that doesnt exist.
I can understand Ms Bs frustration with the issues shes faced when trying to make online 
transactions. I wont go into the details of each time shes had problems, but I can appreciate 
its caused her inconvenience. 
Since raising her concerns with us, NatWest has agreed it shouldve removed the dummy 
mobile number sooner and it shouldve made her landline number the default for authorisation codes. Its agreed to do this going forwards and its agreed to pay £100 in 
recognition of the inconvenience caused  I think this is fair in the circumstances.
I understand Ms B has also had some issues with account being blocked because the 
incorrect PIN was entered. Ive seen correspondence between NatWest and Ms B about 
how she can unblock her account. I think NatWest has provided a clear explanation of what 
she needs to do, so I dont think it needs to do anything more in the circumstances
the cash withdrawal in branch and the service provided
Before attending the branch, Ms B checked that she could make a lump sum cash 
withdrawal over the counter. The morning she was due to visit she received a call from an 
adviser at NatWest, who wanted to discuss the withdrawal with Ms B. From the notes 
provided by NatWest I can see that Ms B ended the call because she didnt want to discuss 
it over the phone. 
When Ms B got to the branch, she said she was interrogated about the withdrawal and what 
she wanted to spend the money on. She said that she was treated unfairly and that she was 
kept at the branch much longer than required. Shes also said that NatWest discriminated 
against her and her friend. 
I would point out here that its not my role to say whether or not NatWest has acted 
unlawfully or discriminated against Ms B - thats for a court to decide. My role is to decide 
whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
NatWest has provided records of their version of events and email exchanges and reports 
from the bank manager. These suggest the branch manager was concerned about the cash 
withdrawal Ms B was trying to make for several reasons, but specifically they were worried 
she was potentially being scammed. Theyve said they have a duty of care to their 
customers and theyve explained what steps they might take if they have concerns about 
activity on an account. Because Ms B was reluctant to answer the questions and they 
remained concerned - NatWest contacted the police.
Taking into consideration Ms Bs account of what happened and NatWests - I think that its 
more likely than not that NatWest was following its processes and just wanted to ensure Ms 
B wasnt being coerced into doing something she didnt want to do. 
I dont doubt the manager of the branch mightve asked Ms B numerous questions about Ms 
her account and I can appreciate that she was concerned when the police arrived  but Im 
satisfied NatWest was acting in her best interests. And I dont think they treated her unfairly 
by doing this. As a result, I dont think NatWest needs to do anything more.
requesting paper statements
Ms B has said that shes continuously had to opt in for paper statements, rather than online 
statements, but she doesnt receive them in the post. And when she logs into her online 
banking it has defaulted back to online statements.
NatWest has said its checked its records and it cannot see when Ms B has opted in for 
paper statements. 
Im not aware of this being a known issue with NatWests online banking platform, so it may 
be that Ms B thought she was opting in for paper statements, but she wasnt.In any event NatWest has agreed to send her paper statements for the period she has asked 
for. This seems fair in the circumstances and moving forwards NatWest should change the 
default to paper statements, so Ms B doesnt have to continue asking for them.
multiple occasions of poor service
Im aware that Ms B has had many interactions with NatWest. I should explain that complaint 
handling isnt a regulated activity  so I cant comment on the way NatWest responded to Ms 
Bs complaints. This service resolves complaints with minimal formality, so I havent 
considered the customer service NatWest provided in minute detail. Instead, Ive considered 
things in the round.
Having reviewed Ms Bs correspondence with NatWest I understand how strongly she feels 
about this matter. In her view she has had many issues with her current account which 
NatWest hasnt helped her with. From what Ive seen and heard Im satisfied NatWest dealt 
with Ms B in a professional manner and responded to contact from her appropriately. And as 
Ive said, I cant comment on the way her complaints were handled.
In summary, I think the customer service Ms B received from NatWest was satisfactory.
Overall 
I understand my decision may not be the answer Ms B was hoping for, but I hope it gives her 
some reassurance that Ive taken her complaint seriously. Having read her correspondence I 
can see that shes very frustrated and upset with the way NatWest has treated her. But 
having looked at everything in the round, I think NatWest has done enough to explain to Ms 
B what she needs to do to resolve things, or they have put things right for her. But I do 
agree, they shouldve removed the dummy mobile number from her record sooner. 
Putting things right
National Westminster Bank Plc should do the following:
remove the dummy mobile number from Ms Bs record and register the landline
number for authorisation codes;
pay £100 compensation to Ms B; and
opt Ms B in for paper statements going forwards
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding this complaint. 
I require National Westminster Bank Plc to do what I've set out under the heading 'Putting 
things right'.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.Rachel Killian
