DRN-1958155
Complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) policy taken out 
in 2008. Mr and Mrs S say Santander UK plc, trading at the time as Abbey, mis-sold this 
cover to them.
Ill refer mainly to Santander for consistency.
Background
I issued a provisional decision in May 2020, setting out why I thought the complaint shouldnt 
be upheld. And I asked both parties to provide any further submissions or information to me 
by 23 June 2020 at the latest. That decision should be read in conjunction with this final 
decision.
My findings
We havent had any responses from the parties, so Im interpreting that as neither wanting to 
send in any new information or arguments. Nevertheless, Ive provided a little extra time and 
also thoroughly reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done this, theres no reason 
for me to change the findings. 
As I said in my provisional decision, there appears to me to be solid and reliable evidence 
that MPPI protection was probably discussed at the time of the sale and that it was portrayed 
as an optional product with several permutations about who and what might be protected 
under the policy rules. I therefore think the proper consent was most likely obtained to add 
the MPPI to the mortgage.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr and Mrs S.
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint. And dont require Santander UK plc to pay any 
compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 July 2018.
