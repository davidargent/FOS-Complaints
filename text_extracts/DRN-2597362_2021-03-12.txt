The complaint
Miss D complains that NewDay Ltd incorrectly cancelled her credit card. She says it didnt 
provide correct information and caused her ill health.
What happened
In mid- 2019, Miss D phoned NewDay after falling behind on her credit card repayments. 
She explained she was experiencing financial difficulties and was in hospital because of 
issues relating to her mental health. She said she was struggling to speak on the phone 
because of the medication she was on and would prefer to communicate by email. NewDay 
sent Miss D an income and expenditure (I&E) form to complete. 
A few weeks later Miss D phoned NewDay to ask for help completing the I&E form. She was 
told her account had been closed due to non-payment and the account being 60 days in 
arrears. Miss D was surprised to learn that the account had been closed because shed 
been given 30 days to complete the I&E form and she was still within this timeframe. She 
complained that she was given incorrect information leading to the closure of her account. 
NewDay said it had followed the correct process when terminating Miss Ds account and it 
couldnt be re-opened. It said Miss Ds earlier phone call wasnt recorded but it couldnt see 
any notes to show that an I&E form had been sent to her. It credited £40 to her account to 
compensate her for trouble and upset.
Miss D remained unhappy, so she asked our service to look into her complaint. Our 
investigator didnt think NewDay was wrong to close Miss Ds account. But she thought it 
should have communicated with her more clearly in light of her health issues. She 
recommended NewDay pay Miss D an additional £100 to compensate her for the distress 
and inconvenience caused. 
NewDay disagreed with our investigators view. It said the £40 compensation it had 
previously awarded was because the complaint handler hadnt seen that an I&E form had 
been sent to Miss D. This was incorrect but no further action was taken as the decision had 
been in Miss Ds favour. It didnt agree that it had given Miss D unclear information about the 
account being terminated. NewDay said it felt it had treated Miss D sympathetically and 
would only be willing to consider awarding higher compensation if documentary evidence of 
her mental health issues was provided.
Our investigator said the compensation shed recommended was based on the I&E form not 
being sent. As this had been sent, she thought a total of £100 compensation would be fair 
and recommended NewDay pay Miss D £60 in addition to what it had previously paid. 
Miss D agreed with our investigators view. But NewDay didnt agree that additional 
compensation was warranted. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has a responsibility to treat its customers fairly and communicate with them in a 
way which is clear, fair and not misleading. 
The terms and conditions relating to Miss Ds credit agreement with NewDay say: You must 
pay at least your contractual minimum payment each month. I can see that NewDay sent 
Miss D several letters regarding the arrears on her account and on 13 August 2019, it sent 
her a default notice which said she needed to pay £126.72 by 3 September 2019. It said that 
if she didnt pay before this date NewDay would terminate your credit agreement with us, 
close your credit card account and ask you to pay the full account balance immediately
I cant say it was unreasonable for NewDay to have terminated Miss Ds credit agreement. 
She hadnt kept up with her contractual minimum payments. NewDay had also made her 
aware that shed breached the agreement and the potential consequences of doing so. 
Miss D has accepted our investigators view on this, but she remains unhappy about how 
NewDay has communicated with her. While shes willing to accept the compensation our 
investigator recommended, NewDay hasnt agreed to pay it. So, Ive gone on to consider this 
part of Miss Ds complaint.
Miss D says that when she spoke to NewDay in August 2019, she said she would be out of 
the country in early September and would send back the I&E form on her return. She says 
she was told this was fine and no other dates were mentioned other than having 30 days to 
complete the form.
NewDay says a 30 day hold was placed on the account for breathing space, allowing   
Miss D to complete the I&E form without receiving collection calls. It didnt prevent the 
accrual of arrears. The termination notice was automatically issued by NewDays system on 
5 September 2019 once the arrears had reached a certain level. NewDay says it advised 
Miss D of the implications of not making payment towards the account in the default notice 
letter of 13 August 2019 and she would also have been advised of this in the calls that took 
place at the time.  
Its unfortunate that NewDay isnt able to provide a recording of the telephone call that took 
place in August 2019. The notes on NewDays systems are brief so its difficult to know 
exactly what was said. But there isnt anything to show that NewDay told Miss D that the 
credit card agreement would be terminated if she didnt bring the account up to date before 5 
September. And Im persuaded by Miss Ds testimony that she was given the impression 
that nothing further would happen within the 30 day period she had to complete the I&E 
form. 
I appreciate Miss D was previously given information about the possible termination of the 
credit agreement in the default notice that was sent to her on 13 August 2019. But I think she 
would have paid more attention to what she was told verbally when she phoned to discuss 
the arrears on the account. 
Although NewDays call notes are brief, they detail what Miss D said about her mental health 
condition. So, Im satisfied that NewDay was aware that Miss D was vulnerable. In light of 
this, I think it was even more important for NewDay to make sure Miss D clearly understood 
what was going to happen next.
On balance, I dont think NewDay did enough to make its process clear to Miss D. And I 
think this was particularly distressing for Miss D, given her mental health condition.I think it would be fair for NewDay to pay Miss D a total of £100 to compensate her for the 
trouble and upset shes experienced. This means it should pay her £60 in addition to the £40 
it previously awarded her.
Putting things right
NewDay should pay Miss D £60 for trouble and upset.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Ds complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put 
things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 April 2021.
