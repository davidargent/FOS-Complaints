K821x#15complaint
Ms T complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, (QQ)  and Pounds  to 
Pocket, (P2P), gave  her loans that she couldnt  afford to repay.  The complaint has been  
brought to this service on Ms Ts behalf by a claims management company. But for
ease I shall refer below to all actions being  taken  by Ms T.
background
Ms T was given four payday  loans and a flex credit account by QQ between  June  2011  and
March 2017. And P2P gave her eight  instalment  loans and a refinance  loan between
November 2011  and April 2018. Most of the instalment loans (except  Loans  8 and 9) were
repayable by 12 monthly instalments. Loan  8 was repayable by 11 monthly  instalments  and
Loan 9 was repayable by 10 monthly instalments.  All the loans have been repaid. A
summary of the loans  taken out by Ms T is shown  below:

CashEuroNet didnt  consent to Loans 1 to 4 being  considered and Ms T agreed to withdraw
these from her complaint.
CashEuroNet said in its response to this service  that it could have been more  diligent
granting flex credit (Loan 6) drawdowns  starting on 23 March  2014 due to the number of
drawdowns being requested. So it offered to refund all interest and charges paid on the
drawdowns starting on 3 November 2014 and pay 8% interest  on those refunds and remove
Ref: DRN91065592adverse entries  about Loan  6 from Ms Ts credit  file.
Ms T rejected CashEuroNets offer.
our adjudicators view
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint  should be upheld  in part. It appears  that
her numbering of the loans  had omitted  the loan Ive referred to as Loan 4. So using my
numbering, the adjudicator recommended that the complaint about Loans 6, 7 and 10
onwards be upheld.
CashEuroNet disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that it had evaluated the loans
with a proportionate and thorough affordability  assessment and didnt  believe  there  was a
chain of dependency. It said that there was nothing in its credit checks  to suggest that Ms T
would have trouble meeting her repayments.  CashEuroNet had also said that starting  from
1 March 2015 (which  was before Ms T borrowed Loan 7 and onwards), it had implemented
an affordability assessment that was consistent with the FCA Handbook.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms T 
and to CashEuroNet on 14 June 2019. I summarise  my findings:
Id noted that Ms T had withdrawn her complaint about Loans  1 to 4. However,  Id still 
included them in the table above, because although  Ms T had withdrawn her complaint 
about these loans, they formed  part of her borrowing history with CashEuroNet.  So I 
proposed to take Loans 1 to 4 into account when  assessing Loans 5 and 6.
When CashEuroNet first lent to Ms T the regulator was the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT)  and
relevant guidance included  its guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). From 1 April 2014
onwards the regulator was the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) and relevant regulations
and guidance  included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC
contained similar guidance  for lenders about responsible lending.
With regard to CashEuroNets  assessments  after 1 March 2015, I said that this service had 
addressed this specific point by CashEuroNet in previous decisions. I reminded 
CashEuroNet of the FCA guidance  on how complaints  are to be dealt with promptly and 
fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which  says that 
businesses procedures for complaint handling should 
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in
the respondent.
Ref: DRN91065593So I said that my decision  would focus  on the specifics of Ms Ts complaint and what both 
parties had said about  this.
I noted that CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to 
make sure Ms T could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I thought  less thorough  checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But I said that certain factors might point  to the fact that CashEuroNet should fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These factors included:
-the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
       any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
-the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
       meet a higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
-the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
       during which a customer  had been given  loans (reflecting  the risk that repeated
       refinancing might signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
       unsustainable).
There might  even come a point where the lending  history  and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought that it was important for me to say that CashEuroNet was required to
establish whether  Ms T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
I noted that the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow  this 
was the case.  This was because the CONC defines sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the consumer  should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it followed that a lender should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context and what this all meant for Ms Ts complaint.
CashEuroNet had done a number of checks before  it lent to Ms T. It had asked her for 
details of her income. From Loan  7 it had also asked about Ms Ts expenditure. 
CashEuroNet also checked Ms Ts employment and housing status. From the information 
CashEuroNet gathered, Ms T was employed and paid rent.
CashEuroNet had also checked Ms Ts credit file before  agreeing to the loans. CashEuroNet 
hadnt provided us with the results of its credit checks. But Ms T had provided us with her 
credit report.
Ref: DRN91065594Loans 5 and 6
As Id said above,  I proposed to take Loans  1 to 4 into account when assessing Loans  5 and
6. Id noted that by Loan 5, Ms T had been  borrowing almost continuously and mostly in 
quick succession from CashEuroNet. Id noted that there was a gap of around six months 
between Loans  4 and 5. But I didnt  think it would have been reasonable for CashEuroNet to 
have seen this gap as an indication that Ms Ts finances had moved on from whatever 
situation had required her previous loans. There had been an established  period  of 
borrowing before  Loan 5 which I thought CashEuroNet ought  to have been concerned about 
irrespective of the length of pause between Loans  4 and 5.
And Id looked  at the overall pattern of the lending  chain  since Loan 1 to see if there  was a
point at which CashEuroNet should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should have realised that it
shouldnt have provided any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ts
case, I thought  that this point had been  reached  by Loan 5 in this chain of lending. By 
Loan 4, Ms T had been  borrowing almost continuously and in quick succession  from 
CashEuroNet. Loan 3 was borrowed on the same day that Loan  2 was repaid and Loan  4 
was borrowed on the same day that Loan  3 was repaid.
I noted that the amounts  Ms T was borrowing had been mostly increasing and CashEuroNet  
ought to have realised it was likely  her indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably. By the 
time Ms T asked  for Loan  5 shed been  borrowing from CashEuronet  for almost 23 months 
and she wasnt making any inroads into the amount she owed the lender. By that time Ms T 
had paid a considerable  amount  of interest  to CashEuroNet to effectively service  a debt over 
an extended period.
And as Id said above, although there was a gap of around six months between the
repayment of Loan  4 and Loan 5, I didnt  think it would have been reasonable for
CashEuroNet in Ms Ts circumstances to conclude this was an indication  that Ms Ts
finances had moved  on from whatever situation  had required her previous loans.
So I proposed to uphold Ms Ts complaint about Loans 5 and 6.
Loans 7 onwards
There was a gap of almost three years between when Ms T repaid Loan 6 (the flex-credit
account) and when  she took out Loan 7. And I thought this was significant enough a gap to
constitute a break in the chain of lending. So I didnt think that Loans 7 onwards  formed part 
of the same  pattern of lending  Id referred  to above in terms of Loans 1 to 6.
However, while there had been this gap in lending, the amount Ms T came back  to borrow  at
the time of Loan 7 was still significant.  The loan was for £600 and repayable  over three
instalments with a highest instalment of £739.20.
CashEuroNet had said it searched Ms Ts credit file before  approving this loan although it 
hadnt provided the results of its check.  But CashEuronet did tell this service  that there was 
nothing in its credit checks to suggest that Ms T would have trouble meeting  her 
repayments. But I could  see from the credit file Ms T had provided to this service that she 
had been made bankrupt around eight months before Loan 7 was provided, and the 
bankruptcy order had not yet been discharged  when  shed applied for Loan 7. Id thought 
Ref: DRN91065595CashEuroNets search of Ms Ts credit file at this time would likely have shown this. So I 
thought it wouldve been reasonable for CashEuroNet to take its checks  further. I thought  it 
shouldve wanted  to complete a full review  of her financial circumstances including verifying 
some of the information  shed provided for Loan  7 as well as her subsequent loans. I 
couldnt see that it had done  this.
Had it done so, its likely  that CashEuroNet wouldve learnt that Ms T was borrowing from
several lenders  at the same  time as she was borrowing from CashEuroNet. So additional
short term lending was likely to be unaffordable  for her. So I thought CashEuroNet ought to
have realised it was unlikely Ms T wouldve been able to sustainably  repay  Loan  7. And I 
thought for the same reasons as set out above  for Loan 7 that CashEuroNet should have put 
together a clearer picture of Ms Ts finances  before agreeing to lend to her going
forwards. And if CashEuroNet  had carried out proportionate checks before  Loans 8 to 10, it
would have seen  that Ms T was borrowing from multiple lenders at the same  time. So she
was having difficulties in managing her money.  So I didnt think that CashEuroNet should
have lent Loans  7 to 10 to Ms T.
Id looked at the overall pattern of lending to see if there was a point at which  CashEuroNet
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful.
And so CashEuroNet should have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further
lending.
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ts case, I thought that this point was reached by
Loan 11. I said this because  by the time CashEuroNet lent Ms T loan 11, shed been
borrowing continuously for around  a year without any significant  breaks  in the lending.
Loan 8 was borrowed on the same  day that Loan 7 was repaid, Loan 10 was borrowed on
the same  day that Loan 9 was repaid and Loan  11 was taken out on the same  day that
Loan 10 was repaid.  Loan 9 followed the payment of Loan 8 by just a few days. And so Ms T 
wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed CashEuroNet, and was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period.
By the time Ms T had repaid Loan 13, shed had continuous borrowing from CashEuroNet  
for around  13 months.
I thought the need for Ms T to borrow again  so quickly  after repaying each loan and for that
period of time suggested that she wasnt using the loans for their intended purpose of short
term cash flow but was likely using the loans  to substitute her income.
I thought that Ms T lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from
Loan 11 onwards  because:
-these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ts indebtedness by allowing  her
       to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time.
-the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on
       Ms Ts ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the market for these
       high-cost loans.
So I also upheld Ms Ts complaint about  Loans  11 onwards because  the overall pattern
of lending increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful
and shed lost out as a result. The fact that the loans were  repaid didnt mean  that they
were repaid  sustainably, or without causing Ms T undue difficulty.
Ref: DRN91065596Id also considered the points CashEuroNet made in response to the adjudicators view. 
CashEuroNet said that it had evaluated  the loans with a proportionate and thorough  
affordability assessment  and didnt believe there  was a chain  of dependency.  But, I said that
CashEuroNet would  know from previous decisions (as well as whats set out on our website)
that there  were cases where this service  considered  the overall lending pattern and not just 
the affordability of each  loan. When a consumer borrowed numerous loans over a long 
period of time, it was most likely  that the loans  werent being  used for their intended purpose 
of temporary cash flow problems.
Subject to any further representations by Ms T or CashEuroNet  my provisional decision  was 
that I intended to uphold  this complaint in part. I intended to order CashEuroNet  UK LLC, 
trading as QuickQuid  and Pounds  to Pocket, to:
-refund  all interest and charges Ms T paid on Loans 5 to 13;
-pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
       they  were paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement*;
-remove any adverse entries about Loans  5 to 10 from Ms Ts credit  file;
-the number  of loans taken from Loan 11 onwards meant  any information recorded
       about them is adverse. So all entries  about  Loan 11 onwards  should be removed
       from  Ms Ts credit file.
*CashEuroNet must give Ms T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks
for one.
Ms T responded to my provisional decision to say that she was happy  with the decision.
CashEuroNet responded by providing this service  with a document which  is titled  CEU 
Lending Criteria and Proportionate Checks to show its entire lending process. CashEuroNet 
also said, in summary, that Ms T had a sound  repayment history and that she had incurred 
only three late fees. It said that Ms T didnt  exhibit a reliance on the loans.  There were 
substantial breaking  periods  of between 183 and 1016 days  between some  of the loans. It 
also said that there was a discrepancy between its credit check  and what  Ms Ts credit 
report showed. It provided a summary  of its credit  check from 1 March 2017.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet provided this service with a document which is titled  CEU Lending Criteria and 
Proportionate Checks, which I note isnt case-specific. This service has responded to 
CashEuroNets submission of this document on many previous occasions  and so Ill say no 
more about it here. But I have taken its contents into account.
CashEuroNet said that Ms T had a sound repayment history with only three late fees. But I 
think CashEuroNet will (or ought to) know from previous decisions that this service considers 
there will be times when the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate that a consumer is 
likely to be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should relending continue.  
So it follows  that successful  repayment  of a loan doesnt automatically  mean  it was repaid 
sustainably.
Ref: DRN91065597CashEuroNet has also referred to gaps in its lending. I had already taken the gaps between 
the loans into account when reaching  my provisional  findings and referred  to these in my
provisional decision. I also note that there  were  barely any gaps in lending  from Loan 7.
I acknowledge that the amounts Ms T borrowed fluctuated, but I think  its fair to say there
was a broad  upwards trend. Only two of Ms Ts last eight  loan amounts  were less than her
first three loans. Although the amounts  Ms T borrowed varied, I think CashEuroNet acted
unfairly by allowing Ms T to take expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an
extended period  of time.
When a consumer borrows  numerous  loans over a long period of time, its most likely that 
the loans arent being used for their intended purpose of temporary cash  flow problems. As 
CashEuroNet will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter  to CEOs of high cost lending 
firms that a high volume of relending..may  be symptomatic  of unsustainable lending 
patters. And I think that is the case here.
CashEuroNet also provided a summary  of its credit check before Loan 7. But I note that the 
summary didnt contain any reference as to whether there had been bankruptcy proceedings 
which I would normally expect to see in a credit check. So I cant be certain as to what  
CashEuroNet would  have  known about  this before  Loan 7. 
Overall, CashEuroNet  hasnt said anything that persuades me that the outcome I reached in 
my provisional decision was unreasonable or incorrect.  So my final decision is the same  as I
outlined in my provisional decision and for the same reasons.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket, to:
-refund  all interest and charges Ms T paid on Loans 5 to 13;
-pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
       they  were paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement*;
-remove any adverse entries about Loans  5 to 10 from Ms Ts credit  file;
-the number  of loans taken from Loan 11 onwards meant  any information recorded
       about them is adverse. So all entries  about  Loan 11 onwards  should be removed
       from  Ms Ts credit file.
*CashEuroNet must give Ms T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks
for one.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 August 2019.
