The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA gave him no notice that an upcoming 
payment was due, and then didnt explain an interest charge to him when he asked about it.
What happened
Mr A has borrowed money from PayPal credit. He said that he was charged for doing this,
when he didnt expect to be.
Mr A forwarded us an email chain between him and PayPal. He said that hed spoken to
someone at PayPal about a hard copy statement that he received, which showed an interest
payment of £10.40. He said PayPal had dismissed his concerns, saying that it was a
perfectly legitimate charge even before looking at the details. And he said PayPal hadnt
been able to explain why he had been charged the interest.
Mr A showed us an email hed sent, which said PayPal claimed that this interest had been
incurred in the period between the end of his agreed payment holiday and the next payment.
Mr A said that if this was right, then PayPal had failed to remind him in time to make the
payment, because he always makes his payment in full by direct debit, and that means he
doesnt incur interest charges.
Mr A said hed complained, and received a series of responses which all seemed to consider
that the matter had been dealt with, but it hadnt. Then he got a final letter claiming the issue
had been resolved, but it still hadnt. So he wanted us to help.
PayPal said that Mr A was on a payment holiday for May, June and July. It said that no
interest was charged on his statements for those months, and it hadnt asked for any
payment on those statements either. But this payment holiday ended before his August
statement was issued. So it had started to charge Mr A interest again, once his payment
holiday had ended. PayPal said that Mr A did have an outstanding balance on his account.
PayPal said that its a customers responsibility to keep track of statements and interest
owed. And its a customers responsibility to be aware of when their payment holiday ceases
or expires.
PayPal said that £10.40 interest had been charged correctly on Mr As PayPal Credit
account. PayPal said it hadnt done anything wrong.
Our investigator said Mr As statement for 28 June 2020 to 27 June 2020 showed a balance
of £680.65, which he had until 21 August 2020 to pay off. Mr A didnt pay the balance off by
then, so the interest charge was then shown on his statement on 27 August 2020.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said she could sympathise
with Mr As concern that he wasnt reminded when he was going to be charged interest, but
she did think it would be up to him to check when his payment holiday was due to expire.
She said the interest was charged correctly, so she wouldnt ask PayPal to do any more.
Mr A didnt agree. He said we should have seen that he always pays his outstanding amount 
on time, and has never been late with any payments or incurred any fees. Mr A said there
was a pandemic, and he had a payment holiday. He said such times call for companies to be
clear and informative and to prompt their customers on time so as to avoid unnecessary
payments.
Mr A said PayPal doesnt actually issue statements, customers have to search for them on
their account. PayPal normally sends an email saying a payment is due, but he said he
didnt remember getting one of these, in this case. He wanted to know if wed seen an email
like this, because he thought this should have been sent.
Mr A also wanted us to consider what happened when he complained to PayPal about this.
He said that it didnt tell him what had happened. It gave responses that were indefinite and
vague. He said we needed to look at this.
Mr A said that usually a lender will look at a customers records, to see how theyve
managed the account in the past. If the previous history is ok and theres an explanation for
any recent problems, then the lender will refund the charge. But here, he said PayPal
wouldnt have this conversation with him.
Mr A said that PayPals statements were far from transparent and clear. He said we should
consider that weakness, and tell PayPal to do a better job.
Overall, Mr A said he thought we needed to take a deeper, more profound view of this case
and the many others like it that will have arisen recently. He wanted us to reassess his case.
Our investigator sent Mr A the statements on his account for July and August, and the
notifications from PayPal setting out that these statements were available for him to view.
Mr A said hed reviewed this, and he could now see that this charge of £10.40 was for
interest, not fees. But he said he didnt know where this statement could be found on his
account, which he said indicated the inadequacy of PayPal's communications.
Our investigator said that she thought Mr A had been sent a reminder by PayPal to say
statements were available to view. It was still his responsibility to keep an overview of his
account. And she hadnt seen any evidence that correspondence sent by PayPal was
unclear or confusing.
Our investigator said PayPal can refund charges or interest at its discretion, but it doesnt
have to, and she didnt feel she could ask it to here. She said that Mr A had raised a number
of issues about PayPals overall approach to providing information to customers, but she
could only look at his complaint with PayPal directly. We are a complaints service and not a
regulator, so we cant task PayPal with making general improvements.
As no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
I think a number of points have become clear as this case has progressed. Mr A 
wasnt charged a fee for a late payment. He was charged £10.40 in interest. This 
shows on his August statement.
So the issue isnt that Mr A paid late. He didnt. His July statement says no payment 
was due in August, and the August statement shows no payment was made. Thats 
consistent with what PayPal has told us, that Mr As payment holiday ended before 
his August statement was issued, so he wasnt paying any interest or being asked to 
make a monthly payment, until then.
Mr As August statement says that he was charged £10.40 in interest. This covers 
the time between when his payment holiday ended, and the next statement being 
issued.
Ive considered what Mr A has said about how difficult it was to get information on 
whats happened here. But I can see that the explanation Ive set out above, is what 
Mr A said he had been told when he first made his complaint to PayPal. So I do think 
PayPal told Mr A why hed been charged interest, when he first asked about this. I 
dont think it has been vague and unhelpful. And the account statements Ive seen 
dont seem to me to be unclear.
Mr A said that if he had been charged interest, then that was PayPals fault. I can see 
that he told PayPal I always make my payment in full by direct debit, and do not 
incur interest charges.
I know that PayPal didnt specifically forewarn Mr A that his payment holiday was 
coming to an end, and that it didnt ask for a payment in August. But Ive checked the 
status of Mr As account before he started his payment holiday, and although there 
was a direct debit on his account, it wasnt set up to pay the account off in full each 
month. The direct debit on his account was only set to pay the minimum. And I can 
see that he had only paid the minimum each month at the start of 2020, before his 
payment holiday started. So I dont think that its clear Mr A would otherwise have 
paid in full, in August, and avoided this interest charge.
Mr A said he didnt remember getting notifications from PayPal, telling him what was
happening on his account. Ive seen emails from PayPal, sent in July and August, 
telling Mr A that his monthly statements were available, so I think these were sent to 
him 
I can see that on the same day that Mr A was sent the notification for his August 
statement, he also amended his direct debit to pay off his account in full, each month.
Mr A says lenders can waive charges, if a customer has an explanation for whats 
gone wrong. And thats right, lenders can make a gesture of goodwill like this 
whenever they want to. But our service cant make a lender do this, where it hasnt 
been unreasonable or unfair. And I dont think I can ask PayPal to just waive the 
charge in this case.
I know that Mr A thinks that PayPals communications generally are poor, and that its 
difficult to see whats happening on his account. But, as our investigator said, we arent a regulator. I cant ask PayPal to make general service improvements. I can 
just look at what has happened in this case. Ive done that, and I dont think PayPal 
has been unreasonable or unfair.
I know that Mr A will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be 
upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal said it was happy with my decision, and it had nothing to add.
Mr A wrote to disagree. He said that he wanted to set out his case again, now that hed seen 
my views and my understanding of the issues. 
Mr A said hes a diligent credit card user who always pays the credit card payment in full by 
the due date. Mr A thought I was querying this because I said he had changed the amount 
paid to the minimum at one point. Mr A said he sometimes does this when theres an interest 
free period in play. He said that was the case at the time Id commented on, and he felt this 
showed he was a diligent credit card user.
Mr A said it was an indictment of PayPal's shoddiness that it didnt think it was necessary to 
pre-alert all of its customers about the particular circumstances of a payment holiday. Mr A 
said hed never encountered this before, and had no idea that interest would start to be 
charged before the technical end of the payment holiday. Mr A said if he had known that, he 
would have made the payment earlier.
Mr A said PayPal's overall communication was poor. He said he has a disability which is 
recognised in law, and he needs clear, detailed communication with stated deadlines and 
penalties. Mr A thought PayPal should make provision for the requirements of legally-
disabled people like himself, and provide good, clear, detailed communication. He said 
PayPal should do that for everyone. He repeated that much of what PayPal produced is 
confusing.
Mr A noted I now said, despite his testimony to the contrary, that PayPal told him in the first 
call what Id now set out about the amount of £10.40 being an interest payment that was 
charged, not a penalty. He said if that was right, why didnt he and our investigator realise 
what I had now pointed out for the first time in a way that makes sense and makes it clear? 
Mr A said he didnt know that he had been charged the interest until it was pointed out to him 
in the year end statement. He said PayPal did not explain to him the reasons for the charge, 
although I hadnt seemed to accept what hed said about this. 
Mr A said Id distinguished between the role of our service and that of the regulator. He 
wanted to know who has the power to tell PayPal to do what it should be doing for the 
benefit of its customers, and to look at wider issues affecting a number of customers.
Mr A said he hoped I would take account of what he had said, and would now reverse my 
decision to show solidarity with customers rather than PayPal and businesses like that.Id like to start by saying that it wouldnt really be appropriate for our service to seek to show 
solidarity with either businesses or complainants. Our role is to consider the arguments of 
both sides carefully, and to provide an independent, and impartial, complaint resolution 
service. With that in mind, Ive sought to balance out what happened here. 
I understand that Mr A feels that PayPals communications could have been much clearer. 
Hes explained that he needs clear communications because of the disability he has. I 
understand what Mr A says about this, and why this is particularly important to him. But I 
havent seen anything to suggest that hed told PayPal about this, or asked it to put special 
measures in place for him. What hes said is that PayPal should communicate clearly for the 
benefit of all of its customers. 
Mr A was surprised and disappointed to be charged interest on his PayPal balance. I accept 
that Mr A is usually very careful indeed to avoid this. And he said if PayPal had been clearer 
here, he could have made a payment onto his card. So Mr A says PayPal should have got in 
touch to warn him his payment holiday was ending. But PayPal said its Mr As responsibility 
to monitor this.
Mr A referred to the impact of the pandemic, and that is an issue I also have to consider 
here. Thats because, in this case, I also have to take account of the fact that PayPal didnt 
choose to implement payment holidays. It did so on an urgent basis, when the Financial 
Conduct Authority (PayPals regulator) instructed it and other lenders to offer additional 
support and flexibility to customers in the early stages of the pandemic. 
So the payment holiday wasnt something that PayPal had designed and refined carefully 
until it was ready to launch. It was something which was bolted on to PayPals systems 
urgently, to try to support customers in financial difficulties. 
With that in mind, although I do realise it would have been better customer service if PayPal 
had written to Mr A to say his payment holiday was about to end, I also dont think its 
automatically unfair or unreasonable if PayPal didnt do that, but relied on Mr A monitoring 
the position on his account. 
I also have to bear in mind what Mr A himself told us that PayPal had said to him. He does 
appear to me to have appreciated that this charge was for interest, and why it had been 
made, when he first raised this with PayPal. 
Mr A copied his email of complaint to us. That said this - 
I received a hardcopy statement today from you for the first time ever. There was an 
interest charge of £10.40 shown on it. 
I spoke to [a lady at PayPal, whom I wont name in this decision]. She said it related 
to the period between the end of my agreed Payment Holiday and the first payment. I 
said in that case PayPal had failed to remind me in time to make the payment as I 
always make my payment in full by direct debit, and do not incur interest charges. 
She said it related to the 27th Aug 2020 statement. 
I have looked at the payments for August and can only see an unrecognised item for 
£10. I cannot see any item for £10.40. Please investigate this and correct.
Thats why I thought that PayPal had correctly told Mr A this charge was for interest when he 
first contacted them. I know that Mr A didnt accept then that this payment was for interest, 
but he did set out then that PayPal had told him it was interest, and why the charge had 
been made, when he complained.And I dont think Mr As statements are unclear. Mr As August statement (issued on 27 
August 2020) shows this in the summary -
Fees and interest charges - £10.40.
Below this, the section titled Account Activity provides more detail. That says 
Interest - £10.40.
So I think that what PayPal has said now is consistent with what it said earlier. And I havent 
been able to see that its communications to Mr A were unclear.
Im sorry if Mr A has found earlier communications from our service less helpful in setting 
this out. But I can see that our investigator said From what Ive seen the interest was 
charged correctly on your PayPal credit account. So I think our investigator had also 
understood that this was an interest charge too.
I know that Mr A wants PayPal to do better in its communications in future. As our 
investigator explained, we only look at the individual complaint which is made to us. So I 
cant ask PayPal to make general service improvements for the future. And, having looked at 
what happened in this case, I dont think PayPal has been unfair or unreasonable. Although I 
know that Mr A will be disappointed, that means I havent changed my mind, and I still dont 
think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
