K820x#14The complaint  
Miss Ss complaint is about  the balance due on a finance agreement she has with FirstRand  
Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance (MotoNovo).
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties so I wont  repeat  them  again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons: 
MotoNovo sent a default notice on 26 December 2018  to the address we have for 
Miss S. Its the same address at which Miss S accepts she received a subsequent 
letter in February.  I therefore think its most likely that the letter was received and as 
Miss S didnt make contact with MotoNovo until that default had expired I dont think 
MotoNovo had to accept her voluntary termination.
On 7 February 2019 MotoNovo sent a letter to Miss S explaining we are prepared  
to offer a 20% reduction in the liability quoted if we receive your payment within 14 
days. The letter  didnt say that all of the payment would need to be received to 
qualify for the discount and I think Miss S would have been  likely to believe a part 
payment was sufficient  as further  on in the letter MotoNovo said if we do not receive  
a payment within the specified time. That would  suggest  to me that a payment 
would qualify for the discount not simply the full payment.
Miss S had until 21 February  to qualify for the 20% discount.  The DVLA  confirmed 
that the cars  ownership changed  on 18 February.  MotoNovo knew  this was going to 
be the case and it wasnt Miss Ss fault that the payment  didnt reach their account  in 
time for the discount to take effect. I think its fair to say that at the point Miss S sold 
the car the liability  for the payment of that sale to MotoNovo moved to the buyer. It 
was the buyer that MotoNovo would have had to pursue for that part of the debt had 
they not forwarded the payment to them. So I think Miss S settled £2,000 of her debt 
on 18 February, within the discount  period  and the discount should  therefore  have 
still been applied.
And, even if Im wrong  about  that, I think the delay in receiving  the payment was in 
part due to MotoNovos wording in the letter they sent to the buyers of the car. So 
they should have understood this was not Miss Ss fault and should have been more  
flexible with the date upon which the discount  would  apply. I would have expected 
MotoNovo to have  been more sympathetic given Miss Ss financial difficulties.
For these reasons, I uphold this complaint.  
Ref: DRN84767882My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint should be upheld. In order  to resolve Miss Ss 
complaint, FirstRand Bank  Limited should  reduce the outstanding liability  to £531.98 less 
anything Miss S may have subsequently  paid them.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 July 2020.
