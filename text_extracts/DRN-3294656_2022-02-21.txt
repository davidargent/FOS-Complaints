The complaint
Miss R complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the service they provided 
when she raised a dispute about items shed purchased from an online retailer.
What happened
On 22 September 2021, Miss R made a purchase of £40.58 for four items from an online 
retailer, who Ill refer to as X, using her PayPal account.
On 15 October, Miss R raised a claim under PayPals Buyer Protection Policy (BPP), stating 
the items she received were Significantly Not as Described. This is because Miss R had 
only received one of the four items, and the one item shed received was faulty.
On 9 November, PayPal advised Miss R she would need to return the item shed received to 
X, for a full refund to be issued. So, they asked Miss R to do this and provide them with 
tracking information before 19 November. Miss R didnt do this, so the claim was closed in 
Xs favour. But Miss R was unhappy with this, so she raised a complaint.
Miss R didnt think PayPal had acted fairly when declining her claim. She didnt think it was 
fair for PayPal to stipulate she return the one, faulty item in order to receive a refund for the 
three items she didnt receive. Miss R explained, due to the location of X, it would cost her 
around £26 in postage fees to send the one item back which she didnt think was reasonable 
when the full refund would only equate to just under £41. So, she wanted PayPal to refund 
her the amount shed paid as she thought X were a scam company, as highlighted in 
reviews shed found on the internet.
PayPal responded and didnt agree. They thought theyd acted fairly, processing the claim in 
line with the terms and conditions of the user agreement Miss R entered into. But they 
recognised Miss R remained unhappy so offered to credit her account with £41 as a gesture 
of good will in full and final settlement of her complaint. Miss R remained unhappy with this, 
so she referred her complaint to us.
As the complaint was referred to our service, PayPal confirmed the offer made in their 
complaint response was no longer valid.
Our investigator looked into the complaint about upheld it. They recognised PayPal hadnt 
disputed Miss Rs testimony that she only received one of four items. Or that the one item 
she did receive was faulty. So, our investigator didnt think PayPal had acted fairly when 
stating Miss R needed to return one item before receiving a refund for all four, even though 
this fell in line with the terms of the user agreement. They explained the cost of returning this 
one item was significant compared to the total refund she was looking for and they didnt 
think PayPal were reasonable to expect Miss R to incur this expense. So, they 
recommended PayPal refund Miss R the full claim total of £40.58 plus 8% interest from 9 
November 2021 until the date its paid to her to recognise the length of time shed been 
without these funds unfairly.
Miss R accepted this recommendation. But PayPal didnt. They maintained their view that 
theyd acted in line with the terms of the user agreement. So, they didnt think theyd acted 
unfairly or needed to do anything more. As PayPal didnt agree, the complaint has been 
passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
Im aware PayPal havent disputed Miss Rs testimony regarding the number of items she 
ordered, the number she received and the condition of those. Because of this, when 
considering the complaint and reaching my decision, I see no reason for me to dispute any 
of the facts presented within this testimony.
So, Im satisfied Miss R ordered four items from X, with a total value of £40.58. Neither 
PayPal nor Miss R have been able to provide me with an itemised breakdown of how much 
each item cost. And Im satisfied Miss R only received one of these items, which arrived 
faulty. 
So, Ive thought about whether I think PayPal have acted fairly when processing Miss Rs 
claim, considering these circumstances. And to do this, Ive thought about two things. First, 
Ive thought about whether PayPal have acted in line with the terms and conditions of their 
user agreement. And if I think they have, whether I think it was fair to do so. And on this 
occasion, I dont think it was.
PayPal have explained Miss R submitted her dispute as Significantly Not as Described. 
And theyve said this is the correct classification of claim, as Miss R did receive one of the 
items and so couldnt qualify as Item Not Received. 
As Miss R did receive one item, I dont think PayPal acted unfairly when classifying the claim 
in this way. And Ive seen PayPals user agreement which explains that, in claims of this 
nature, a customer must comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner. They 
go on to explain PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the 
seller. Its not in dispute that Miss R didnt do this so, I cant say PayPal acted outside of 
their terms and conditions when closing the claim in Xs favour.
But as Ive explained above, as well as considering whether PayPal acted in line with the 
terms and conditions of the user agreement, I also need to be satisfied they acted fairly 
when doing so. And I dont think PayPal did.
The terms of the BPP explain that it is PayPals sole discretion to determine whether a claim 
qualifies. So, I think PayPal had the ability to consider Miss Rs claim outside of the terms of 
the user agreement, if it was fair to do so.
And the term within the user agreement states that PayPal may require you, at your 
expense, to ship the item back to the seller. I think the term may is important here, as this 
suggests PayPal dont need to request a customer to do this in every claim. So, I think 
PayPal had the flexibility around this, to ensure a customer, in this case Miss R, is treated 
fairly.In this situation, Miss R hadnt received three of the four items she received. So, I dont think 
it was fair for PayPal to say Miss R needed to return one item, to secure a refund for the 
three she didnt have to return.
And due to the location of X, Ive seen the cost of returning this item to X wouldve been 
more than half of the total refund she wanted to claim back. And I dont think this is fair or 
reasonable. So, even though PayPals user agreement allowed them to take the decision 
they did, I dont think it was fair for them to do so. Because of this, Ive then thought about 
what I think PayPal should do to put things right.
Putting things right
Any direction or award I make is intended to place Miss R back in the position she wouldve 
been, had PayPal acted fairly. They arent designed to place Miss R in a position of 
betterment as my decision must be fair to both parties.
So, Ive thought about the position Miss R finds herself in. Its not in dispute that she is 
without three of the four items she ordered. Or that the one item she did receive is faulty. So, 
I dont think Miss R had received any item of value from X. 
Had PayPal acted fairly, I think they wouldve assessed Miss Rs claim and took into 
consideration her individual circumstances, including the cost of returning one faulty item to 
secure a full refund including the three items she didnt receive. And if they had acted 
reasonably, I wouldve expected PayPal to refund Miss Rs claim in full at that point, under 
the terms of the BPP. I can see PayPal asked Miss R to return the faulty item to X on 9 
November 2021. So, Im satisfied this is when they initially reviewed the claim, and this is 
when I think the claim shouldve been upheld for the full amount.
So, to place Miss R back in the position she wouldve been in, I think PayPal should refund 
Miss R the entire value of the claim, £40.58, plus 8% interest from 9 November 2021 to the 
date this payment is made. This takes into consideration the length of time Miss R has been 
without these funds unfairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Miss Rs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA and I direct them to take the following action:
Pay Miss R the full value of her disputed claim; and
Pay Miss R 8% interest on this amount from 9 November 2021 to the date of 
payment.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 March 2022.
