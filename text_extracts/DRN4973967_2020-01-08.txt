K820x#14complaint
Miss L complains about National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest)  regarding  the business  
indicating that it was planning  to close her account, and then continuing  to charge interest  
and overdraft charges.  She wants compensation for her distress and inconvenience and for 
interest and charges to be refunded. 
background
Miss L is a long standing  customer  of NatWest. 
In August  2018,  Miss L was told that NatWest intended to close  her account due to a 
breakdown in the relationship. No formal notice of account closure  was given, and nothing  
was confirmed in writing. 
Miss L was concerned  about this and so took steps  to move her income  to another  account. 
The last payment into her account was received in September 2018,  at which time her 
account was around  £2750  overdrawn.
NatWest continued  to apply charges and interest to Miss Ls account, taking the balance  to 
around £2900 by December 2018. 
Miss L complained to NatWest. 
NatWest sent its final response to Miss L in late October 2018. This set out that no notice of 
account closure had been  sent, and that it remained Miss Ls responsibility to ensure that the 
account was managed  in line with the terms. NatWest  therefore did not uphold  the 
complaint. Miss L was not happy  and contacted us. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into the complaint. NatWest  initially  refunded the charges 
that were applied between October  and December 2018 and placed the account on hold, but 
has subsequently continued to apply  interest  to the account. 
Our adjudicator has set out her view to the parties.  This was that NatWest had not given 
formal notice of account  closure  so we could  not consider if this was fair or not. The 
adjudicator thought that NatWest is entitled  to charge interest and charges on an 
outstanding overdraft, in line with its terms and conditions.  She therefore  did not consider 
that NatWest had done anything wrong,  and did not recommend NatWest do anything  
further. 
Miss L did not accept  that view and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I appreciate Miss Ls upset and worry when she learned that her account was likely  to 
be closed. She has explained  that she was worried that she would be left without  access to 
funds so took immediate steps  to move her income  to another  account. This is 
understandable.
Ref: DRN49739672Having done this, however, I cannot see that Miss L then made payments into her NatWest 
account, to ensure that the overdraft balance was being reduced, or discussed closing the 
account with NatWest. 
Miss L appreciates that she owes the balance  that was outstanding at the time she moved  
her income. This balance  includes  charges  and interest that were accrued while she was 
using the account. Miss L therefore  appears  to understand that charges were appropriate 
while she was actively using the account. 
I appreciate that she feels that any decision by NatWest to close her account would be unfair 
to her, but this does not mean that interest and charges (which applied  while  she was 
actively using the account)  would stop. She has continued to use the account  for the 
purposes of the overdraft  borrowing,  so charges would  continue to apply. 
NatWest did not give formal notice of Miss Ls account being closed, and gave no date for 
the account closure. As a result, Miss Ls account remained open  and live, and she 
remained responsible  for the account, and for keeping it in order. 
In order to close her account  and prevent  further charges, Miss L would need to repay the 
debt and close the account,  or reach an agreement with NatWest  so that the debt is being 
repaid. Without  such action, NatWest in entitled to apply charges  in line with the account 
terms, or to take other action to recover the debt owed. 
Miss L has also complained about the way NatWest dealt with her complaint and that her 
complaint was initially closed and had to be reopened.  Complaint  handling is not a regulated 
activity, however, so as a separate issue this is not something we can look at. 
I understand that Miss L will be disappointed by this decision, but for these reasons I do not 
uphold Miss Ls complaint  and do not ask NatWest to do anything  further. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I do not uphold Miss Ls complaint and do not ask National 
Westminster Bank Plc to do anything further.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2020.
