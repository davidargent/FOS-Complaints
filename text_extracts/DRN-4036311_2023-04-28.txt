Following Mr Ss complaint MoneyBoat wrote to him explaining why it wasnt going to uphold 
it. But it did, as a gesture of goodwill offer to pay him £249.90 which represented the interest, 
he paid on his final six loans. Mr S didnt accept this offer, and he instead referred the 
complaint to the Financial Ombudsman.
The complaint was initially reviewed by an adjudicator who didnt uphold it, instead, she 
recommended that Mr S accept the gesture of goodwill offer as outlined in the final response 
letter. 
Mr S accepted this assessment. But after the case was closed, MoneyBoat let us know that 
the offer  as made in the final response letter had been withdrawn and was no longer 
available. 
The complaint was then reopened, and considered by the adjudicator again, this time with 
some fresh information from Mr S about transactions in his bank statements that turned out 
to be gambling. 
The adjudicator then issued her second assessment, outlining why in her view MoneyBoat 
had, reasonably provided loans 1 to 4 and loans 7 to 9. She didnt uphold the complaint 
about these loans. 
In her view, when loans 5 and 6 and then when loans 10 to 12 were granted MoneyBoat 
ought to have carried out further checks into Mr Ss financial situation.  Had it done so, 
perhaps by reviewing his bank statements, it wouldve realised that Mr S was gambling to 
the extent that his priority bills werent being paid. This led the adjudicator to uphold the 
complaint about these loans. 
Mr S initially responded to say why he thought, loans 1 and 2 should also be upheld, given 
the gambling visible in his bank statements and the fact that he had borrowed money in 
order to repay outstanding payday loans. 
The adjudicator went back to Mr S to explain, that as it was early on in the lending 
relationship, she didnt think MoneyBoat needed to review his bank statements. Mr S then 
appeared to be happy to accept the outcome the adjudicator had reached in her view. 
MoneyBoat didnt respond to or acknowledge the adjudicators latest assessment. As no 
agreement has been received the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
MoneyBoat had to assess the lending to check if Mr S could afford to pay back the amounts 
hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate 
to the circumstances. MoneyBoats checks couldve taken into account a number of different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Ss income 
and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks 
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest MoneyBoat should have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr S. These factors include:
Mr S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr S. The adjudicator didnt think this 
applied to Mr S complaint. 
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay the loans  not 
just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough 
money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr S was able to repay 
his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
Mr S now appears to accept the outcome the adjudicator reached in her second assessment 
 which as Ive outlined above was a conclusion that loans 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 ought not to 
have been provided. The adjudicator didnt uphold the other loans Mr S was granted (1, 2, 3, 
4, 7, 8 and 9). Mr S has accepted this. 
Its worth pointing out here that MoneyBoat hasnt responded to the adjudicators second 
assessment, so I dont know what, if anything it thinks she may have missed or why it 
disagrees with the loans she has recommended should be upheld. 
As Mr S has accepted the outcome that was reached by the adjudicator, I dont intend to 
revisit the loans that the adjudicator didnt uphold as these are no longer in dispute. Instead, 
this decision will focus on whether MoneyBoat ought to have advanced loans 5, 6, 10, 11 
and 12. 
Loans 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12
Before I consider what happened when these loans were approved, like the adjudicator I do 
agree that Mr S took these loans in two chains. Loans 1  6 and then loans 7  12. I say this 
because there was around a seven-month period where Mr S didnt borrow. 
So, when he returned for loan 7, it was in my view, entirely reasonable of MoneyBoat to 
have treated his application afresh and if he was a new customer. This does have a bearing 
on the type and level of checks MoneyBoat ought to have carried out. And Ive kept that in 
mind when thinking about these loans. 
But, in saying that, having reviewed everything Ive been provided with, I am of the opinion 
that these loans ought not to have been advanced and Ive explained why below. 
For these loans, MoneyBoat carried out the same sort of checks. It started by asking Mr S to 
declare his income, and this ranged from £2,100 at loan 5 to £3,000 per month by the time 
loans 10 to 12 were granted. MoneyBoat says this figure was checked with a credit 
reference agency for its accuracy.
Mr S declared his expenditure to be around £425 at loan 5 to say up to around £795 per 
month by the time loan 12 was advanced. However, as part of the affordability check 
MoneyBoat said it did the following.
On your loan applications we increased the monthly expenditure that you input, on 
the basis that your credit report highlighted different expenditure than you had 
disclosed, and/or to bring you in line with the average expenditure listed on the 
Common Financial Statement.
As a result of these additional checks, MoneyBoat increased Mr Ss monthly expenditure by 
as much as £42 per month. After completing these checks, MoneyBoat wouldve been 
reasonably confident Mr S could afford his largest repayment due for this loans which was 
around £250 when loan 6 was approved. MoneyBoat says credit checks were carried out before these loans were granted, and a copy 
of the results have been provided to us. However, I dont feel that I need to review each 
credit report in detail, because even taking account of the checks that MoneyBoat did do, I 
still dont think, given what Ive seen that for these loans its checks were proportionate or 
went far enough and Ive explained why below. 
Thinking about the amounts Mr S was borrowing, his monthly commitments, how quickly 
some of these loans were being repaid and the relationship between when loans were 
repaid and when he returned for further borrowing. This ought to have led MoneyBoat to 
conclude that needed to gain a full understanding of Mr Ss financial situation in order to 
ensure these loans were affordable for him. 
MoneyBoat couldve carried out these additional checks, in a number of ways, it couldve 
asked for evidence of his outgoings such as copy bills. It couldve asked to see copies of 
Mr Ss bank statements or any other documentation it felt it needed to obtain in order to 
satisfy itself that it had carried out more robust checks. 
This wouldve helped verify information provided by Mr S and couldve revealed whether 
there was any other information MoneyBoat mightve needed to consider about Mr Ss 
financial position.
However, that isnt the end of the matter. For me to be able to uphold these loans, I have to 
be satisfied that had MoneyBoat carried out what I consider to be a proportionate check it 
wouldve likely discovered that Mr S couldnt afford the repayments or discovered it was 
likely unsustainable for him for some other reason.
Mr S has supplied copy bank statements from around the time these loans were approved. 
So, its entirely reasonable for me to consider what these statements show about his 
financial position. But as Ive said above, obtaining copy bank statements was just one of the 
ways MoneyBoat couldve gone about verifying his information. 
Having reviewed the bank statements, it shows a similar picture to that described in the 
adjudicators assessment. There are significant amount of cash withdrawals and payments 
made towards a betting shop. For example, in the days before loan 5 was advanced Mr S 
spent nearly £1,000 on these transaction  before any other living costs were considered. 
Due to these transactions several direct debits payments for things such as road tax were 
retuned unpaid. 
But a similar pattern is visible throughout the time I think MoneyBoat needed to do further 
checks  Mr S continued for example having returned direct debits. So, clearly, these loans 
werent sustainable or affordable for Mr S. 
In addition, throughout this time, Mr S had continued to take payday and high-cost credit 
loans from a number of different lenders. Which further supports that Mr S was having longer 
term financial difficulties. 
So had MoneyBoat carried out what I consider to be proportionate checks, it wouldve likely 
concluded that Mr S couldnt afford these loans. I am therefore upholding Mr Ss complaint 
about loans 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 and Ive outlined below what MoneyBoat needs to do in 
order to put things right for him. Putting things right
In deciding what redress MoneyBoat should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not lent loans 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 to Mr S, as Im satisfied it 
ought not to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to 
that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr S may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, he may have 
looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, he may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if he had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how he would (or ought 
to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is impossible to 
now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can 
fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would have been 
able to lend to Mr S in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce MoneyBoats liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
MoneyBoat shouldnt have given Mr S loans 5 and 6 and loans 10, 11 and 12. 
A. MoneyBoat should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything you have already refunded.
B. MoneyBoat should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr S which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. MoneyBoat should pay Mr S the total of A plus B. 
D. MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ss credit file in 
relation to loans 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to deduct tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
should give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mr Ss complaint in part.
Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk should put things right for 
Mr S as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2023.
