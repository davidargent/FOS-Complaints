K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt  with a dispute and a 
refunded payment.
background
Mr M says he sold an item online via a company I will call E for £110  plus postage costs. 
He says the buyer raised an issue with the item and asked for a refund which  he agreed to 
and asked that the item be returned to him. Mr M says he refunded the money but he didnt 
receive the item back and was told by the buyer that he had been told by E to dispose of it.  
Mr M says he spoke  to E and also spoke to PayPal. He says PayPal told him to cancel the 
refund by speaking  to his bank and using the Direct Debit  Indemnity Scheme. But he then 
found out PayPal took the £110  from him. Mr M says he wants  this money back and the 
buyer charged that amount.  He says PayPal hasnt  assisted him in this complaint, answered 
his questions or provided him with a copy of the call recording.
PayPal says it doesnt provide call recordings and doesnt accept making a mistake.  It says 
E agreed  to refund the seller and so it acted in line with the account terms and conditions  in 
those circumstances  by refunding the money. PayPal says Mr M chose to refund the seller 
himself and it was the seller that raised a dispute with E. It says it has no control  over those 
actions and it is a separate  company to E.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and says he should have been told by PayPal that it was 
going to take his money in any event  and he says it hasnt handled his complaint 
appropriately. Mr M accepts he made  a mistake by refunding the money  in the first place but 
says hes been  the victim of fraud.
Our investigator looked into what had happened and thought  PayPal had dealt fairly with the 
complaint. The investigator thought the messages  Mr M had provided showed that the buyer  
had raised a dispute with E and that we couldnt look at Es actions. And that PayPal had 
acted in line with its user agreement by refunding the money.  The investigator thought Mr M 
would have agreed to the terms of that agreement when  the PayPal account was opened 
and it didnt have  a choice but to process  the refund when E had made a decision on the 
dispute. The investigator thought Mr M should  direct  his complaint about the call recording to 
the Information Commissioners  Office (ICO).
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says the call provided legally binding evidence  telling  him 
what he should do. He says PayPal  has made  no attempt to answer  his questions and would 
like an ombudsman to review his complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator for the same reasons. I realise Mr M will be disappointed by 
my decision  and I appreciate how strongly  he feels about whats  happened. I also make  
clear that I understand his sense of injustice as he has not received the items  back  from the 
seller but has refunded  him.
Ref: DRN71834182Ive looked at the service agreement terms and conditions which  Im satisfied Mr M would 
have agreed to when the PayPal account  was opened. And Im satisfied that agreement 
makes clear  that if a dispute is raised  with E and that dispute is lost by the seller, then 
money is to be deducted by PayPal. I think that is what  happened  here and so I dont  think  
PayPal made a mistake  in those circumstances or acted  unfairly  by deducting  the money 
from Mr Ms account.  I also think that PayPal didnt  make  that decision to find in the sellers  
favour and as the investigator has explained we cant look at Es actions.
I can see that Mr M accepts he made  a mistake by refunding the money  in the first place but 
I dont think PayPal could  have done  any more  to assist him or had the ability  to cancel the 
payment. I also cant fairly hold PayPal responsible for what E may have told the seller about 
disposing of the item Mr M sold.
I appreciate Mr Ms frustration here and I appreciate what he says about  the call recording. 
But I think that part of his complaint will have to be directed to the ICO as the investigator 
has explained. I also think that the reason PayPal deducted the money was as a result of the 
outcome of the dispute with E. So I think it likely that during that call PayPal did advise Mr M 
on what he could do but the decision to refund was made later. And I wouldnt have 
reasonably have expected PayPal to know at that stage if there was a dispute  that E was 
dealing with.
I can also see that Mr M is unhappy  about  how PayPal has dealt with his complaint. But again, 
as the investigator  has explained, we are not the regulator of PayPal and so its not our role to 
tell a business what for example its complaint process is or how it handles  complaints.
Overall Im satisfied that PayPal has acted fairly here and in line with its agreement  with 
Mr M. I accept that Mr M is unlikely to accept my decision and can see that he is considering  
an alternative course of action against E, the seller  and PayPal. But I think this brings an end 
to what we in trying  to sort out this complaint informally can do.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 December 2019.
