The complaint
Mr G complains that Nationwide Building Society failed to clearly explain how interest is 
applied to his overdraft.
 
What happened
In April 2020 Mr G contacted Nationwide and asked it to explain the overdraft charges he 
had incurred. 
Mr G complained and Nationwide responded on 14 April 2020 and sent a follow up on 
22 April 2020. Nationwide gave information about the revised charging structure and said 
interest had been correctly applied to Mr Gs account. 
Mr G referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They didnt 
uphold Mr Gs complaint and said there was nothing to show Nationwide had made an error. 
Mr G asked to appeal and said no one had demonstrated how the interest applied to his 
account had been calculated. 
I obtained further information from Nationwide setting how the interest had been applied. I 
contacted Mr G, providing more information about the interest rate applicable for his 
overdraft and confirming I had completed my own calculations which replicated the figures 
given by Nationwide in its statements. As Mr G has asked to appeal the investigators view, I 
have been passed his complaint to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G complains that he was unable to reach the same results as Nationwide when looking at 
the interest he had been charged in March and April 2020. I contacted Nationwide for more 
information and have checked the amounts Mr G has been charged. I can confirm that the 
interest applied to Mr Gs account has been correctly calculated. 
The example interest rate on Mr Gs statements is 39.9%. But the actual interest rate 
Nationwide charge Mr G in March and April 2020 is set out on page 4 as 34.049%. I looked 
at the interest charged to Mr Gs account for February and March 2020 and completed my 
own calculations. I reached the same figures as Nationwide and didnt find any evidence of a 
mistake.
Mr G has asked for copies of the calculations used. Nationwides statements confirm it 
calculates interest on a daily basis and applies it to the account the following month. As an 
example, Ive used 1 February 2020. 
-£527x34.049%/365 = £0.49 
I applied the same calculation to the rest of February 2020 and found the following:
Dates Acc balance Number of days Interest charged
1/2-3/2 -£527  2  £0.98
3/2-10/2 -£2,425.36 7 £15.84
10/2-11/2 -£2,854.78 1 £2.66
11/2-14/2 -£2,874.78 3 £8.05
14/2-15/2 -£2,991.77 1 £2.79
15/2-25/2 -£2,996.76 10 £27.96
   £58.28
The total interest charged or February 2020 was £58.28. This figure matches what Mr G was 
charged by Nationwide. 
Whilst I understand Mr G wants Nationwide to provide the specific calculations, Im satisfied 
that is has explained how interest is applied within the statements. The statements Ive 
checked show Nationwide has calculated interest correctly. 
Mr G has also complained that a case handler told him they werent a financial advisor which 
he found rude. I agree it would have been better if the case handler had been able to give 
full details of how Nationwide calculates interest but Im not persuaded they sought to cause 
offence. 
Im satisfied Nationwide has applied interest to Mr Gs overdraft in line with the account 
terms and havent found any evidence of an error. Overall, Im satisfied Nationwide has dealt 
with Mr Gs complaint fairly so Im not telling it to take any further action.   
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2021.
