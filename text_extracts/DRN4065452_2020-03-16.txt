K821x#15complaint
Mr E has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  Elevate  
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr E says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr E took out some 20 instalment loans from Sunny between June 2016 
and June 2018. There was a notable  gap in the borrowing between loans 11-12 which Ill 
explain more about later. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Es borrowing, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
for loan numbers 6  11 and loan numbers 15 - 20. Sunny made an offer to settle the case  
which was rejected by Mr E so Im making a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Mr Es 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr E could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to have  taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN40654522whether Mr E could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr E could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. It follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and reasonably  
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if they are 
unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr E including assessing his income,  expenditure and creditworthiness. It said all this 
information showed that he would  be able to make the loan repayments  he was committing 
to although it subsequently offered to pay some money back. Ive thought about this and  
also looked at the overall  pattern of lending history with a view to seeing if there was a point 
at which  Sunny should reasonably have  seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some point, Sunny should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans  to Mr E. 
Ive also taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending  relationship,  
and applied  it to the circumstances of loans 1  4 in this case. And I dont think its clear  
enough that what Sunny would have would have  seen,  from its checks,  suggested loans 1  
4 were either  unaffordable  for Mr E. I think that by loan 5, it would  have been  useful for 
Sunny to have carried out more comprehensive checks  on Mr Es financial situation. But in 
this case, I dont think this would have  actually changed much   I think  Sunny would have 
still thought it was acceptable to lend and that Mr E could afford to pay this loan back.
I therefore dont  uphold the complaints about  loans 1  5.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending regarding  loans 6  11 in this case  
would have looked different and therefore  required a much more thorough and responsible  
approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr E should have caused it to see, in my 
view, that it shouldnt have provided  these loans. 
This is because loan 6 was Mr Es sixth short-term loan application  with Sunny in 13 months 
and was also taken  out whilst other  debt was still outstanding. Sunny ought to have realised 
that Mr E wasnt merely  borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he was 
borrowing regularly, to address shortfalls in his income and to meet  an ongoing need. Mr E 
was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term lending over a sustained period 
and the indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful,  in my view.  Sunny 
should have seen this and ought  to have realised  Mr E was at risk of not managing to repay 
the loans sustainably or getting into wider financial difficulties. Im therefore upholding this 
complaint in respect of loans 6 - 11. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr E in an unsustainable 
manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN40654523the length of time over which Mr E borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
Moving on, as I said, there then followed a fairly lengthy gap in the borrowing chain after 
loan number 11. 
With this in mind, I think its fair to re-set  the lending relationship somewhat and to consider 
once again, from the start,  that in the early  stages of this lending relationship, less thorough 
financial checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  In this respect I think the checks 
carried out for loans  12, 13 and 14 would have appeared affordable  from Sunnys 
perspective. Nevertheless,  it clearly had a lot of history with Mr E to judge whether the 
lending ought  to have continued  and it should have acted accordingly.
In my view, Sunny failed in this duty i.e. to properly assess Mr Es vulnerability. For loans 15 
and 16, for example, it can be seen that these loans were given to Mr E very quickly after the 
above previous  loans,  and indeed whist those loans  were still outstanding. Any reasonable 
assessment would have  shown  Mr E was struggling to manage his finances and lending  to 
him was certainly  not going  to improve this. It was therefore irresponsible  to lend him loan 
numbers 15 and 16 and Im upholding the complaints in respect  of them.
Once again however, for loans 17  20, I think an emerging pattern of repeated and harmful  
lending was evident. The pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr E should have caused it to see 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans because loan 17 was Mr Es sixth short-term 
loan application  (in this second lending chain)  and was also provided  whilst other debt was 
still outstanding.  
Sunny ought to have realised that Mr E wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term  
cash-flow problems; he was once again  borrowing very regularly, to address shortfalls in his 
income or meet an ongoing need. Loans  17 - 20 had the effect  of unfairly prolonging his 
indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use and the 
length of time over which Mr E borrowed was likely to have had further negative implications 
on his ability  to access mainstream credit, keeping him in the market  for high-cost loans. 
I therefore also uphold  the complaints about  loans  17  20
Ref: DRN40654524putting things right
Loans 6  11 and 15  20 were all lent irresponsibly, and I uphold the complaints in respect 
of them.  In order to put things right for Mr E, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 6  11 and 15 - 20;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Es credit file in relation to loan 15 
and 16. But the number of loans taken from loans 6 -11 and 14 - 20 mean any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans these should 
be completely removed from Mr Es credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr E a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Mr Es complaint and direct  Elevate  Credit  International Limited  to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 April 2020.
