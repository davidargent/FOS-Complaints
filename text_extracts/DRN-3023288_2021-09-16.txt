The complaint
Mrs N complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt refund her for a 
purchase. 
What happened
On 21 April 2020, Mrs N bought an item of equipment for her business. It cost £270 and she 
paid using PayPal. In July 2020, Mrs N advised the seller that the machine was faulty. On 31 
July 2020 Mrs N raised a dispute with PayPal under its Significantly Not As Described 
protection. On 19 August 2020, the dispute was escalated for review by PayPal. PayPal 
declined Mrs Ns claim.
Mrs N complained. She said she bought the item in April 2020 but didnt open it and try it out 
until July 2020  because her business was closed due to the lockdown until then. She then 
found it wasnt working properly and was leaking water. The seller asked her to try to repair it 
herself, but she didnt. She hadnt been able to resolve the problem with the seller and asked 
PayPal to investigate her claim. But PayPal had declined to pay her and found in favour of 
the seller. She said this wasnt fair.
PayPal said the problem with the machine was a warranty issue and fell outside their Buyer 
Protection cover. It wasnt covered under their Significantly Not As Described protection. 
Mrs N had received the correct item, it wasnt damaged in the post and it didnt differ from 
the sellers description. They questioned what had happened to the item between its 
purchase date and when it was first used  was it damaged while it was in Mrs Ns 
possession?
Mrs N brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said that PayPal hadnt acted fairly. He 
considered the item was covered by PayPals Buyer Protection. The time lag between 
purchase and use had been explained by Mrs N  and was plausible. And  she had brought 
her claim to PayPal within the necessary time limits. Mrs N had provided a video to our 
investigator of the leaking machine. He said that PayPal should refund the cost of the 
machine - £270, plus 8% per annum interest. And pay compensation of £50 and advise Mrs 
N on how to return the machine to the seller.
PayPal didnt agree. They said Mrs N had opened the case many weeks after the purchase. 
The item was received by her as described. There was no proof that the item had been 
used correctly, and they wondered how it had been stored and handled since the purchase. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals User agreement is clear on the rights of buyers. It says:  
PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a 
transaction:
You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received 
claim), or
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a 
Significantly Not as Described claim) .
Significantly Not as Described claims
An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:
The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.
You received a completely different item.
The condition of the item was misrepresented. For example, the item was 
described as new but the item was used.
The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e. counterfeit).
The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in   
the description of the item when you bought it.
You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.
The item was damaged during shipment.
The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.
There are also timescales set down for claims to be made  a dispute must be raised within 
180 days, and then a claim for reimbursement must be raised within another 20 days:
If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow 
our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under 
PayPal Buyer Protection. You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and 
speaking to an agent. The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not 
follow these steps your claim may be denied:
Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the payment. This might allow 
you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that 
may help resolve the dispute. If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, 
proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the 
dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement
So  I must decide if Mrs Ns claim met these terms. 
Mrs N provided evidence to us that the machine didnt work  it was leaking water. She 
showed us a video that this was the case. So, for me  its clear that the machine fell within 
PayPals User agreement of Significantly Not As Described  as The item is unusable in 
its received state and was not disclosed as such.
PayPal have said that the machine may have been damaged or misused between when 
it was paid for and received by Mrs N  in April 2020, and when she made her claim to 
PayPal  on 31 July 2020. But  Mrs N has reasonably argued her case - that her 
business was closed due to lockdown, and so the machine stayed in its box until she 
could open again in July 2020.And in any case, PayPals User Agreement allow for claims to be made within 180 days 
of payment. And Mrs Ns claim was sent to PayPal on 31 July 2020 after payment on 21 
April 2020  so this was well within the time limit. And  she escalated it as a claim for 
reimbursement on 19 August 2020  this was within the required further 20 days. Ive 
also seen that Mrs N tried to resolve the problem with the seller  as she had to - before 
approaching PayPal.
PayPal said that Mrs N had used it once and then noticed the fault  this meant that the 
machine worked at first, and therefore the problem was one that should be dealt with under 
the warranty. Ive considered this. What Mrs N said to PayPal was Due to Covid we only 
used first time end of June due to the training only available then and first time we used it it 
didnt work properly. For me, this meant the machine didnt work the first time, and it never 
worked properly. So  I dont agree with PayPal here.
So, in the circumstances of this case, I consider that PayPal havent acted fairly, and they 
should reimburse Mrs N with the cost of the machine (£270), as well as adding 8% per 
annum simple to this amount; and paying her compensation of £50. They should also 
provide Mrs N with the details of how to return the item to the seller. I believe this will mean 
that Mrs N will have to pay the return postage costs in line with PayPals User Agreement. 
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint and PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must:
Refund Mrs N the cost of the machine - £270. To this, they should add interest of 8% 
per annum simple from the date of payment to the date of refund.
Pay compensation of £50 for distress and inconvenience.
Provide Mrs N with the details of how to return the item to the seller. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
