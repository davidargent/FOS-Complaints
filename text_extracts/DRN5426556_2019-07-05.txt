K821x#15complaint
Mr N has complained about short term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as Quick  Quid (Quick  Quid  or the lender). 
background
Quick Quid agreed ten loans for Mr N between January 2012 and January 2016.  The 
amounts borrowed  ranged  between £400 and £1,500. Most were to be repaid in two 
amounts and Mr Ns seventh loan was an open-ended credit facility.  Some  of the information  
Quick Quid provided about  Mr Ns loans is shown in the table below.

*loan 7 was an open-ended  credit facility with a limit of £1,500 and a maximum repayment of £518 
under the example schedule in the original credit agreement. 
Mr N says that Quick Quid was irresponsible to lend to him. He says its loans were 
unaffordable and he had to borrow again to meet the shortfall in his income left by the 
repayments. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint in part and recommended that Quick Quid  refund 
the interest and charges he paid from loan 3 onwards. Mr N agreed with our 
recommendation. Quick  Quid didnt agree and so the complaint has come  to me, as an 
ombudsman, for review and final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
The Office  of Fair Trading  was the regulator  at the time when Mr N first borrowed from 
Quick Quid. The Financial Conduct Authority  took over from April 2014. The rules and 
guidance from both regulators were similar. Quick  Quid needed to check  that Mr N could 
afford to meet the repayments for his loans in a sustainable manner.  This means  being  able 
to meet  his repayments out of his normal income  without having to go without or borrow 
further. 
Ref: DRN54265562The regulations arent  prescriptive  about what checks Quick Quid needed to carry out. But 
the checks needed to be proportionate to the circumstances. In general,  Id expect a lender 
to require more  assurance the greater the potential risk to the consumer  of not being able to 
repay the credit in a sustainable  way. 
So, for example,  Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying  out more detailed 
checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
So, as our adjudicator  did, Ive first thought about  whether  or not the checks Quick Quid  
carried out were proportionate and, if not, what proportionate checks might have shown. 
Ive also thought about whether or not the number of high cost short term loans  
Quick Quid provided to Mr N in itself was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful. The purpose 
of short  term credit is to provide a solution  to a short term cash flow problem and using this 
type of credit  to meet ongoing financial need  is likely to be unsustainable.  
 
Applying all of this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, and for the same reasons.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 3 and 4 would have shown that 
Mr N wasnt likely to be able to meet his repayments  for these loans. This was because  the 
highest repayments for these came to about  45% of Mr Ns stated monthly income of 
£4,000. I agree with this view. Ive also considered  that these loans were to be repaid in two 
amounts, but I dont  think it was reasonable of Quick Quid  to think  Mr N could spread his 
repayments over the loan term. Hed borrowed  loan 3 within a few days  of repaying loan 2. 
And loan 4 within a few weeks of loan 3. This suggests to me that Mr N could only manage 
the shortfall in his income left by meeting his previous repayments with further borrowing, as 
he explained  in his complaint to this Service. So, altogether, I think  Quick Quid was 
irresponsible to have  agreed to these  two loans.
Mr N asked for a fifth loan in November 2012. He had first come to Quick Quid to borrow 
£400 at the start of the year and this was now his fourth request to borrow  an amount of 
£1,500. It should have  been obvious  to Quick Quid by now that Mr N wasnt borrowing to 
manage a short term gap in his finances but to meet an ongoing need. And so he wasnt 
likely to be meeting his repayments in a sustainable  way. Continuing  to provide short  term 
loans to Mr N under these  circumstances  was irresponsible. And so Quick Quid was wrong 
to agree to loan 5 and to subsequent loans.
Altogether, Mr N was indebted  to Quick  Quid for over four years.  This meant he paid high 
interest rates to essentially service a debt of a similar level to the lender over this time 
without making any real inroads into the amount he owed. Furthermore, the number of loans 
and the length of time he was taking  out short term credit were likely to have been viewed 
negatively by other lenders and may have restricted Mr Ns ability  to take out credit 
elsewhere. 
I have considered that there was a gap of about seven months between Mr N repaying 
loan 7 and taking out loan 8. But when Mr N came to apply for loan 8 hed been indebted to 
Quick Quid almost continuously for about  two and a half years before pausing. Hed taken 
Ref: DRN54265563out six loans and drawn down on his credit facility  13 times, the last five of which were for 
£1,500 which he repaid  in full then drew  down again within  weeks.  So when he came to ask 
for yet another amount of £1,500 in January 2015 I dont think it was reasonable of 
Quick Quid to think Mr Ns ongoing need  for this level of credit had been resolved and this 
was somehow a new situation.
In summary,  Im upholding  Mr Ns complaint about  loans 3 to 10 and Quick  Quid  needs to 
put things right for him.
what Quick Quid needs to do to put things right
refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 3 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  about  loans 3 and 4 from Mr Ns credit file;
the period  of time over which Mr N owed Quick Quid money  means that any 
information recorded about loans  5 to 10 is adverse. So all entries  about  these loans  
should be removed  from his credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest.  Quick Quid  must give 
Mr N a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im partially  upholding  Mr Ns complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid)  should put things right for him as Ive outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
