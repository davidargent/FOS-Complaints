The complaint
Mr M complains that Metro Bank PLC trading as RateSetter (RateSetter) unfairly arranged a 
loan which was unaffordable for him.
What happened
In August 2019, Mr M entered into a peer-to-peer loan agreement arranged by RateSetter. 
The loan was for £7,000 with an APR of 19.9%. The monthly repayments were £178.96 and 
were due to be paid over a period of 60 months. 
In November 2020, Mr M wrote to RateSetter and said he thought the loan had been 
irresponsibly arranged as it was clearly unaffordable for him. Mr M says that RateSetter 
shouldve checked his credit report properly. Had it done so, it wouldve seen he had a 
number of credit accounts open with considerable credit in use. 
RateSetter reviewed Mr Ms complaint. It explained that it considered several factors such as 
reviewing credit profiles, credit history and affordability as well as information given in the 
application itself. Based on the information it gathered, it didnt think it had arranged the loan 
irresponsibly. 
Mr M remained unhappy with RateSetters response, so he brought his complaint to this 
service. The complaint was ultimately reviewed by an investigator who thought RateSetter 
had carried out proportionate checks before arranging the loan and the decision it made to 
arrange the loan was fair.
RateSetter didnt disagree with the investigators findings, but Mr M did and mostly repeated 
his earlier points. As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me to 
review afresh and make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The rules and regulations in place at the time Mr M was provided with the loan, required 
RateSetter to carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of whether Mr M could 
afford to repay what he owed in a sustainable manner. This is sometimes referred to as an 
affordability assessment or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused. This means RateSetter had to think about whether 
repaying the credit sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse consequences for Mr M. 
In other words, it wasnt enough for RateSetter to consider the likelihood of it getting the 
funds back  it had to consider the impact of any repayments on Mr M. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the lending. In 
general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent on a number 
of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the consumer (e.g. 
their financial history, current situation and outlook, any indications of vulnerability or 
financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they were seeking. Ive kept all of this 
in mind when thinking about whether RateSetter did what it needed to before arranging a 
loan for Mr M. 
As I understand it, this was Mr Ms first loan with RateSetter. From the information Ive been 
provided with, RateSetter asked Mr M for information about his personal situation, the 
purpose of the loan and his income. Mr M told RateSetter that the loan was for a car, and his 
income was around £1,408 a month. RateSetter said it then checked Mr Ms income using a 
third party. And, the results suggested Mr Ms income was very likely to be at least what was 
stated on the application. RateSetter also asked Mr M some questions about his living 
expenses such as his rent, which, as I understand it, RateSetter rounded up when 
calculating the affordability of the loan.
RateSetter also asked Mr M about his existing credit commitments. There were no other 
recorded credit commitments on the application form. Its unclear whether this is because 
Mr M stated that he had no other credit commitments, or whether these questions werent 
answered. However, RateSetter didnt rely on this information from the application and 
instead reviewed Mr Ms credit file to check this for itself.
RateSetters credit check showed that Mr M had 8 active accounts  six credit cards, an 
overdraft and a loan. The checks also showed that Mr M was utilising around 42% of the 
balances available on his existing revolving credit facilities  he had around £3,362 
outstanding against available limits of £8,050. The checks also showed Mr M was committed 
to paying around £67 a month towards an unsecured loan. I understand Mr M has said his 
credit utilisation was higher at the time. However, I dont think it was unreasonable for 
RateSetter to rely on the information it had obtained itself from the Credit Reference 
Agencies, which was based on what his other lenders were reporting at the time.
RateSetters credit check also indicated that all accounts were being managed well, with no 
recent repayment issues on any of Mr Ms active accounts, such as any public records, 
defaults or any missed payments. So, Im persuaded there were no obvious signs of 
financial difficulty from the credit check RateSetter did. 
Taking all this into consideration, Im persuaded that the checks RateSetter carried out were 
proportionate and I dont think it was unreasonable for it to rely on the information it had 
found out, which suggested that Mr M would likely be able to sustainably afford the loan 
repayments.
I appreciate Mr M told us he had trouble repaying the loan and had to take out further 
borrowing around a year later to pay off this loan. So, its possible that his circumstances 
may have worsened after the loan was approved. But, as mentioned above, Im satisfied that 
the checks RateSetter carried out were proportionate in the circumstances. And Im not 
persuaded that the information received from the checks suggested Mr M wouldnt have 
been able to afford the loan.
So, whilst Im sorry to hear of the financial difficulties Mr M went on to have, Im afraid I wont 
be upholding this complaint. Im persuaded that the checks RateSetter carried out in the 
circumstances of this particular case were proportionate and the result of the checks 
suggested that Mr M would be able to afford the credit it was arranging for him. It follows that 
I dont think RateSetter treated Mr M unfairly in arranging this loan.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive outlined above, I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2022.
