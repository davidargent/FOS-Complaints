The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as O, complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited has unfairly 
charged it £10,958 of authorisation fees. O is represented in bringing this complaint by one 
of its directors, who Ill refer to as Mr F. 
What happened
O accepts card payments on its website, using WorldPay as its merchant acquirer and a 
third party as its payment services provider (PSP). 
In March 2021, O received an invoice from WorldPay, which contained an unexpected 
£10,958 of miscellaneous charges.  
O complained to WorldPay, which said that the charges were authorisation fees relating to 
over 200,000 small card transaction attempts, which took place over a matter of hours. 
WorldPay said that this was likely to stem from an activity known as high volume card-
testing. 
WorldPay declined to refund the charges, saying the card-testing had been enabled by a 
vulnerability within the [PSP] gateway. WorldPay suggested that O speak to its PSP about 
what could be done to prevent further card-testing attempts. 
O referred its complaint to our service. It questioned why WorldPay didnt flag the 
transactions and thought it was morally incorrect for WorldPay to profit from them. 
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. She considered the terms of Os 
agreement with WorldPay and concluded that it wouldnt be fair to ask WorldPay to refund 
the fees. 
O disagreed with our investigator and asked for an ombudsman to look at things again. Mr F 
took the view that, as the transactions were declined, no money changed hands so they 
shouldnt be chargeable. He also queried at what point WorldPay would have flagged the 
fraud and why it was fair for WorldPay to profit from it.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think both sides agree that its likely O has been the victim of a technique known as high 
volume card-testing. This is where fraudsters attempt a large number of low value payments 
with an online merchant to check if stolen card details are still valid or to search for valid card 
numbers. Automated bots or scripts are often used to carry out a large amount of card-
testing transactions in a very short period of time. 
The decision for me is whether its fair and reasonable for WorldPay to charge O 
authorisation fees in these circumstances. 
First, I think its worth me setting out that Im not aware of any regulations that specifically 
require merchant acquirers to do anything to protect their customers from card-testing. Im 
also not aware of any regulations that prevent the acquirer from charging for them.
My starting point is therefore to look at the terms of the contract between WorldPay and O. 
But Ive also considered how transactions are processed and whether its reasonable to rely 
on the contract in the specific circumstances of this case. 
The contract between WorldPay and O comprises several documents, including the 
Merchant Services Agreement (MSA), Pricing Schedule and the Customer Operating 
Instructions. These documents collectively set out the responsibilities and liabilities of the 
parties. The first thing I have considered is whether WorldPay has complied with the terms of 
this agreement. 
I havent seen evidence of the original imposition of the authorisation fee, but I dont think O 
disputes that it knew about this. I have seen evidence that WorldPay wrote to O informing it 
that they were increasing the authorisation fee to 4.5p per transaction in December 2017. 
And Ive seen that WorldPay said they were doing this in line with increased costs from 
Visa. 
WorldPay gave O two months notice of the increase in fees and gave O the option to 
terminate the contract immediately for no additional charge, if it wasnt prepared to accept 
the changes. Im satisfied that this increase was permitted by the MSA and made in 
accordance with its requirements. 
Having examined the documentation, my conclusion is that the contract permits WorldPay to 
charge a fee for each authorisation attempt. There is no exception for card testing. And O 
was given due notice of the increase in the fee and didnt object. 
The MSA also says that the merchant (in this case O) is solely responsible for establishing 
and applying adequate security systems and procedures. And the merchant is responsible 
for all losses resulting from any unauthorised activity. I think this made it clear that 
WorldPay wouldnt accept responsibility for attacks on the security of Os payment 
arrangements. 
I have considered whether WorldPay should nonetheless have taken further steps to prevent 
this type of activity from happening. My conclusion is that I dont think it would be fair to 
expect this. Ill explain why next. 
O uses a third-party PSP to submit all payment requests to the relevant card company, 
which then authorises or declines them. WorldPays role only becomes active when the PSP 
passes on the transaction information to WorldPay via a nightly bulk transmission. Its at that 
point that WorldPay then processes the transactions, requesting funds from the cardholders 
for authorised transactions and then crediting Os merchant account. 
I think its clear from the above that WorldPay receives the transaction details in arrears. It is 
hence too late at that stage for it to take any action to stop card-testing occurring in real time. 
I therefore have some sympathy with the argument that WorldPays role occurs at the end of 
the process and they are therefore not best placed to implement any safeguards.
I also note that WorldPays Customer Operating Instructions cover card-testing specifically 
and offer some guidance on potential safety measures for merchants and their PSPs to 
consider. 
Its possible that there may be additional controls WorldPay could hypothetically put in place to try to identify card-testing activity through its acquiring account, since this is used to 
transmit the authorisation requests. But any such checks would inevitably slow down 
processing and introduce additional steps in the merchant acquiring process, thereby 
incurring further costs. I am satisfied that WorldPay arent obliged to take on this 
responsibility. Neither do I think it is unfair of them not to do so, given that the contract 
makes it clear that they arent responsible. 
I think its also worth mentioning that WorldPay are not the only merchant acquirer to include 
authorisation fees in their contract. Nor are they the only merchant acquirer to charge these 
fees for declined transactions, including those that look likely to result from to card-testing. 
So I dont think WorldPays actions in this case are out of line with typical industry practice. 
I do sympathise with O, which has been the victim of an unexpected attack on its website. 
Although the card-testing attempts were all unsuccessful, O has still ended up with a 
material loss, due to WorldPays authorisation fees. 
I understand Os argument that WorldPay shouldnt profit from this activity. But the card 
companies charge WorldPay a fee for each authorisation request, whether it is authorised or 
declined, card-testing or otherwise. In any case, it isnt my role to tell WorldPay how to 
conduct their business or what charges to apply, but rather to decide whether they have 
acted fairly in the circumstances of this particular case. Ultimately, merchant services are 
provided on the open market and O can exit its contract if it wishes.
In summary, Ive found that WorldPay is entitled to charge an authorisation fee for every 
transaction attempt under the terms of the agreement O signed. WorldPay, in their role as 
merchant acquirer, were responsible for processing transactions and didnt have control over 
Os website or the PSP. In the absence of any error on the part of WorldPay, I dont consider 
I can reasonably require it to refund the fees. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2022.
