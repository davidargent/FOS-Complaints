The complaint
J, a limited company, complains that ClearBank Limited (trading as Tide) hasnt protected it 
against fraud as it has allowed a scammer to open and operate an account into which its 
director was tricked into transferring funds for what he believed was a legitimate purchase.
Mr R is representing J in his capacity as director of J. Mr R in turn is represented by a third 
party. It was Mr R that fell victim to the scam, so I have mainly referred to him throughout 
this decision.
I understand the recipient account is operated through a platform provided by ClearBanks 
business partner under the Tide brand. But for ease of reading, Ill refer to ClearBank 
throughout, but where relevant the reference should be understood as meaning Tide.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here. On 9 October 2022 Mr R was sadly the 
victim of a scam. A scammer tricked him into sending a payment for Â£1,440 from Js account 
to another account held with ClearBank. At the time Mr R believed he was making a 
payment to a wholesaler.
Once he realised hed been a victim of a scam, Mr R reported this to ClearBank on 18 
October 2022. 
One of our Investigators considered the complaint but didnt recommend it should be upheld. 
In summary he didnt think there were failures by ClearBank as the receiving bank in relation 
to the loss. 
Mr Rs representative disagreed and asked for an Ombudsman to review Mr Rs complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear Mr R was the victim of a scam in this way. And I can quite understand why 
he wants to do all he can to try to recover his funds. But contrary to what Mr Rs 
representative has told us, there is no automatic refund for victims of fraud. It would only be 
fair for me to direct ClearBank to make a payment where they are responsible for errors that 
otherwise would have prevented the loss or a part of it. 
This case solely relates to ClearBank in its capacity as the receiving bank.
Im satisfied that ClearBank correctly followed their account opening process for the account 
that received money from Mr R. Ive seen evidence of the electronic checks ClearBank 
conducted throughout the account opening process. And Ive also seen the evidence they 
took from their customer for proof of identity. And overall, I dont think ClearBank failed when 
opening the account. There was nothing at that stage that indicated that the account might 
later go on to be used in connection with a fraud or a scam. So, I dont think ClearBank could 
have prevented Mr Rs loss in relation to the opening of the account.
The account had been opened two days before Mr Rs funds entered the account and this 
was the first activity. Im satisfied none of the account activity ought to have caused concern 
 the payment itself was unremarkable. I appreciate it is a lot of money to Mr R but I dont 
think it would have stood out to ClearBank as so unusual or suspicious such that they ought 
to have done more. So, in relation to Js outstanding loss, I dont think there have been any 
failings by ClearBank regarding the monitoring of the recipient account, so I cant say they 
missed an opportunity to prevent Js loss in this way.
Im also satisfied that ClearBank took appropriate action in relation to the (second 
generational) recipient account upon being notified that Js payment was as the result of a 
scam. And Ive seen the evidence from the second generational receiving bank telling 
ClearBank the funds from the payment that represents Js loss were spent moments after 
they were received and before ClearBank knew or reasonably could have known they were 
the proceeds of a scam. This is not unusual as scammers usually spend the money within 
hours. So, I dont think ClearBank did anything which negatively impacted the chances of a 
successful recovery. 
I appreciate Mr Rs representative has also asked ClearBank to share further details of the 
exact checks and other material information weve relied on. Unfortunately, data protection 
laws prevent both ClearBank and our service sharing this information with Mr R. 
Im sorry to hear Mr R lost money to a scammer. But as I dont think ClearBank are 
responsible for anything that caused the loss or hindered its recovery, there isnt a 
reasonable basis upon which I can direct them to do more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask J to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2023.
