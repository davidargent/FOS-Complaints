K820x#14complaint
Mr I says that after receiving a £400 deposit into his account his balance hasnt been 
accurate. This has led to him being overdrawn and hed like Santander UK Plc to credit him 
the difference. 
background
Mr I has two bank accounts   a basic and a top up account - with Santander. In August 2018 
he received a credit of £400 from a third party into one of his Santander bank accounts. Mr I 
tried to withdraw some of this money but had problems with the ATM dispensing  and 
complained to Santander. Mr I accepted that hed been refunded  by Santander for the failed  
withdrawals, but didnt think his account  balances were now correct. In particular he thought 
he shouldnt be overdrawn in his top up account.   
Santander said:
-they checked the balance of both Mr Is accounts and his top up account was 
overdrawn by £196.13 due to the re-debit of funds after an ATM dispute
-they said that since the 11 September  2018  Mr Is balance  has been overdrawn
-on the 18 Jan 2019 Mr I received a refund for an ATM dispute and the funds were 
deposited into his basic rather than top up account 
Our investigator looked at Mr Is complaint and didnt  think  that Santander needed  to do 
anymore. He explained that he was satisfied Mr Is balances  matched the money he had 
coming into his account  including  the £400  deposit. 
Our investigator also thought that the reason his top up account was overdrawn was 
because Mr I had asked  for the ATM refund to be paid into the basic  account. 
Mr I didnt accept our investigators opinion. He said if Santander had refunded his money  
as theyd agreed to do  then he wouldnt be overdrawn in his top up account. 
As Mr I didnt  agree with our investigators  outcome  its been passed to me for a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And in doing so Ive come to the same  
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons. 
Ive looked at Mr Is account statements and Im satisfied  that hes been refunded for the 
disputed withdrawals and had access to the £400. I say this because:
-I can see that on the 18 August 2018, Mr I received a credit of £400 into his top up 
account 
-on the 19 August  2018 Mr I was given a refund of £240 for a disputed ATM 
withdrawal
-on the 21 August  2018 Mr I was given a temporary refund of £230  for a disputed  
ATM withdrawal   after Santander  investigated they re-debited the amount on the 
11 September 2018 putting Mr I into his overdraft on his top up account
Ref: DRN41264792-on the 18 January  2019 Mr I was given an ATM refund  of £200 and £50 
compensation which was paid into his basic account
Ive thought about why I think Mr I believes  his top up account  balance isnt correct.  And I 
think its because the disputed withdrawal of £200   refunded to him on the 18 January 2019 
 was debited  from his top up account but refunded to his basic account. And as Mr I agreed 
to this, I cant see that Santander did anything  wrong in making the refund this way. 
I realise this will be disappointing  to Mr I but for the reasons  Ive explained above I dont 
think Santander need to do anymore here. 
my final decision
I dont uphold Mr Is complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 October  2019.
