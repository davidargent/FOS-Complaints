The complaint
Mr A says Western Circle Ltd trading as Cashfloat, irresponsibly lent to him. He says that if it 
had looked properly into his circumstances it wouldve seen that he had adverse credit file 
makers and not lent to him. 
What happened
This complaint is about five payday loans Cashfloat provided to Mr A between March and 
July 2019.

I can see that Mr A used a bank chargeback facility to recall some of the repayments he 
made towards loans 2 to 5 after he had repaid them. He did this in around September 2019. 
Some of the loans are not fully repaid now because of this. But this doesnt affect my 
consideration of Mr As irresponsible lending complaint as it happened after the time of sale. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. He said that it was reasonable for the business 
to rely on the information it gathered for the earlier loans. It shouldve made better checks for 
the later loans, but the information Mr A provided didnt show that it was irresponsible to 
approve these loans. 
Mr A disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. He said he had some other high cost credit 
and some car finance. This meant is was irresponsible to lend to him. As no agreement has 
been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Cashfloat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt 
lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to 
make sure Mr A could repay their loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that 
the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
loans 1 - 3
For loan 1 Mr A needed to repay around £400 the month after taking the loan. Mr A 
borrowed a greater amount for loan 2 and he was scheduled to repay around £375 over the 
next two months. He needed to make four repayments of around £275 for loan 3. 
Ive seen a record of the information Mr A provided when he completed his loan applications 
for these first three loans. Mr A said he had a monthly income of at least £3,400 for the first 
loan and around £4,000 for loans 2 and 3. He had regular monthly outgoings that averaged 
around £1,500. So, it would have been reasonable for Cashfloat to think that Mr A could 
afford the loan repayments based on the information he provided. 
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Cashfloat was made aware of any 
financial problems Mr A mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to 
investigate his circumstances further. So, I think it was reasonable for Cashfloat to rely on 
the information it obtained for these first three loans.
loans 4 - 5
As the adjudicator said, I can accept that going forward, for loans 4 and 5, it wouldve 
seemed likely that Mr A was having some longer term financial problems. And he was 
borrowing similar amounts to before but making the repayments over a longer timeframe. 
And so Cashfloat shouldve looked further into his circumstances. 
Mr A has said that if Cashfloat had done this it wouldnt have lent to him due to the amount 
of other debt he had. But Ive looked at the information on the credit report he has supplied 
to us. I can see, as he says, that he had some longer-term finance arrangements. He had 
also used short term and high cost credit in the past. But he had very little shorter-term credit 
outstanding when he took these loans from Cashfloat. So, I think that even if Cashfloat had 
looked further into his circumstances before approving loans 4 and 5 it would still have lent 
to him. 
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments Cashfloat did for loans 1 to 5 
were proportionate. So, I think Cashfloats decisions to lend for these loans were reasonable 
and Im not upholding Mr As complaint about them. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2021.
