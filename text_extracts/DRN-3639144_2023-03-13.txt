The complaint
Miss D complains that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to her the money that she 
paid for some holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by 
a claims management company.
What happened
Miss D and her then husband entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday 
club in September 2009. The purchase price of the trial membership was £3,995 which 
Miss D paid for using a loan from First Holiday Finance. They traded-in their trial 
membership for some holiday club membership points in April 2010. The price of the 
membership points was £16,887, the trial membership was given a trade-in value of £3,995 
and they made an advance payment of £500 so the amount due from them was £12,392. 
Miss D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of that 
amount and agreed to make 144 monthly repayments of £176.58 to First Holiday Finance. 
First Holiday Finance says that the September 2009 loan was consolidated and the account 
for that loan was closed. 
Miss D and her husband have separated and her husbands interest in the membership 
points was transferred to Miss D in March 2012. Miss Ds representative made claims to 
First Holiday Finance in May 2017 that a commission was paid by First Holiday Finance to 
the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Miss D and her husband and that their 
relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair.
First Holiday Finance didnt uphold her claim and the holiday company said that it didnt 
accept that there was an unfair relationship. Miss D wasnt satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service. 
Her complaint was considered by an investigator who said that he believed that, had First 
Holiday Finance carried out proportionate checks and collected sufficient information, it 
wouldnt have made the decision to lend to Miss D so he recommended that her complaint 
should be upheld. The remedy that he proposed wasnt accepted by Miss D and her 
complaint was then considered by another investigator. He didnt recommend that Miss Ds 
complaint should be upheld. He said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that 
the lending was unaffordable for Miss D and he didnt consider that First Holiday Finance 
had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company.
Miss Ds representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has described the serious concerns that it has about the way in which the 
finance was sold to Miss D and it has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company. Miss D has responded in detail and has provided some payslips. She says 
that at the time of the loan she had credit card debts and her wages werent enough to cover 
her monthly outgoings. She says that the income on the application form was pro-rated as 
she was only working part-time, which was known by the holiday company, and it didnt 
make a credit check. She says that First Holiday Finance lent to her irresponsibly and that it 
didnt carry out standard affordability procedures. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Miss Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Miss Ds claim to First Holiday Finance was that it had paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Miss D and her husband and that their 
relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair;
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a court the power, amongst 
other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Miss Ds claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not First Holiday Finances 
response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
First Holiday Finance says that all relevant affordability checks were carried out and 
no commissions were paid or received  and Ive seen no evidence to show that First 
Holiday Finance any commission to the holiday company relating to the loan that was 
made to Miss D;
I understand that a loan was made to Miss D in September 2009 to pay for the 
purchase of a trial membership but that loan was consolidated and has been closed;
Miss D and her then husband entered into an acquisition agreement in April 2010 to 
buy some holiday club membership points and the balance due from them was 
£12,392  Miss D entered into a loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan 
of that amount and agreed to make 144 monthly payments of £176.58 to First 
Holiday Finance;
Miss D signed a loan application form in April 2010 in which she said that she was an 
employed home-owner with an annual income of £40,000 and I consider that it would 
have been reasonable for First Holiday Finance to conclude on the basis of that 
information that a loan with monthly repayments of £176.58 was affordable for her;
Miss D says at that time she had credit card debts, her wages werent enough to 
cover her monthly outgoings and her income was pro-rated as she was only working 
part-time  but shed signed the application form which declared that her gross 
earnings including overtime and bonus were £40,000 and there was no reference on 
the form to her working part-time, her income being pro-rated or less than £40,000;
Miss D also signed a loan application form in December 2010 in which she again 
declared an income of £40,000 and said that her then husbands income was 
£30,000 so they had a joint income of £70,000;
Miss D wrote to the holiday company in March 2012 about transferring her points to 
her sole name and she paid the admin charge but there was no reference in that 
letter to any issues with the affordability of the loan;
Miss Ds representative made claims to First Holiday Finance in June 2017 about the 
loan but there was no reference in that letter to the loan being unaffordable for 
Miss D or to any compliant about irresponsible lending or the affordability 
assessment that was conducted; Miss Ds complaint was made to this service in December 2017 and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that shed made a complaint about the affordability of the loan until 
after that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan that was made 
to Miss D in April 2010 wasnt affordable for her at that time;
Miss D has described the financial difficulties that shes experiencing and, if she 
hasnt already done so, I suggest that she contacts First Holiday Finance and 
explains her financial difficulties to it  its required to respond to any financial 
difficulties that shes experiencing positively and sympathetically;
Miss Ds representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Miss Ds relationship with 
First Holiday Finance was unfair;
Miss Ds representative has described its serious concerns about the way in which 
the finance was sold to Miss D  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the loan was mis-sold to Miss D or that First Holiday Finance has acted 
incorrectly in its dealings with Miss D;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Miss Ds relationship 
with First Holiday Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Miss D and First 
Holiday Finance in these circumstances;
First Holiday Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Miss Ds claims so I 
cant say that its response to her claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to her claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Miss D for her financial difficulties and the issues that shes 
suffered, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require First Holiday Finance to refund to her any of the money that shes paid 
under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ds complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 April 2023.
