K820x#14complaint
Mr S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd has started charging interest on his store  card account  
after it agreed to freeze it indefinitely until his debt was paid off. 
background
Mr S says NewDay  agreed to block his account  and indefinitely freeze  interest payable  on it. 
But despite  him making the minimum monthly payments as agreed,  its started charging 
interest again. He says hes been  bullied, humiliated and emotionally hurt by the way hes 
been treated and has suffered distress. He wants NewDay to abide by the agreement,  stop 
charging interest and to apologise. 
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld  as NewDay  has treated Mr S fairly. 
She said:
Mr S accepted a credit card and agreed  to its terms and conditions. These included 
NewDay charging interest on what was borrowed. 
When Mr S contacted it to say he was experiencing  financial difficulties  NewDay  
agreed to freeze the interest  on the account. Mr S says he thought this would be 
permanent so long as he paid the minimum payments and he denies he was told this 
was temporary. But NewDay has provided a letter it sent dated 5 February 2016 in 
which it confirmed the freeze would be in place for three  months. It also confirmed  
the account shouldve been  reviewed six months later. As this didnt happen the 
interest on Mr S account has actually  remained frozen for two years which benefits 
him.
In 2018 NewDay  reviewed matters and as Mr S financial difficulties were  continuing 
and he said nothing  had changed, NewDay asked  him to complete an income  and 
expenditure form. And it said if this showed continuing financial difficulties Mr S could 
enter into a payment  arrangement This offer still stands and NewDay  has explained 
this would be recorded on Mr S credit  file and may affect his credit  score.  Mr S isnt 
happy with his credit score being affected and says he prefers  to continue making the 
minimum payments.  
NewDay also apologised for some incorrect information given to Mr S at the time of 
the February 2016 letter.  
Mr S also says he was obliged to disclose some  very personal and distressing 
information to NewDay on the phone. But at the time it was asking him about  
completing an income and expenditure form which wasnt unreasonable.  Mr S chose 
to disclose the personal family  information  when NewDay was asking  about  his 
financial situation and standing. NewDay hasnt done anything wrong.
Mr S doesnt  agree  and has asked for an ombudsman  review. In summary he says NewDay  
never said the interest freeze was temporary.  It said it would freeze the interest so long as 
he made the minimum payments which hes done.  Cancelling the agreement  adjusted the 
terms and conditions rendering them  null and void. It only charged interest again as he 
wouldnt tell it personal information about his family. He never received the 5 February 2016 
letter. NewDay shouldve notified him of any change  in the terms and conditions  in advance. 
Hes now borrowed  money elsewhere  to pay off the debt.
Ref: DRN67543472my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S told NewDay in 2016 that he was experiencing financial difficulties and it says he asked 
for a three month arrangement freezing interest  and ensuring he didnt receive any additional 
charges. NewDay agreed and confirmed this in a letter of 5 February 2016. 
Mr S says he didnt receive  this letter. Thats  unfortunate but I cant  hold NewDay  
responsible for that. The letter says the interest  freeze was available  for three months  and 
he should contact  NewDay if he wanted an extension. It also said that as Mr S was 
maintaining his normal monthly payments  his credit rating wouldnt be adversely affected.  
NewDay also apologised for some incorrect information Mr S had been given and said it was 
crediting Â£20 to his account for that.
Because NewDay didnt review  Mr S account  when  it says it shouldve done this interest  
freeze actually continued  to his benefit  for a two year period.
NewDay eventually reviewed the account in 2018  and when Mr S said he was still in 
financial difficulty NewDay asked for income and expenditure information. And it said if his 
problems were continuing he could enter into a payment arrangement.  But as Mr S didnt 
want that to affect  his credit score he declined this offer and decided  to continue making his 
minimum payments.
NewDay has an obligation to treat Mr S with forbearance, positively and sympathetically 
when he has been experiencing financial difficulties. And I think  it has done so throughout in 
this case.
Contrary to what Mr S has suggested  I think NewDay made  clear  the interest freeze was 
temporary and, when it reviewed matters,  it reasonably asked him for information about his 
financial situation. I also dont think NewDay  bullied  him into revealing distressing personal 
family information as Mr S suggests. It appears in the relevant conversation on the phone  
NewDay was reasonably asking about  Mr S financial and other relevant circumstances 
when he became upset and chose  to speak about  other obviously distressing family  matters.
Mr S has also recently suggested  he shouldve been  given  advance  notice about the change 
to his terms and conditions or that they were in fact null and void or that NewDay  reverted to 
the old terms when  he wouldnt  talk about  family circumstances. But Ive seen nothing  to 
show the terms and conditions of the account are null and void or that theyve been changed 
to allow  the three month interest  freeze  without Mr S knowledge or consent.
Although I recognise  Mr S has experienced continued and ongoing personal and financial 
problems I dont think NewDay has treated him unfairly or inappropriately. 
Consequently although I recognise Mr S frustration and strength of feeling I dont think  
NewDay has done anything wrong.  And I dont see any reason to change  the proposed  
outcome in this case. 
Ref: DRN67543473my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.
