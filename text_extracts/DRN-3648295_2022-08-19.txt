The complaint
Mr H complains about how PSA Finance UK Limited (PSA) managed and administered his 
hire purchase agreement (agreement).
What happened
In January 2019 Mr H entered into an agreement with PSA for a new car. The cash price of 
the car was £31,241.82 and the cash price of insurance(s) was £349  making a total cash 
price of £31,590.82.
Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr H undertook to make an 
advance payment of £12,445, 36 monthly payments of £173.55 (£170.39 plus £3.16) and a 
final payment of £16,013.91 (£15,722 plus £291.91) making a total repayable of £34,706.71 
(£34,301.04 plus £405.67) at an APR of 5.9%.
On 4 January 2019 Mr H paid £12,445. Between 3 February 2019 and 3 January 2022 
inclusive Mr H paid 36,247.80 (36 x £173.55) leaving a balance outstanding of £16,013.91 
payable on, or before, 3 February 2022.
On 6 October and 6 December 2021 PSA wrote to Mr H to outline his end of agreement 
options which included the following:
If youd like to buy your car at the end of your contract, all you need to do is make your final 
payment of 16,103.91 GBP on 03/02/2022. If you pay by Direct Debit, well apply for this 
automatically on the day.
On 14 January 2022 Mr H advised PSA that he was going to exercise his right to purchase 
the car and would like to send it a cheque/draft for £16,103.91.
On 26 January 2022 Mr H advised PSA that he had sent it a cheque/draft for £16,103.91 
(dated 24 January 2022).
On 28 January 2022 PSA received from Mr H his cheque/draft for £16,103.91.
On 4 February 2022 Mr H contacted PSA to say it had collected from his bank account (by 
way of direct debit) the sum of £16,103.91 meaning he had paid twice to purchase the car, 
once by cheque and once by direct debit.
On 14 February 2002, and after a number of communication exchanges between PSA and 
Mr H, PSA confirmed to Mr H that it had refunded to his bank account the sum of 
£16,103.91.
Following the refund of £16,103.91 PSA offered Mr H £50 compensation for any distress and 
inconvenience its decision to take payment twice had caused him as well as agreeing to 
refund any bank charges he had incurred (as a result) and could evidence.
Unhappy with PSAs response Mr H complained to our service.
Our investigator upheld Mr Hs complaint and found that PSA should pay him £150 for the 
distress and inconvenience its decision to take payment twice had caused. PSA accepted 
the investigators findings, but Mr H didnt. Therefore, Mr Hs complaint has been passed to 
me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same overall conclusion as the 
investigator and for broadly the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to 
what has already been said.
First I would like to make clear to Mr H to that were not the regulator of financial businesses, 
so we dont fine or punish businesses or monitor how they are operating in general or should 
do so in the future. Thats the job of the Financial Conduct Authority. My role is to look at 
whats happened in an individual case and seek to provide a fair and reasonable outcome.
Secondly I want to assure Mr H that Ive reviewed everything on file. And if I dont comment 
on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive concentrated on 
what I think are the key issues. Our powers allow me to do this.
I dont underestimate the distress and inconvenience this whole matter has caused Mr H. 
But given Mr H hasnt said that he suffered any direct financial loss as a result of PSA 
taking payment twice (such as bank charges or interest), when the direct debit sum of 
£16,103.91 was returned to Mr Hs bank account and that PSA confirmed to Mr H, almost 
immediately, it would refund the direct debit sum of £16,103.91 (it was just how quickly it 
would be able to do so that was unclear) Im satisfied that payment of £150 represents an 
appropriate compensation sum for PSA to have to pay Mr H in all the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that PSA Finance UK Limited must pay Mr H, to the extent it hasnt 
already done so, £150 for the distress and inconvenience its decision to take payment twice 
caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 September 2022.
