The complaint
Mrs F (by way of a representative) complains Short Term Finance Limited (STF) lent to her 
irresponsibly because she was in financial difficulties when these loans were approved.

Mrs F was given 21 home collected loans between December 2012 and December 2017.

Based on the limited information provided, it seems most of these loans were due to be 
repaid by 16 weekly payments. 
STF investigated Mrs Fs complaint and offered to put things right for loan 11 only. Unhappy 
with this offer, the complaint was referred to this Service. 
STF didnt think we could initially investigate some the above loans, because Mrs F 
complained too late. Another ombudsman has considered this objection and decided all 21 
loans could be considered. 
The adjudicator then reviewed the merits of the complaint. He didnt think STF had made an 
error when it approved loans 1  4. However, he concluded that by loan 5 STF ought to have 
realised the pattern of lending was harmful to Mrs F. So, loans 6 - 21 shouldnt have given. 
Mrs F appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, STF said;
STF believes it hasnt done anything wrong, 
SFT adhered to all the required guidelines before lending and
prior to November 2018 STFs agents didnt have the means to accept and keep 
copies of bank statements. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mrs F (or her representative) doesnt appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings about 
loans 1  4. So, I think there is no longer a dispute about these loans. And like the 
adjudicator, I would also agree, based on what Ive seen, that there isnt enough to uphold 
the complaint about those loans.  So instead, this decision will focus on whether STF did 
anything wrong when it lent loans 5 to 21.  
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs F could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mrs F. These factors include: 
Mrs F having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mrs F having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs F coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs F. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mrs Fs complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 5 - 21 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. Due to the passage of time, there is no available information 
about loans 5  7. So, I dont know what information STF gathered from Mrs F or what she 
declared. From loan 8, only sporadic information has been provided. 
I can also see for some of the loans  such as loan 8 that STF gathered information from 
Mrs F about her employment, living arrangements, income and expenditure. The application 
forms Ive seen dont suggest that STF ever looked at or reviewed her bank statements. But 
it would seem, based on the applications that Ive seen that STF wouldve thought it was 
likely that Mrs F wouldve been able to afford the repayments she was committed to paying 
for each loan (except for loan 11 which STF accepts shouldnt have been provided).  
But as Ive explained above, the loan being pound and pence affordable is only part of the 
consideration. So, I havent felt he need to recreate individual, proportionate affordability 
checks for these loans because I didnt consider it necessary to do so. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mrs F, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mrs F. Having looked at the overall pattern of 
STFs lending history with Mrs F, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it 
provided loan 5. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Mrs F was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs F had taken out 5 loans in almost 9 months and she had been 
indebted to STF for the entire time except for a few days between each loan. So STF 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs F was having to borrow further 
to cover an ongoing need and that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be 
improving. 
By loan 5 and over 9 months into the lending relationship, Mrs Fs weekly 
repayments had increased significantly. She started with a loan for £150 and loan 5 
was the largest to date at £400. This to suggests, that Mrs Fs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably, and she was likely needing further borrowing to cover 
ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to cover one-off purchases, for example. 
Mrs F took some loans around the same time previous ones were repaid, for 
example, loans 2 and 3. STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mrs F, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is an indicative of her indebtedness not being 
sustainable;
Mrs F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 21 was 
taken out over five years after Mrs Fs loan. And it was for more than twice as much 
as Mrs Fs first loan. Mrs F had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Mrs F lost out when STF provided loans 5 - 21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Fs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Fs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 5 - 21 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs F from loan 5 as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs F may have simply left matters there 
and not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, 
she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even 
possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs F in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs F would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Mrs F loans 5 - 21.
a) STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs F towards interest, 
fees and charges on loans 5  21. 
b) STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs F 
which were considered as part of a), calculated from the date Mrs F originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
c) The overall pattern of Mrs Fs borrowing about loan 5 - 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Fs credit file. *HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. STF should
give Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax STF has deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Fs complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right for Mrs F as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
