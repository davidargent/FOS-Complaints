DRN-3221923
The complaint
Mr and Mrs D complain that Bank of Ireland (UK) plc (BOI) wont reissue a cheque. They 
would like it to do so.
.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision .
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I appreciate Mr and Mrs D have evidenced an uncashed cheque for a significant sum 
of money. BOIs records are limited given the cheque was issued in 2020 . Thats  
understandable as banks dont have to keep records on an open-ended basis
BOI has told us that it hasnt been able to locate any record about this cheque in its 
out of date cheque listings which suggests that payment was made by a replacement 
cheque. I think thats very likely although as BOIs  records are limited due to the 
passage of time I cant be certain of this.
I appreciate Mr D and Mrs D have told us that around the time the cheque was 
issued they had difficult personal circumstances which might explain why the cheque 
wasnt cashed at that time. But the cheque was for a significant sum of money so I 
think its unlikely that, once their personal situation settled down,  they wouldnt have 
realised they hadnt had payment.
I dont think I can reasonably ask BOI to issue another cheque as I have no evidence 
to show that a replacement cheque wasnt issued which I think is the most likely 
scenario
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D and Mr D to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
