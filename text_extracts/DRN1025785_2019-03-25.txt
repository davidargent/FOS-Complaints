K820x#14complaint
Mrs M says Bank of Scotland  plc mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mrs M bought the policy in 2004 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs M disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Ms case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Ms complaint  because:
 I think Bank of Scotland made Mrs M aware that she had a choice about  buying  the 
PPI, and that she chose  to take it. 
 Bank of Scotland recommended the PPI to Mrs M, and it seems to have  been  right for 
her based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. 
 Its possible the information Bank of Scotland gave Mrs M about the PPI wasnt  as 
clear as it shouldve  been.  But Mrs M doesnt  appear to have been affected  by any of 
the main things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her 
circumstances it looks like the policy couldve been useful to her. So I dont think  better 
information wouldve  stopped  her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Ms comments and those of her representatives, including  about 
her sick pay entitlement.  But these  points dont change my conclusion. The PPI wouldve 
paid out on top of her sick pay, leaving that available for other  things. And it also covered  
unemployment, life and critical illness. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
