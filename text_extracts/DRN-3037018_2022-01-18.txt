The complaint
Mr G as the director of O complains that New Wave Capital Limited (New Wave) failed to 
refund two transactions made from his account that he didnt recognise.
What happened
Mr G had an evening out abroad between 2 and 3 February 2020. He went to various 
hospitality venues and ended the evening at a bar Ill call R. When Mr G checked his 
transactions, he noted two payments for £468.55 that he didnt recognise. The merchant was 
shown as R, but the letters SL appeared after R. The table below shows the transactions 
that were made that evening with the disputed transactions highlighted:
Date Time Location Method Amount 
02/02/20 20.59 1 Chip and PIN 2£22.75
02/02/20 21.18 2 Chip and PIN £52.70

03/02/20 04:36 R Chip and PIN £301.40
03/02/20 04:45 R SL Chip and PIN £468.55
Mr G contacted New Wave on 4 February 2020 to say that he didnt recognise the merchant 
or the two payments and asked if the payments were authorised by chip and PIN. New 
Wave confirmed they were, and suggested Mr G go back to the merchant. Mr G later 
contacted New Wave and said he recognised R but not R with SL after the name and 
confirmed he didnt make the disputed payments. He has suggested that his card was 
cloned or that staff at R saw him enter his PIN and used his card and PIN when they took it 
out of his sight to make genuine payments. 
New Wave completed an investigation but did not accept the transactions were made 
fraudulently. It said the transactions were authorised using Mr Gs unique pin. 
The investigator who considered the complaint didnt recommend that it be upheld. In 
summary, she was persuaded that Mr G authorised and consented to the payments. She felt 
R and R SL were the same establishment. The investigator noted that Mr G only handed his 
card to staff when he was making a payment but that there was a time difference between a 
genuine payment and a disputed one of twelve minutes for the first payment and nine for the 
second. The investigator also noted that the second disputed transaction was the last time 
Mr G used his card that night/morning, indicating he would have waited for it to be returned 
to him before he left the venue. Overall, the investigator was satisfied Mr G intended to make 
the two transactions. 
Mr G, on behalf of O, didnt agree with the investigator. He said the disputed payments dont 
fit his pattern of spending that night. In particular, the disputed payments were of greater 
value, to a different merchant (R SL rather than R) and that the time between the previous 
payment and the disputed payments was shorter than between genuine transactions. He 
explained that he always protects his PIN and has used a credit card for 25 years without 
experiencing this type of crime. Mr G said he didnt know how staff had been able to use his 
PIN but suggested the terminals could have been swapped or a fake keypad used to steal 
his PIN (as he had read an online article that explained this could happen). 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And where there is a dispute about what happened, and the evidence is incomplete or
contradictory, I must reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, on
what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available evidence.
The relevant law surrounding authorisations are the Payment Service Regulations 2017. The
basic position is that New Wave can hold O liable for the disputed payments if the evidence
suggests that its more likely than not that Mr G, on behalf of O, made or authorised them.
Authorisation is made up of two parts, authentication and consent. Authentication is usually 
referred to as the technical evidence and in this case, New Wave has supplied evidence that 
shows the genuine card and PIN were used to make the transactions. So, Im satisfied that 
the evidence shows the disputed transactions were authenticated.
Consent refers to the way in which New Wave and Mr G agreed to use the card for 
transactions. For example, when using the card and PIN together, New Wave agree to 
accept that this is a legitimate payment instruction made by the cardholder or another 
approved user and make the payment on their behalf. The transactions in this case used the 
genuine card and the correct PIN, so Im satisfied that consent was given, and the disputed 
transactions were authorised. 
Having looked at all the evidence and considered Mr Gs explanation carefully Im not
persuaded by what Mr G has said. And on balance Ive ruled out that a third-party fraudster
was responsible. Im satisfied that Mr G consented to the transactions he is disputing. So, I 
dont think it would be fair or reasonable to say New Wave needs to refund him. I say this for 
the following reasons:
-The technical evidence shows that the disputed payments were made using the card 
and PIN Mr G held for Os account. The PIN number is unique to Mr G and wouldnt 
have been known to third parties. Mr G has explained to this service he protects his 
PIN carefully and never shares it so on balance Im not persuaded staff noted Mr Gs 
PIN when he made genuine transactions. 
-Mr G confirms he was in possession of his bank card all evening, except for when 
staff took it out of his sight when he made genuine payments. But twelve minutes 
elapsed between an undisputed payment to R and the first disputed payment to R SL and nine minutes for the second. Im not persuaded Mr Gs card would have been out 
of his possession for so long without him noticing or questioning why it hadnt been 
returned to him.  
-Mr G has sought to differentiate the disputed transactions by saying the period 
between a genuine transaction and the two disputed transactions was much less 
than between any other transaction that night, the disputed transactions were for 
greater sums and the merchant name was different. But I note that a period of twelve 
minutes also elapsed between two genuine payments to R and that although the 
disputed transactions were a bit higher than other transactions they were for similar 
amounts. Mr G made four consecutive payments of £340.76 that he doesnt dispute 
on the same evening. So, I dont find two payments of £468.55 to be out of character 
with Mr Gs genuine spending that evening. And whilst Im uncertain why the 
merchant appears as R SL for the disputed transactions, I consider it more likely than 
not that all the transactions to R and to R SL were made at the same venue.  But 
regardless, as I cant see how a third party got access to Mr Gs PIN, Im persuaded 
that its more likely Mr G authorised the payments.
-Mr G has raised a point about his card potentially being cloned, and the cloned card 
used for the disputed transactions. But cloning involves the copying of the 
information on the magnetic strip on the back of the card to a new card. In this case, 
the evidence shows that the chip in Mr Gs card was read, which means Mr Gs 
genuine card was used. So Im not persuaded that Mr Gs card was cloned.
-Mr G has referred to an online article which explains how fraudsters can use a fake 
keypad that allows them to steal a cardholders PIN and use this information together 
with a stolen card to make purchases in the cardholders name. Ive seen nothing to 
suggest that this is what happened here. Im also mindful of the fact that only two 
transactions are disputed, and fraudsters would likely try to spend as much as 
possible. 
The evidence that Ive considered leads me to the conclusion that, on the balance of 
probabilities, it was more likely than not that Mr G on behalf of O authorised or allowed his 
card details to be used to make the payments. So, taking everything into account, I think its 
fair and reasonable for New Wave to hold O responsible for these transactions.
My final decision
For the reasons I have explained I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O and O to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 February 2022.
