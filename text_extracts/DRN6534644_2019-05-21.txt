K821x#15complaint
Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr C had four loans with QuickQuid. Loans  1, 2 and 3 were  payday loans, repayable in 
either one or three monthly payments. Mr C also had a FlexCredit facility,  which  allowed him 
to drawdown funds up to a fixed limit and repay those  drawdowns in up to ten monthly  
instalments. Ive summarised some of the information QuickQuid provided about the loans in 
the table below.
Loan no. Amount Start date End date
1 £50 20/09/2013 28/10/2013
2 £100 15/12/2013 27/12/2013
FlexCredit variable 08/03/2014 03/03/2015
3 £100 17/04/2015 30/06/2015
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld.  He didnt think  
QuickQuid was right to have approved the third payday loan in April 2015. QuickQuid didnt 
agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide. As Mr C accepted  
the outcome of the adjudication, Ill just look at the loan still in dispute   loan 3. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
When Mr C asked for loan 3, QuickQuid recorded  his net monthly  income as £1,000  and his 
total monthly expenditure as £925. This left him with monthly disposable income  of no more  
than £75.
Ref: DRN65346442Loan 3 was scheduled to be repaid  across  there  months,  as follows:
£10.40 due on 30 April 2015
£23.20 due on 29 May 2015
£125.60 due on 30 June 2015
So the largest payment exceeded Mr Cs disposable  monthly income.
QuickQuid says the total cost of the loan was £59.20  but thats only the interest charge. 
QuickQuid clearly expected Mr C to repay the principal borrowed too. So I need  to look at 
whether the loan was affordable with that in mind.
Its arguable the loan would be affordable if Mr C could save  income from April and May to 
make the June payment. But I dont think it would be reasonable for QuickQuid  to argue 
Mr C was likely to be in a position to save money.  Mr C had been borrowing from QuickQuid 
for over a year when he applied for loan 3, with a gap of just 45 days between the FlexCredit  
account and this new loan. This doesnt  suggest  he was in a position  to save  money from 
month to month.
And QuickQuids own estimate of Mr Cs monthly  disposable income was low too - £75 
doesnt leave  much margin for error,  or allow for any other  unknown  (i.e. expenditure 
QuickQuid didnt ask about)  or unexpected expenditure  which  might occur  at any time.
Ive also seen that Mr C had another short-term loan outstanding (for £110) before he took 
loan 3  and had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks,  its likely  it wouldve been 
aware of this; although I think  the loan was unaffordable even without taking this into 
account.
Based on the information QuickQuid obtained,  I think it ought to have realised Mr C was 
unlikely to be able to make the repayment  without undue difficulty  and would likely have to 
borrow again  from it, or elsewhere. So Im upholding Mr Cs complaint  about loan 3.
I should add that Ive noted QuickQuid made some comments about the changes it made to 
its lending processes, which were fully implemented before loan 3 was approved.  QuickQuid 
will be aware from previous decisions of what this Service has said on these points. Ive 
taken what it has said into account, but wont respond to these points here  particularly as 
the points raised  are not case-specific, and are not new and do not change  my decision.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr C paid on the loan of 17 April 2015
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr C paid them, until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  this loan from Mr Cs credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr C a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN65346443my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2019.
