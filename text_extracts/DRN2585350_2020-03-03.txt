Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Us complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the behaviour of his borrowing indicated he was 
suffering from financial difficulties. Sunny disagreed and but initially offered to uphold  Mr Us 
compliant from loan 13. Mr U disagreed. Sunny has since offered to uphold  from loan 9 but 
we havent received a response  from Mr U about this offer.   
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr U could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN25853502the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period during which  a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr U could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Us complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr U 
didnt respond  to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute about these loans, I 
wont be making any findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Mr U and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Us fifth loan in just under five months  and he 
was taking it out on the same day he repaid loan 4, I think  Sunny  should have been looking 
to build a clearer  picture  about Mr Us finances before lending  him this loan. 
Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that - as well as having outstanding loans still in place with Sunny - Mr U was also borrowing 
from another short-term  lender. The repayment  for this loan would have been increasing his 
monthly commitment. 
From the information provided, Mr U had two loans outstanding with Sunny when he took out 
loan 5  making  his monthly commitment to Sunny £178.40  which was almost  half his 
disposable income. This would have left Mr U around £200 disposable income  to cover any 
repayments to other lenders and for any emergencies or eventualities.  I dont think  this 
amount would have  been  enough given Mr Us history of having to take out new loans on a 
regular basis. So, I think Mr U would have struggled to make  his repayments sustainably.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr U, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN25853503was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Us case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr U was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr U had taken out six loans in under six months and Mr U had been 
indebted to Sunny  for all this time. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr U was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Us indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Us first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £150.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr U was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr U was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mr U wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  16 was 
taken out 17 months after Mr Us first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr U had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr U lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Us indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr U borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Us ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny are able to 
do so and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant  buy the debts back,  then Sunny 
should liaise  with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr U towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr U which  were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr U originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr U as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr U having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
Ref: DRN25853504calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr U. However,  if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr U. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Us credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Mr Us borrowing for loans 6 to 16 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from Mr Us 
credit file. Sunny does  not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Us credit  file until 
these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse information  recorded 
about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must give Mr U a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Us complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
