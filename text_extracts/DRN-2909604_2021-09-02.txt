The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, trading as Xoom, removed over £300 
from his account without authorisation.
What happened
Mr S has a PayPal account (not under the Xoom brand). In June 2020 he transferred £300 
from his PayPal account to his bank account. He says that the next day, £302.49 was 
removed from his bank account by Xoom.
Mr S complained to his bank, which raised a chargeback claim with Xoom, since the 
transaction was actually a credit card payment. Xoom successfully defended the claim by 
providing evidence that Mr S had sent the money to himself. (This had been a payment of 
£300, and a Xoom fee of £2.49.)
Mr S next brought a complaint about PayPal to our service. He insisted he had never had a 
Xoom account or used Xoom. He asked for a refund of the £302.49.
PayPal told our investigator it had nothing to do with Xoom, or with the transaction Mr S was 
complaining about (I will explain this in the next section). It suggested that Mr S take up the 
matter with Xoom directly, as Xoom was (then) a separate firm.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. He accepted that Xoom and PayPal were 
entirely separate entities (to be fair to him, the nature of the relationship between PayPal and 
Xoom was less clear at the time than it is now, and it appears to have changed recently). He 
said the bank statements provided by Mr Ss bank showed that the £300 credit to his 
account was described as a remittance by Xoom.com. So he thought there was no evidence 
that PayPal had ever been involved.
Mr S asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I looked up Xoom on the Financial Conduct Authoritys register, and I also looked at Xooms 
own website. Both of these make it clear that Xoom is now a part of PayPal. The FCAs 
register shows that Xoom has been a trading name of PayPal since 29 June 2021 (although 
Xoom still appears to be administered separately from the rest of PayPal). Im still not sure 
what the nature of their connection was before that date, although it appears to have been 
less close, since they seem to have been separate firms. Nevertheless, there must have 
been some connection before that date, since when Mr S transferred money from his (non-
Xoom) PayPal account to his bank account, his bank recorded this as a credit from 
Xoom.com and not from PayPal. But whatever the history of this connection, I am satisfied 
that today PayPal is the proper respondent to deal with this complaint, since Xoom is not 
separately authorised by the FCA (and does not seem to have its own complaint handlers).
However, I do not uphold this complaint, for the same reason that Mr Ss bank did not uphold 
his chargeback claim. Xoom has confirmed to me (via PayPals complaint handlers), and 
independently of Mr Ss bank, that the debit of £302.49 from Mr Ss bank account was a 
credit card payment of £300 to Mr S, and was authorised by him.
(Mr S complained to our service about how his bank dealt with the chargeback claim, and 
that complaint was not upheld. I have now seen the evidence Xoom sent to the bank to 
defend the claim, and I can see that the details of the sender and of the recipient of the 
payment match. They also match the details Mr S provided to our service.)
I infer that Mr S has either forgotten making this payment, or he did not recognise it because 
Xoom was not the final recipient of the funds but was just involved in the transaction, without 
him actually having a Xoom account. There is no basis on which I could order PayPal 
(trading as Xoom) to refund him.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
