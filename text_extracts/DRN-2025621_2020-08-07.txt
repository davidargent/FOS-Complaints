The complaint
Mr M complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) was 
irresponsible to lend him money he couldnt afford to pay back.
What happened
Mr M took out two loans with MoneyBoat - heres a table showing details: 
Mr M didn't feel that MoneyBoat properly carried out affordability checks before lending to 
him. He says these loans caused a debt spiral and led to repeat borrowing  making his 
already poor financial situation worse.
Our adjudicator felt that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided either of these loans to Mr M 
given that the checks MoneyBoat did showed that Mr M had an outstanding county court 
judgement against him for several thousand pounds when he asked for loan 1. And our 
adjudicator said Mr M also owed a lot of money elsewhere. So our adjudicator felt it wasnt 
likely that Mr M wouldve been able to sustainably repay loan 1  or any subsequent loans. 
Our adjudicator set out the steps she said MoneyBoat should take to put things right for 
Mr M. 
MoneyBoat mainly said it did proportionate checks  and that whilst we might say it 
should've looked at all the information it had, MoneyBoat said it was impractical to review 
every line of a credit file for every loan. MoneyBoat told us that in the early stages of a 
lending relationship its processes are automated.
It said that the court judgement dated back two years and it didnt agree that Mr Ms other 
credit commitments were large. MoneyBoat also said that Mr M had settled his court 
judgement by the time he took out loan 2 and his total borrowing had reduced. 
MoneyBoat has asked for a review so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision.

paidreasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
MoneyBoat asked Mr M to provide details of his income and to tell MoneyBoat what he 
normally spent each month. Looking at what MoneyBoat knew about Mr Ms income and 
expenditure, Mr M appeared to have more than £1200 of disposable income when he was 
applying for loan 1. But that information was clearly at odds with the information shown on its credit checks that 
MoneyBoat sent to us. 
I think that as MoneyBoat could see the extent of Mr Ms debt, which included a county court 
judgment for around £2,500 that had been outstanding for a couple of years already, this 
should reasonably have led MoneyBoat to the conclusion that the information Mr M had 
provided about his finances was highly inaccurate. I think MoneyBoat ought to have realised 
that it was likely that Mr M was facing serious problems managing his money.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely Mr M would be 
able to repay loan 1, or any subsequent loan, in a sustainable way. 
Although MoneyBoat says it did assess affordability and as a result provided Mr M with a 
smaller loan than hed applied for, this doesn't mean that the loans it did provide were 
affordable and fairly loaned to him. 
And, despite what MoneyBoat says about his updated financial situation, I think MoneyBoat 
shouldve also declined Mr Ms application for loan 2. Mr M took out loan 2 the same day that 
he paid loan 1  and he borrowed more money. So the fact that some of the debt appearing 
on his credit report had been paid doesnt mean that hed been able to pay this debt in a way 
that was sustainable for him or that it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to think that his 
financial situation had significantly improved. 
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely that Mr M would 
be able to repay either loan in a sustainable way. So, Im upholding Mr Ms complaint about 
both loans.
Putting things right
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt it should buy this back before doing what I have 
outlined below. If MoneyBoat isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the following:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans and treat any repayments made by Mr M as though they had been repayments 
of the principal. If this results in Mr M having made overpayments then these should 
be refunded with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
MoneyBoat should then refund the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" and move to 
step "E".D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" 
should be used to repay any outstanding balance remaining and any principal 
already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to 
Mr M. However if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr M. 
E. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Ms credit file for loans 1 and 2. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat) to take the steps set out above to put things right for Mr M.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 September 2020.
