K822xcomplaint
Miss B complains  that Capital One (Europe) plc have not refunded all the interest  they 
should have, after they refunded a transaction to her credit card account. The refund was 
given to Miss B, after she made a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974  
(CCA).
background 
In June 2018, Miss B used her credit card with Capital  One to pay a garage to service  her 
car. When she picked up her car, Miss B thought that the garage didnt do a thorough 
enough service, so she asked for her money back. Miss B did this by making a claim with 
Capital One under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA).
Capital One upheld the section 75 claim and after a delay, refunded  £185.76 to Miss B. 
This was made up of the £179 cost of the service and a payment of £6.76 for the interest  
which had accrued on the transaction.
Miss B wasnt happy with the refund, specifically about the amount of interest. So, she made 
a complaint to Capital  One. They looked  into Miss Bs concerns and in their final response 
they said that the interest refund was correct  for the payment made to the garage.  Capital 
One went on to explain  that as Miss B hadnt  repaid the total balance  of her account, interest 
was charged on all the remaining transactions.
Miss B didnt accept  that explanation and brought her case  to us. Our investigator concluded 
that Capital One should  increase  the amount of the interest refund to £16 and pay Miss B an 
additional £30, for the delay they caused  with the refund of the cost of the service.  This 
made a total of £225.
Capital One agreed  with the investigator but Miss B didnt. She says the interest  charged  to 
her account  was more  than what the investigator  had recommended.  The investigator wasnt 
persuaded by Miss Bs argument and without any other calculations, she didnt  change  her 
findings.
Miss B didnt accept  the investigators  conclusion and asked for her case  to be reviewed by 
an ombudsman for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have looked  at Miss Bs credit card account  statements,  to see what happened around the 
time of her section 75 claim, for the cost of the service. I have included the balance  and 
payment details, of those  statements,  in the summary below:

Miss B repaid the full balance, of her May 2018  credit card account  statement. In the four 
statements which followed, Miss B made partial  payments,  meaning  there  was still a balance 
outstanding. 
In the interest  charging information section of the credit card account statements sent to 
Miss B it says:
If the account is not fully cleared, interest  will be charged on the total value of the statement, 
and not just the outstanding balance.
Having considered the payment history  of Miss Bs account and the key features of her 
agreement, I think  Capital One were  able to apply interest in the months when the full 
statement balance wasnt repaid.
I have also considered if Miss Bs section 75 claim meant that Capital One should  have 
stopped interest  from being applied all of the transactions on her account. I think the 
outcome of Miss Bs section 75 claim was unknown, until Capital One had finished its 
investigation. I can understand  Miss Bs reluctance  to repay the full statement balance, while 
the claim was being investigated. But, I think repaying the full statement balance was the 
only way of being certain to avoid interest being  applied to the account.
Miss B also says that she didnt repay the full statement amount because of her disputes 
about two other transactions, where  she was expecting refunds. Ive considered Miss Bs 
argument, but I dont  think  this meant  Capital One should have prevented interest from being 
applied to her account. Because the full statement balance wasnt repaid, it meant interest  
was able to be applied to the account for the entire statement balance. I dont think  Capital 
One has treated  Miss B unfairly here, as their duty was to investigate the dispute and when 
and outcome is reached, make  a refund if necessary.
The payment to the garage of £179  is on the statement dated 22 July 2018. Capital One 
initially suspended  interest on this transaction.  Had Miss B repaid the full statement balance,  
I dont think any interest  would have been  added to her account. The successful  section 75 
claim would have then simply  passed back onto an account of her choice, for her to use as 
she wished. Instead,  the partial repayments  in the following months  mean that interest  has 
continued to accrue  on the relevant statemented transactions. Although I accept Miss B is 
unhappy to repay the current outstanding  balance, I dont  think Capital One made  an error in 
charging interest.
Capital One eventually paid £225 to Miss B to resolve this complaint. This amount was made  
up of the £179 payment to the garage, £16 in interest  accrued  on that payment and £30 for a 
delay in settling  the section 75 claim.  Miss B says that the interest refund is not enough.
We look at the information  provided by both sides of a complaint. We dont audit  accounts  
for the people who need to use. Rather, we rely on what evidence  each side shows  us to 
support their argument. 
Ive considered what Miss B and Capital One have said about  the refund of interest and the 
time it took for the refund  of £179  to be made. Ive also looked at the interest rate applied to 
Miss Bs credit card account.
Ref: DRN54222163Capital One have settled the section 75 claim and paid Miss B compensation for the delay in 
doing do. I think this offer is fair, so I dont think Capital One should increase it. In all the 
circumstances, I think  the interest payment covers  the period from when the transaction  to 
the garage was made, to when Capital  One settled the section  75 claim. Im not persuaded 
by what Miss B has shown us, that Capital One should increase the interest payment. So, I 
dont think Capital One needs  to take any further  action,  than it already has with Miss Bs 
complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 November 2019.
