K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that TransferWise  Ltd used a different exchange rate on a transaction to the 
rate he had agreed to.
background
Mr B sent Euros from his account  in Belgium to his United  Kingdom account using 
TransferWise on 1 November 2018.  He says he agreed a 48 hour guaranteed  exchange 
rate. But on 5 November 2018 at about 14.00 he received an e-mail from TransferWise  
saying it had received  his money and then another e-mail telling him that a different, less 
favourable exchange rate had been used. Mr B says as a result he lost about £526  but 
TransferWise refused to provide him with evidence that it received the money after the 48 
hour period had expired.  He also says TransferWise  should  have asked  him if he wished to 
proceed with the new exchange rate and that he could have cancelled  the transaction.
TransferWise doesnt accept making a mistake and says its acted in line with the transaction  
terms and conditions. It says it received the money outside the 48 hour window and isnt 
responsible for exchange rate movements. It also says Mr B should have been aware the 
money hadnt been received in time and could  have cancelled the transfer.  TransferWise  
says it may decide to e-mail a customer in these circumstances.
Mr B brought his complaint to us but our adjudicator didnt think  TransferWise had made  a 
mistake or acted unfairly.  The adjudicator  thought that TransferWise didnt receive the 
money within the 48 hour window to guarantee the exchange rate. And in line with the terms 
and conditions wasnt obliged  to tell Mr B that a different exchange rate would be used.
Mr B doesnt  accept that view and says TransferWise has acted outside the rules for treating 
customers fairly and communicating with them. He says the exchange rate change was so 
significant that TransferWise  should  have contacted him. Mr B says he had no chance  to 
cancel the transaction as the e-mail  he received didnt have details of the exchange rate. He 
would like the money he lost refunded to him.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator  for the same  reasons. I realise Mr B will be 
disappointed by my decision.
Ive looked at TransferWises  terms and conditions for this transaction.  And Im satisfied that 
the exchange rate was guaranteed for 48 hours ( excluding weekends)  which  expired at 
about 10.40 on 5 November 2018.  So I dont think TransferWise made a mistake by using  a 
different rate in circumstances where  I think it received the money outside that 48 hour 
window. I think the terms and conditions make clear  that money received outside the 48 hour 
window is converted  using  the exchange rate at the time which  of course could have been 
more favourable to Mr B. Im also satisfied that the terms and conditions say that 
TransferWise will convert at the rate at the time or email you to ask you if you wish to 
proceed. So again I dont think TransferWise made a mistake or acted outside  the terms 
and conditions by deciding not to contact Mr B before proceeding to convert his money.
I appreciate Mr B says TransferWise has acted contrary to the rules about  treating 
customers fairly and communicating with them. But whilst Im sorry to disagree with Mr B I 
Ref: DRN97979732think TransferWise made clear in its terms and conditions  what would happen in the event of 
money being received outside  the window. I also think that TransferWise wasnt responsible  
for when  the money was received or for changes in the exchange rate.
I can see that Mr B says he had no time to cancel the transaction and that TransferWise 
should have contacted him to give him the opportunity  to do so. I have  explained why I think 
TransferWise has acted  in line with the agreement.  But I also think that Mr B could have 
checked at the point  the 48 hour period  expired that TransferWise had received his money  
and decided in those circumstances if he wished to proceed.
We are not the regulator of TransferWise and so I cant  fairly tell it how it should conduct its 
business in this type of case or order it to tell its customers about currency  rate changes. 
Overall Im satisfied its provided  information  within its terms and conditions about  what  would 
happen if money was received outside of the 48 hour guarantee.  So I cant fairly or 
reasonably order  TransferWise to pay Mr B the money he lost of about £526.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2019.
