The complaint
Mr A complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) lent irresponsibly to him. 
 
What happened
Between December 2017 and June 2018, Mr A applied for two loans with MoneyBoat. The 
borrowing history is set out below.   
Loan Date taken Date repaid Amount 
requestedAmount 
borrowedTerm expected
1 01/12/17 06/02/18 £1500 £500 6 months
2 14/06/18 Outstanding as 
at 20/11/19£900 £750 5 months
As set out above, I understand there is an outstanding balance in respect of loan 2. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in respect of loan 2. He thought that 
the credit check MoneyBoat had undertaken would have shown Mr A couldnt sustainably 
repay that loan. MoneyBoat disagreed with that view. It said it wasnt reasonable to expect it 
to consider the credit report on a line by line basis.
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken that into account in deciding this case. 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. But I would 
still expect MoneyBoat to take account of the information it received  and that includes the 
credit report. 
Mr A didnt dispute what our adjudicator said about loan 1, so I havent considered further 
whether MoneyBoat was irresponsible to grant that loan. However, with regard to loan 2, I 
can see that when Mr A made that application, the credit report indicated a number of factors 
that should have reasonably put MoneyBoat on notice that Mr A was struggling financially. 
For example, I can see that hed missed repayments and his credit history was said to be 
impaired. Moreover, hed opened 12 credit accounts in the preceding 6 months and  had 
borrowed 93% of his credit limit for his revolving credit accounts. 
MoneyBoat argues that it shouldnt be expected to analyse a credit file line by line. Even if 
that were the case, the points I have highlighted above were clearly tabulated on the first two 
pages of the report. I do not consider a detailed analysis of the credit report was necessary 
to see that Mr A was probably in difficulty. Mr A had a significant number of other short-term 
loans. He had been late with a repayment for loan 1 and he had applied to borrow more than 
had been agreed for both loans 1 and 2. Putting that together with he information on the 
credit report, I think MoneyBoat should have realised that Mr A was in financial difficulties 
and he couldnt sustainably repay loan 2. 
For those reasons, I agree with our adjudicator and Im upholding the complaint in respect of 
loan 2. MoneyBoat will have to take action to put things right. 
Putting things right
As I said above, it appears there is an outstanding balance in respect of loan 2. If that is the 
case and MoneyBoat sold the outstanding debt to a third party, it must buy it back if it can 
and then follow the steps set out below. If it cannot buy the debt back, it must liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
 a) MoneyBoat must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance of loan 2, and 
treat any repayments made by Mr A as though they had been repayments of the principal on 
this loan. If this results in Mr A having made overpayments then MoneyBoat must refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated and paid on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
b) However, if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Mr A. It must not pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal it has already written-off. 
c) MoneyBoat must remove any adverse information recorded on Mr As credit file in relation 
to loan 2. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
MoneyBoat and Mr A do agree a repayment plan, Id remind MoneyBoat of its obligation to 
treat Mr A fairly.
My final decision
I have upheld the complaint in respect of loan 2. Evergreen Finance London Limited  trading 
as MoneyBoat.co.uk must comply with the above putting things right section. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
