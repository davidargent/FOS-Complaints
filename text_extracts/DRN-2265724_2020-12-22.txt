The complaint
Miss B has complained that Clydesdale Bank Plc trading as Virgin Money (Virgin) was slow 
to action her request to transfer her ISA.
 
What happened
In May 2019, Miss B signed a transfer form to transfer her Virgin ISA to another provider. 
This asked Virgin to provide a valuation of the ISA portfolio, and said that they would then be 
in touch with the transfer instructions. On 5 June 2019, Virgin sent account details to the new 
provider. This showed the balance, ISA account number and type of ISA. It did not show 
Miss Bs name. On 7 June 2019, the new provider sent the letter back and asked for details 
of the account holder. On 12 June 2019, Virgin resent the letter showing Miss Bs name in 
the heading. In November 2019, Miss B realised that the transfer hadnt taken place and 
contacted the new provider. It sent its transfer request to Virgin and the ISA was set up in 
December 2019.
Miss B complains that Virgin caused the delay in the transfer. Because of this she lost 
growth in the fund value by £2,081.81. She also doesnt believe the evidence that Virgin 
resent the letter on 12 June 2019. She complained to Virgin.
Virgin replied on 23 December 2019. It admitted that there was a delay of seven days as a 
result of the letter dated 5 June 2019 having to be resent on 12 June 2019 with the correct 
information. Virgin apologised for this delay and offered Miss T a goodwill payment of £50. It 
said that the new provider didnt contact it again until 28 November 2019 and the transfer 
was completed on 3 December 2019. 
Miss T complained to this service in February 2019. Our investigator said that in his view, 
Virgin had acted in line with the requests of the new provider. It had replied to the 
information request on 5 June 2019 with incomplete information, but he was satisfied that 
the letter had been amended with Miss Bs name and resent on 12 June 2019. He couldnt 
comment on why the new provider didnt get in touch with Virgin until November 2019.
Miss B asked that her complaint be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The important issue to look at here is what happened around the time of the transfer request 
in May and June 2019. The transfer request was dated 9 May 2019, signed by Miss B and 
addressed to Virgin. It was sent to Virgin by the new provider on 17 May 2019. The cover 
letter said please provide a current valuation of the ISA portfolio.once this information 
has been received I will be in touch with further instructions of the transfer. The transfer 
form itself says You should not affect [sic] the transfer until (new provider) authorised you 
to do so.
Virgins letter dated 5 June 2019 contained incomplete information as it didnt include Miss 
Bs name. Thats not in dispute. Virgin say they resent the letter on 12 June 2019. Miss B 
says that the new provider told her it didnt receive it. She says that Virgin didnt in fact 
resend the letter and is responsible for the delay in setting up the new ISA.
Virgin have provided a screenshot which it says shows that the letter dated 5 June 2019 was 
resent, together with a copy of the revised letter on 12 June 2019. Miss B says that she 
doesnt believe Virgin.
I have looked at the revised letter and screenshot. Virgin has explained that it resent the 
letter of 5 June 2019 but this time with Miss Bs name, as requested. That is reflected in a 
screenshot of its systems that show that on 12 June 2019 this is what happened. On that 
basis, I have no reason to doubt that the revised letter was sent. I dont know why the new 
provider didnt action the transfer at that time. But this complaint is against Virgin and so I 
can only consider its actions here. Having done so, Im satisfied that on balance, Virgin did 
send this letter as it says it did.
So I can appreciate that this whole episode has been frustrating for Miss B and I can also 
see that she feels strongly about what happened. But I cannot say in all fairness that Virgin 
did anything wrong here, beyond the small delay caused in reissuing the letter. So, 
impartially here, it wouldnt be fair for me to say it needs to do any more. It did offer Miss B 
compensation of £50 because of the seven-day delay in reissuing the letter in June 2019. I 
cannot see that this has been paid and so Miss T should contact Virgin directly if she now 
wishes to accept this.
 
My final decision
I dont think Clydesdale Bank Plc trading as Virgin Money needs to do anything to settle the 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 January 2021.
