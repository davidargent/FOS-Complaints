K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains of a delay in receiving  a payment into the current  account  he holds with 
National Westminster Bank Plc, and with the customer service it gave him in relation to that.
background
Mr T says he expected to receive a payment from a third party into his NatWest current  
account the same day it was sent to him, as he thought the payment was sent via the faster 
payments service. 
When he didnt receive payment  the same day, Mr T called NatWest. He says the agent he 
spoke to was rude and said hed need to talk to NatWests complaints team, and not a 
manager as Mr T had requested. Mr T says he swore in frustration  during  this call.
Mr T was unhappy with the customer service hed received in the call, so he complained to 
NatWest. In its final response,  NatWest thanked Mr T for raising this matter.  It said the call 
hadnt been recorded, possibly due to a system error, but that it accepted what  Mr T said.  It 
apologised and said it had given feedback  to the agent. It explained that while  Mr T may 
have sworn at the situation and not directly at its agent, swearing would result in calls being 
terminated. It offered  to talk to Mr T about its findings and gave referral rights  to our service.
Mr T disagreed. And he thought NatWests  final response blamed him for swearing without 
recognising that he swore  because of the frustration NatWest had caused him. So Mr T 
referred his complaint to our service.  NatWest couldnt provide a recording of the call in 
question, but it did provide recordings of other calls it had with Mr T around that time.
After looking into things  our investigator  said he didnt think  NatWest had caused any delay 
in payment. And that while it was unfortunate  a recording of the call wasnt  available, 
NatWest had acted  fairly  by accepting what Mr T said, and by apologising and giving 
feedback to its agent. He said that as Mr T said hed sworn in the call, it wasnt  unreasonable  
for NatWest to explain its policy in situations where a customer  swears.
Mr T disagreed, so his complaint has been  passed to me to make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding this 
complaint.
Mr T is unhappy  that NatWest delayed  a faster payment to his account.  Ive seen from his 
statement of account  that the payment was actually sent by BACS,  and not by the faster  
payment service.
 
BACS payments  can take between three to five days to arrive. Mr T says this payment took 
three days to arrive, which is within those timescales. And in this case, the method  of 
payment (BACS instead of faster payment) wasnt something NatWest  had any control over,  
as it was chosen by the payment sender.  For those reasons I cant  say NatWest caused  any 
delay to this payment.
Ref: DRN51610622Mr T is also unhappy with the customer service  NatWest gave him - he says its agent was 
rude when  he called and that its letter blamed  him for swearing in that call. 
The call in question isnt available,  which unfortunately can sometimes  happen. But in any 
case, NatWest has fully accepted what Mr T said about how that call went.  And its 
apologised and given  feedback to its agent. I think thats a fair and reasonable resolution in 
the circumstances so Im not asking NatWest to do anything more about  that.
Ive seen that NatWests  letter to Mr T does say it will terminate calls in situations where 
someone is swearing.  NatWest is entitled to decide  how it handles  such calls. Since 
Mr T himself accepts  he swore in his call to NatWest, I dont think it acted unfairly or 
unreasonably by advising Mr T of this. And I think it did so in a way that was polite and 
acknowledged Mr Ts concerns and frustrations. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 September 2019.
