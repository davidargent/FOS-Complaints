The complaint
Mr A complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement 
with Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, 
wasn't of satisfactory quality. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mercedes-Benz Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that 
it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr A - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr A was about four months old, had been driven for 500 
miles and had a price of Â£70,000;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Mr A in April 2018 and he says that Mercedes-Benz Finance 
was told about the issue with noise from the windscreen within six months and that it 
needs to provide the full dates of each technician seeing the car;
Mercedes-Benz Finance has provided evidence to show that the car was first 
returned to the dealer in November 2018 but the job card for that visit doesn't refer to 
an issue with the windscreen and that the next visit was in December 2018 and again 
the job card doesn't refer to an issue with the windscreen;
its evidence shows that the car was returned to the dealer again in March 2019 - 
when it's mileage was recorded as 11,726 - and the job card says: "Investigate 
whistle from windscreen area. [Named third party] have replaced the windscreen but 
there is a whistle";
I consider that the evidence shows that Mr A didn't tell Mercedes-Benz Finance 
about the issue with noise from the windscreen until March 2019 - after he'd paid a 
third party to replace the windscreen - and that was nearly a year after the car had 
been supplied to him and in that time he'd driven more than 11,000 miles in it;
Mr A has provided copies of the dealer's invoices from September and October 2019 
which refer to an unresolved wind noise but that was about a year and a half after the 
car had been supplied to him and the car's mileage was then recorded as being 
17,377;I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that there was a fault with 
the car's windscreen which created a noise issue when the car was supplied to Mr A 
or that it wasn't of satisfactory quality at that time because of such an issue;
if there had been a fault with the car when it was supplied to Mr A, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him to have raised it with the dealer much sooner 
than he did; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Mercedes-Benz Finance to pay for any issue with the windscreen to be 
remedied, to pay any compensation to Mr A or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
