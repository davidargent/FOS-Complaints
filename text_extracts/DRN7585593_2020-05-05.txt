K821x#15complaint
Mrs T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight loans Sunny provided  to Mrs T between  November 2015 and 
August 2017.  Mrs Ts borrowing history  is set out on the table below as follows:
LoanDate TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments AmountHighest 
Repayment  
Amount
1 25/11/2015 18/12/2015 6 £400 £117.57
2 21/12/2015 19/01/2016 6 £400 £119.73
3 12/01/2017 21/02/2017 6 £200 £52.16
4 14/02/2017 21/03/2017 6 £100 £82.40
5 16/03/2017 21/04/2017 6 £200 £91.27
6 25/06/2017 11/08/2017 6 £400 £115.58
7 03/08/2017 04/08/2017 6 £100 £143.34
8 15/08/2017 21/09/2017 6 £300 £91.95
The highest  repayment amount shown on the table  represents the highest contractual 
repayment due when there  were overlapping loans. The table  also shows a gap of 
approximately one year between Mrs T repaying  loan 2 and taking out loan 3.
Our adjudicator said that he hadnt seen  enough  to say it was unfair  for Sunny  to give Mrs T 
loans 1-6. But he said loans 7 and 8 should not have been  provided to Mrs T.
Sunny disagreed but said it would refund Mrs T loans 7 and 8 as a goodwill gesture without 
interest of 8%. So Sunnys  offer was not in line with our adjudicators  view.
Before being passed to an ombudsman  a further review of this complaint was carried  out. In 
our latest  assessment our adjudicator said that he didnt agree that loan 7 shouldnt have 
been provided. This time he agreed  that loan 8 should not have  been  given and he also said 
loan 4 shouldnt  have been given.
Neither party has responded to our latest view and so the complaint has been passed to me 
for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
Ref: DRN75855932different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ts complaint. Ive decided to agree with our latest 
assessment and uphold loan 4 and loan 8. I will explain why.
As Ive explained above there  were  two chains of lending. Between  the time Mrs T repaid  
loan 2 and took out loan 3 there was a gap of nearly  one year. So early  in the lending 
relationship I think Sunny  did enough  checks. For loans 1 and 2 Mrs T provided her income  
as £2,074 and for loan 3 Mrs T told Sunny her income was £2,852.  Mrs T also told Sunny 
her expenditure for loan 1 was £1,279,  loan 2- £1,266  and for loan 3 she told Sunny her 
outgoings were  £1,827.  On balance I think Sunny carried  out enough checks. There  was 
nothing in the information Mrs T had provided  which might have alerted it to the fact that 
Mrs T was having problems managing her money  or that she couldnt afford the repayments 
for these  loans So I cant say it was unfair  for Sunny to provided loans 1-3 to Mrs T.
Looking at loan 4 however, I can see that Mrs T told Sunny her income was £2,852 but this 
time her expenditure had also substantially increased. Mrs T reported to Sunny that her 
expenditure was £2,757. Mrs T had also not fully repaid loan 3 when she took out loan 4 so 
once she had made the repayments for loan 4 of £82.40,  she would have been left with a 
Ref: DRN75855933small sum of around £12.60 which she could use to repay any expenses. I dont think this 
left her with enough  disposable income  for unforeseen  bills she might  have  had to pay. 
Mrs T would have also had to repay this sum for five months  or more  so I dont think  this 
was a sustainable cost either. So, I agree with our latest assessment that loan 4 shouldnt 
have been given.
Turning next to loans 5  7 I think this time Sunny should have done  further  checks. I can 
see this time Mrs T told Sunny her income was £2,852  the same  amount as she had 
declared for loans 3 and 4. This time though Mrs Ts reported  expenditure had reduced  
substantially. She gave her outgoings for loan 5 as £800, £775 for loan 6 and £941 for loan 
7 so on the face of it there was nothing which might have alerted Sunny to Mrs T having  
problems managing her money. But considering loan 5 was given when loan 4 was still 
outstanding and less than one month  from when Mrs T took out loan 3, I think  Sunny should  
have at this point verified the information Mrs T was providing but as Ive not seen anything  
further about Mrs Ts circumstances at the time, I cant say it was unfair for Sunny to give 
loans 5-7.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs T was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs T had taken out 6 loans within seven months. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs T was having  to borrow further  to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Mrs Ts indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
Mrs Ts first loan was for £200 and loan 8 was for £300. So, it doesnt  look like 
Mrs Ts need  for cash  was reducing which also points to a longer term need for 
funds. At this point  Sunny ought  to have known that Mrs T was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mrs T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  8 was 
taken out seven months after Mrs Ts first loan in this chain of borrowing. And it was 
for a larger amount.  Mrs T had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mrs T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ts indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN75855934So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 and 8 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs T paid on loans  4 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 from Mrs Ts credit file;
any information recorded about  loan 8 is adverse. So all entries about loan 8 should 
be removed from Mrs Ts credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.
