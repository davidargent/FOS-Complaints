DRN-1921160
The complaint
Mrs D complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
RCI Financial Services Limited, trading as Renault Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality 
and is unsuitable for her needs.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the car was supplied to Mrs D under a hire purchase with Renault Finance that she 
signed in November 2018;
Renault Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was 
of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs D was  a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for her to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mrs D complained to Renault Finance about issues with the diesel particulate filter 
and that the car wasnt suitable for her - but it said in September 2019 that the dealer 
had serviced the car twice, it has been driven for more than 20,000 miles and the 
dealer hadnt regenerated the filter;
Mrs D says that the filter warning light and engine management warning light come 
on about every six weeks and she takes the car to a local garage for the required 
work and that its unsuitable for her needs;
I sympathise with Mrs D for the frustration and disappointment that she clearly feels 
about the car  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
there's a fault with the cars diesel particulate filter or that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to her; 
regeneration of a diesel particulate filter is a well known and understood requirement 
on diesel cars and Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for the dealer to 
explain that requirement to Mrs D before the car was supplied to her;
nor am I persuaded that the requirement to regenerate the filter causes the car not to 
be fit for purpose; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Renault Finance to allow Mrs D to reject the car, to pay pay her any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2020.
