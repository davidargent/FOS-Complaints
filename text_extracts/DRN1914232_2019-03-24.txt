K822xcomplaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie,SCA didnt provide him with buyer protection 
when he bought items online and then failed to investigate his complaint.
background 
Mr T bought  items on 19 November 2018  for £21.70. He says some of the items  were not 
delivered and some not as described and he was entitled to buyer protection with PayPal. Mr 
T says he raised this with PayPal but it didnt  carry out an investigation and as a result  he 
suffered distress and inconvenience. He would like PayPal to acknowledge its mistake.
PayPal says Mr T raised a claim  on 30 November  2018 on the grounds that he hadnt 
received the items he bought. It says it contacted the seller but the seller provided evidence  
that the items had been delivered to Mr T. PayPal  says it closed the case  and could see that 
the seller did refund  £11.01 to Mr T.
PayPal says Mr T raised a complaint reason as non receipt  but should  have  used the 
alternative reason  of significantly not as described. It accepts Mr T may have made a 
mistake and has offered  him a gesture of goodwill payment of £10.69 which  is the balance  of 
the payment.
Mr T brought  his complaint to us but our investigator  didnt think  PayPal had made  a mistake 
and had dealt  fairly  with this complaint. He thought PayPal  couldnt be held responsible for 
Mr T selecting the wrong complaint  category.  And thought the gesture of goodwill offer was 
fair and reasonable.
Mr T doesnt accept that view and says its not obvious which  complaint type to select  in this 
case. He says he explained in the messages with the seller what  the problem was and 
PayPal should  have known that. Mr T says PayPal shouldnt have closed the case  and that 
wouldve avoided his distress.
PayPal has said its not privy to the conversations between a buyer and seller and it was Mr 
Ts responsibility to ensure the complaint  category reflected  the issues.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the investigator  for largely  the same reasons.  I realise Mr T will 
disappointed by my decision.
There is no real doubt here that Mr Ts complaint was raised on the basis he hadnt received 
the goods he bought.  So I dont think PayPal made a mistake by closing the complaint when 
it carried out an investigation and concluded that Mr T had received the delivery. I appreciate  
Mr T says not all of the ordered items were present but I dont think  PayPal wouldve known 
that unless he selected the correct complaint category. I also appreciate that Mr T says its 
not obvious which category to select.  But I think  PayPal  has fairly accepted that Mr T may 
have made  a mistake  and has made  a fair and reasonable gesture of goodwill offer to pay 
the balance of the transaction  of £10.69.
Ref: DRN19142322I dont accept that PayPal should have been aware  of the true nature of the dispute  as I 
dont think it would have  been privy to the online  conversations  between  Mr T and the seller. 
I also dont think PayPal  should have done any more to investigate  what  had happened  and 
its entitled to rely on the information  its given.
Im satisfied that Mr T has received a partial  refund from the seller,  no doubt for those  items  
that were missing or not as described. So I cant see that Mr T has lost out as a result of 
what happened and I leave it to him to decide if he wishes to accept PayPals gesture of 
goodwill offer.
I appreciate Mr T says PayPals systems shouldnt be so complicated. But I make  it clear I 
think such matters are for a business  to decide upon  when exercising its commercial  
judgement and not something I can fairly interfere in. 
Overall I find PayPal  has dealt with this complaint fairly and hasnt made a mistake. Mr Ts 
acceptance of PayPals offer would be in full and final settlement of this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 April 2019.
