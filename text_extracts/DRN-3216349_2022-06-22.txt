The complaint
Mr D complains about the way NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua handled his chargeback claim.
What happened
In November 2020 Mr D ordered some items from an online supplier and paid using his 
NewDay card.
One of the items in the order didnt arrive. So Mr D contacted NewDay to raise a 
chargeback. NewDay raised a chargeback dispute and the sum of £1116.55 was credited to 
Mr Ds account.
Subsequently, the sum of £754.91 was debited from Mr Ds account. NewDay said that Mr D 
had raised the chargeback for an incorrect amount.
Mr D complained to NewDay. In response, it said it hadnt made an error. Mr D remained 
unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator partially upheld the complaint. He said that Mr D had disputed the full 
amount of the transaction but that because the order comprised of four items and only one of 
the items wasnt received, it was right that NewDay should only refund the cost of the item 
which wasnt received.
Mr D didnt agree. He said he never received the item and he never received the refund.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the order and the invoice. This shows that Mr D ordered four items  an intel 
processor, a motherboard, a memory kit and an evo plus. The total cost of the items 
including VAT was £1116.55.
When Mr D raised his chargeback claim he raised it for the total cost of all four items - 
£1116.55. This sum was credited to his account by NewDay.
Mr D has said that he never received the intel processor. The cost of this item was £361.64 
plus VAT (£433.97)
The other three items were received by Mr D. So the chargeback claim should have been 
raised for £433.97, and not for £1116.55. This is why NewDay later debited £754.91 from Mr 
Ds account (£1116.55 minus £361.64 equals £754.91)
I appreciate that Mr D may have found it confusing to have these credits and debits on his 
account. But having looked at what happened, Im satisfied that Mr D should only have been 
credited for the cost of the intel processor (£433.97). However, based on what Ive seen, I 
dont think NewDay credited the correct amount, because it refunded the net cost of the 
processor rather than the gross cost. It still needs to refund the VAT element of  £72.33.
Putting things right
To put things right NewDay should refund a further £72.33.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold the complaint. NewDay  Ltd trading as Aqua must 
refund £72.33 to Mr D.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
