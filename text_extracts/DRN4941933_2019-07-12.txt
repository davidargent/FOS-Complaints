K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. He said he 
was financially vulnerable at the time and so QuickQuid shouldnt  have approved  any loans. 
background
This complaint is about 11 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr H between  
November 2010  and April 2013. Mr Hs lending history is as follows:

QuickQuid didnt think that the financial Ombudsman Service should look at loans 1 to 4 as 
the complaint  was made too late. After  some correspondence Mr H has withdrawn  his 
complaint about  these  loans.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint and thought  that loans 5 to 11 shouldnt  have been 
given. 
QuickQuid didnt fully agree  with what our adjudicator said. But it did offer to pay 
compensation in respect of loan 11. It also said that it shouldve done more  before approving 
loans 6 to 9 but it didnt offer to pay any compensation. And it said the break in lending 
between loans 9 and 10 was long enough for it not to uphold  loan 10. 
Mr H didnt accept this offer and the complaint was passed to me  an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
Ref: DRN49419332number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to also say that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H continued to borrow from QuickQuid  with very little break between the loans. I can see 
there was a period of over 4 months  between  the end of loan 10 and the start of loan 11. But 
Mr H had been borrowing  from QuickQuid  for over 2 years at this time. So I dont think its 
reasonable to say this was a significant break  in the lending. And I think  all of loans 5 to 11 
should be considered to be continuous borrowing.   
After the increase to loan 5 Mr H needed to repay  just under £400 the month  after taking it. 
This was not far short of half of his declared income  of £900. This was the sixth lending point 
in total and the amounts  Mr H was borrowing had increased significantly from loan 1 where 
he borrowed  £50.  
So I think QuickQuid couldve realised at that time, and going forward, that Mr H may have 
some longer  term financial problems rather than just using the loans to help with a temporary  
cash flow problem. QuickQuid shouldve also become concerned  about  whether it knew  
enough about Mr Hs true financial  situation.
Ref: DRN49419333I think that before approving loan 5 it wouldve been  proportionate to find out about  Mr Hs 
normal monthly living costs and regular financial commitments including  any existing short-
term lending. And before  approving loan 6 it needed to fully review his financial situation.  
This is to make  sure Mr H was in position to make the repayments  sustainably.
I dont think QuickQuid did this. As far as I can see it asked Mr H about  his income and 
looked at some credit reference agency data.  It didnt  find out about his expenditure, or 
review his financial circumstances  further.  So I need to think  about what QuickQuid wouldve 
seen if it had carried out proportionate checks.
Mr H has provided some  information about his financial  circumstances which  includes his 
bank statements. I accept  that this isnt exactly what QuickQuid wouldve seen at the time. 
But I think it wouldve found  out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I 
think its reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that Mr H was having  problems managing his money.  It looks like the income  
QuickQuid recorded  for him was about right. But Mr Hs normal  expenditure was not far short  
of his income. And he was borrowing and repaying significant amounts  to other short  term 
lenders. So its reasonable  to say that his income was either  at, or greater than, his 
expenditure before QuickQuid approved the loans.  
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks.  And  I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr H wouldnt have been  able repay the loans 
in a sustainable way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loans 5 and 6 to Mr H 
and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about these 
loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
From  loan 2 onwards  Mr H was usually provided  with a new loan within days or 
weeks of settling  a previous  one. So QuickQuid ought to have realised by loan 7 it 
was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amounts he owed QuickQuid. Loan  11 
was taken out over two years  after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr H 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.  QuickQuids  records show that Mr H borrowed for 2.4 years in total. 
He borrowed £2,400 and paid over £1,100  in interest. 
I think that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN49419334the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 11 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 and 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 and 6 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 7 to 11 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 August 2019.
