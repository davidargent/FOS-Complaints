The complaint
Mr J complains that Santander UK Plc made changes to its telephone banking system which 
have made it less secure. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Santander says it changed the process for logging into telephone banking which
meant the One Time Passcode was no longer required each time. Santander is free
to decide what security procedures it has in place and how to protect its customers
accounts. Santander says the changes have been made in line with new regulations.
Mr J has asked for Santander to confirm how they meet or exceed regulations
relating to account security. But I wouldnt expect a business to give a detailed
explanation of the security processes it has in place and Im satisfied Santander has
set out its position to Mr J.
Im satisfied Santander has dealt with Mr Js complaint fairly, so Im not telling it to
take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
