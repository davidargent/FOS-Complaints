K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains about the administration of his credit card account  by Nationwide  Building  
Society (Nationwide).
background
In a letter to our service  dated 15 August 2018,  Mr H complained that:
On 4 May 2018 Nationwide  debited £369.31 from another account (for the credit  to 
his credit card account) without notice.
Nationwide had failed  to credit each and every monthly payment of £40 he had made 
to his credit card account for three years. His account balance  should be less than 
£9,000, not the £9,711.42 recorded  by Nationwide.
Nationwide had added interest  to his credit account without his agreement.
He had paid,  over the last ten years, in excess  of £9,000 in interest.
Nationwide issued Mr H with a final response  letter on 15 June 2018. It, in line with Mr Hs 
letter to it dated  2 June 2018,  addressed  the first point noted above.
This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Nationwide,  
in respect of the first point  noted above,  had done  nothing wrong.
Mr H didnt agree and said that the investigator  had failed to investigate his second 
complaint point about Nationwides  failure  to credit each and every monthly payment of £40 
he had made to his credit  card account for three years and his third and fourth complaint 
points about the amount of interest he had been  charged and/or paid.
The investigator responded to say that she was satisfied that Nationwide  had correctly 
accounted for each  and every payment made  by Mr H of £40 (18 in total)  over three  years. 
She also said that any complaint Mr H had about interest charged to his account,  or paid by 
him (third  and fourth complaint  points noted  above) would need  to be raised with Nationwide  
as a separate and new complaint, at least in the first instance.
Mr H responded to say that the investigator couldnt  reasonably conclude that he had only 
made 18 monthly payments of £40 (£720  in total)  when she hadnt seen all his statements 
for the three  year period in question.
The investigator wasnt persuaded  to change her mind so the complaint has been  passed to 
me for review and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For the avoidance of doubt I would like to confirm that Im only considering in this decision 
the following  two complaint points raised by Mr H:
The debit  of £369.31 from another account  (for the credit to Mr Hs credit  card 
account) on 4 May 2019 without notice.
Ref: DRN33695492The failure by Nationwide to credit each  and every monthly payment of £40 he says 
he made to his credit card account over three  years.
As pointed  out by the investigator  any complaint  Mr H might have about interest charged to 
his account, or paid by him, would  need  to be raised with Nationwide as a separate  and new 
complaint, at least in the first instance.
the debit of £369.31 from another account  on 4 May 2019
On 4 May 2018  Nationwide  debited another account  with £369.31 and credited this sum to 
Mr Hs credit card account.
I appreciate that Mr H says he didnt  receive  Nationwides letter  dated  10 April 2018  
confirming this was its intention. But Im satisfied, having considered  everything  both parties 
have said and submitted,  that this letter was sent to Mr H. And in considering complaints of 
this type I only need  to be satisfied this letter was sent, not that it was received.
For the sake of completeness I would also add that Im satisfied that the account  from which  
the debit was made was held by Mr H in his sole name, that both the accounts  in question 
allowed for such a debit and credit  to be made  and that by making  such  a debit and credit, 
Nationwide acted both fairly and reasonably.
the credit  of £40 payments
Mr H says he has made, in the last three  years  or so, more than 18 monthly  payments of 
£40 (£720). However having looked at Mr Hs credit card statements for the period 
June 2014 to January 2019 (copies  which I understand have now been  provided to Mr H) 
Ive only been  able, like the investigator, to identify 18 such  payments, albeit Ive also been  
able to identify  21 other  payments of between  £200  and £400  having been made.
Given this, and given  that Mr H has been unable  to provide any documentary  evidence to 
the contrary, Im satisfied  that Nationwide has accounted correctly for each and every £40 
payment made by Mr H over the last three  years  or so.
So in summary Im satisfied that Nationwide has done nothing wrong in debiting  the £369.31 
it did from another account, and crediting the same  sum to Mr Hs credit  card account, or in 
crediting the number of £40 payments it did to Mr Hs credit card account for the last three  
years or so.
Ref: DRN33695493my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2019.
