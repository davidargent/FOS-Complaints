The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as T, complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited has unfairly 
charged it £2,496 of transaction authorisation fees. T is represented in bringing this 
complaint by one of its directors, who Ill refer to as Mr L. 
What happened
T is an online business. It accepts card payments on its website, using WorldPay as its 
merchant acquirer and a third party as its payment services provider (PSP). 
In March 2021, T received an invoice from WorldPay, which contained an unexpected 
£2,496 of charges labelled as miscellaneous. 
T complained to WorldPay, which said that the charges were authorisation fees relating to 
numerous small card transaction attempts  an activity known as high volume card testing. 
WorldPay declined to refund the charges and suggested that T speak to its PSP to improve 
transaction-processing security and prevent it happening again. 
Ts PSP said that it wasnt their responsibility either. They suggested T implement security 
measures on its website. 
T referred its complaint to our service. It said that it didnt seem fair that both parties involved 
in processing its transactions denied responsibility. T was concerned that the companies 
concerned hadnt taken any steps to rectify problems in their own systems. 
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. She investigated the terms of Ts 
agreement with WorldPay and concluded that it wouldnt be fair to hold WorldPay 
responsible for the charges. 
T disagreed with our investigator and asked for an ombudsman to look at things again. Mr L 
made the following points: 
WorldPays charges either represented a passing on of its administrative costs or 
they included a profit element. 
Was it fair for WorldPay to pass on its administrative costs? 
If there was a profit element, was it fair for WorldPay to profit from this activity? 
Our investigator had concluded that T should improve its security for accepting 
payments. But we hadnt considered what was already in place or what was practical 
to implement. 
Mr L mentioned Ts significant commitment to web security and the amount of staff 
and technological solutions it already had in place. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think both sides agree that its likely T has been the victim of a technique known as high 
volume card-testing. This is where fraudsters attempt a large number of low value payments 
with an online merchant to check if stolen card details are still valid or to search for valid card 
numbers. Automated bots or scripts are often used to carry out a large amount of card-
testing transactions in a very short period of time. 
The decision for me is whether its fair and reasonable for WorldPay to charge T an 
authorisation fee in these circumstances. 
First, I think its worth me setting out that Im not aware of any regulations that specifically 
require merchant acquirers to do anything to protect their customers from card-testing. Im 
also not aware of any regulations that prevent the acquirer from charging for them.
My starting point is therefore to look at the terms of the contract between WorldPay and T. 
But Ive also considered how transactions are processed and whether its reasonable to rely 
on the contract in the specific circumstances of this case. 
The contract between WorldPay and T comprises several documents, including the 
Merchant Services Agreement (MSA), Pricing Schedule and the Customer Operating 
Instructions. These documents collectively set out the responsibilities and liabilities of the 
parties. The first thing I have considered is whether WorldPay has complied with the terms of 
this agreement. 
I havent seen evidence of the original imposition of the authorisation fee, but I dont think T 
disputes that it knew about this. I have seen evidence that WorldPay wrote to T informing it 
that they were increasing the authorisation fee to 4.5p per transaction in December 2017. 
And Ive seen that WorldPay said they were doing this in line with increased costs from 
Visa. 
WorldPay gave T two months notice of the increase in fees and gave T the option to 
terminate the contract immediately for no additional charge, if it wasnt prepared to accept 
the changes. Im satisfied that this increase was permitted by the MSA and made in 
accordance with its requirements. 
Having examined the documentation, my conclusion is that the contract permits WorldPay to 
charge a fee for each authorisation attempt. There is no exception for card testing. And T 
was given due notice of the increase in the fee and didnt object. 
The MSA also says that the merchant (in this case T) is solely responsible for establishing 
and applying adequate security systems and procedures. And the merchant is responsible 
for all losses resulting from any unauthorised activity. I think this makes it clear that 
WorldPay dont accept responsibility for attacks on the security of Ts payment 
arrangements. 
I have considered whether WorldPay should nonetheless have taken further steps to prevent 
this type of activity from happening. My conclusion is that I dont think it would be fair to 
expect this. Ill explain why next. T uses a third-party PSP to submit all payment requests to the relevant card company, which 
then authorises or declines them. WorldPays role only becomes active when the PSP 
passes on the transaction information to WorldPay via a nightly bulk transmission. Its at that 
point that WorldPay then processes the transactions, requesting funds from the cardholders 
for authorised transactions and then crediting Ts merchant account. 
I think its clear from the above that WorldPay receives the transaction details in arrears. It is 
therefore too late for it to take any action to stop card-testing occurring in real time. 
I also note that WorldPays Customer Operating Instructions cover card-testing specifically 
and offer some guidance on potential safety measures for merchants and their PSPs to 
consider. 
Im afraid Im not able to offer technological solutions. Its possible that there may be 
additional controls WorldPay could hypothetically put in place to try and identify card-testing 
activity through its acquiring account. But any such checks would inevitably slow down 
processing and introduce additional steps in the merchant acquiring process, thereby 
incurring further costs. Im satisfied that WorldPay arent obliged to take on this 
responsibility. Neither do I think it is unfair of them not to do so, given that the contract 
makes it clear that they arent responsible. 
I appreciate that T is an online business and it has told us that it employs specialists and has 
put in place a number of steps to try and safeguard its website. It may not find WorldPays 
advice in the Customer Operating Instructions particularly helpful. But I have some sympathy 
with the argument that WorldPays role occurs at the end of the process and they are 
therefore not the best placed to implement any such safeguards. 
I think its also worth mentioning that WorldPay are not the only merchant acquirer to include 
authorisation fees in their contract. Nor are they the only merchant acquirer to charge these 
fees for declined transactions, including those that look likely to stem from to card-testing. So 
I dont think WorldPays actions in this case are out of line with typical industry practice. 
I do sympathise with T, which has been the victim of an unexpected attack on its website. It 
has been left feeling exposed and vulnerable, despite its efforts to secure its website. I 
understand why it would like more protection from this type of attack.
I know T would like me to consider the exact cost to WorldPay of processing these 
transaction attempts and to compare it with the charges imposed on WorldPay by the card 
companies. But it isnt my role to tell WorldPay how to conduct their business or what 
charges to apply, but rather to decide whether they have acted fairly in the circumstances of 
this particular case. In any case, merchant services contracts contain a number of different 
and overlapping variables which are charged for. In my view, it wouldnt necessarily be 
reasonable to extract one element and expect it to link directly to the cost to the provider. 
Ultimately, merchant services are provided in the open market and T can exit its contract if it 
wishes. 
In summary, Ive found that WorldPay is entitled to charge an authorisation fee for every 
transaction attempt under the terms of the agreement T signed. WorldPay, in their role as 
merchant acquirer, were responsible for processing transactions and didnt have control over 
Ts website or the PSP. In the absence of any error on the part of WorldPay, I dont consider 
I can reasonably require it to refund the fees. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2022.
