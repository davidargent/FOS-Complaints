K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that LeasePlan UK Limited  paid parking fines  on his account without telling 
him. He says this denied  him the opportunity to appeal the fines.  Hes also unhappy that 
LeasePlan charged him a £40 administration fee for each fine he incurred, and that this 
wasnt refunded to him even when he successfully appealed one of the fines.
background
In February 2016  Mr K was supplied with a car and entered into a hire agreement  with 
LeasePlan.
Mr K is unhappy that LeasePlan  paid fines on his account without telling him. Hes also 
unhappy that an administration fee of £40 was charged to his account in respect of each 
fine, and that LeasePlan refused to refund this when he successfully appealed one of the 
fines.
Mr K says that as a result of LeasePlan paying  the fines on his account, his agreement  fell 
into arrears because he was left with insufficient funds to meet his contractual  monthly  
instalment.
Mr K contacted LeasePlan when his agreement fell into arrears. He told the call handler he 
was unhappy  that the parking fines had been  paid from his account and said he wanted to 
appeal the fines. The call handler advised Mr K that he could ask his bank to request a direct  
debit indemnity.
Mr K claimed indemnity for all of the fines which had been paid from his account.  He didnt 
realise that this would create arrears on his account and says that LeasePlan didnt warn 
him of the impact this might have  on his credit file.
In its final response,  LeasePlan  said that when Mr K said that he intended to claim an 
indemnity for the parking fines, he also said that he would  pay the arrears on his account. 
LeasePlan said it made Mr K aware  of the consequences of invoices remaining unpaid  on 
the account. It also said that Mr K was obliged to pay all fines under the terms of the 
agreement and that if LeasePlan paid fines on his behalf it was entitled to charge an 
administration fee.
Mr K wasnt  happy with the response so he complained  to this service.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. He said that the terms and conditions of the 
agreement permitted LeasePlan  to pay any fines incurred and charge an administration fee. 
He also said that whilst  he accepted that it wasnt Mr Ks intention  to put himself in further  
arrears by requesting  a direct debit indemnity, it had been made sufficiently clear by the call 
handler that he should only claim  an indemnity  in respect of the fine he wanted to appeal.
Mr K didnt agree. He felt that the view didnt deal with all of the points  he raised, including 
the payment of fines to private parking  companies, who he felt were  unfairly profiting  from 
companies such as LeasePlan who always pay the fine. Mr K said it was impossible to 
challenge a parking fine which had already  been  paid. Mr K also said he thought  the £40 
administration fee charged by LeasePlan  was unreasonable for the work involved. He said 
that even thought hed successful challenged one of the fines, LeasePlan refused to credit 
the £40 fee back to his account. Mr K felt that it was wrong that LeasePlan should be able to

the fine.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the terms and conditions of the agreement. At section 2.2 it says that 
customers must pay all fixed penalty charges, fines, congestion charges or any other 
penalties. It also says that if LeasePlan pay or transfer liability to the customer  for any of 
these sums,  any sums paid will be repaid on demand together with an administration fee. At 
section 1.4 the terms and conditions say that LeasePlan will arrange a road fund licence and 
charge it to the customer and that customers are responsible for paying any increase in the 
charge.
The fines  in Mr Ks case relate to a penalty  charge notice, a congestion charge and a 
parking fine. Theres  also a charge  for an increase in road fund licence. Im satisfied that the 
clauses Ive mentioned  above cover all of these types of charges. So I cant  say that 
Leaseplan has made an error in invoicing Mr K for these charges when it paid them on his 
behalf. Nor can I say that the administration  charge  wasnt chargeable in accordance with 
the terms and conditions.
In the case of the parking  fine, LeasePlan has said that it received notification  of the fine on 
7 December 2017. It says it didnt pay it immediately  but instead gave the parking company 
Mr Ks details  so that the fine could be issued directly to him. I cant  say whether Mr K 
received the fine directly  from the parking company. On 8 January 2018  LeasePlan received 
a second notification from the parking company. At this point LeasePlan paid the charge and 
re-charged Mr Ks account  in line with the terms and conditions  of the agreement.
Its not clear from the information provided  whether Mr K received the parking fine directly 
and/or whether he took any steps  to challenge it at that point. But Im satisfied that the 
actions of LeasePlan in transferring liability gave Mr K the opportunity  to challenge  the fine if 
he wished.
I understand why Mr K feels  that hes been denied the opportunity to challenge the parking 
fine. Hes explained  that the parking company  arent interested in dealing with an appeal  
where a fine has already  been paid. I dont  disagree  with the point  which Mr K makes. 
However, as Ive said above, I think LeasePlan took reasonable  steps to give Mr K the 
chance to challenge the parking fine. And as Mr K has shown, he did manage  to 
successfully challenge  the congestion charge  even  though LeasePlan had paid this on his 
behalf. So I cant say that Mr K was prevented from challenging the fines  but I accept that 
it may have  been  more  difficult in these circumstances.
Ive listened to some of the calls made  by Mr K to LeasePlan. During one of the calls,  Mr K 
had a discussion with the call handler about the direct debit indemnity. Mr K told the call 
handler that his account had fallen into arrears  because  of the payment made by LeasePlan 
in respect of the congestion charge and a parking fine totalling £185. Mr K made it clear 
during the call that he wanted to appeal these  fines. In response,  the call handler advised Mr 
K about the direct debit indemnity, and that a consequence of making such  a claim would be 
that LeasePlans invoice would be put on hold.
Ref: DRN27130273I can see that following  this, Mr K submitted an indemnity claim for all of the fines, as well as 
the road fund licence  charge. LeasePlan has said that because no dispute was raised  by Mr 
K in relation  to those fines,  the invoices were  taken off hold and became payable, which 
ultimately resulted  in arrears on the account.
Taking everything into account,  and whilst I understand  Mr Ks had good  intentions in 
submitting the indemnity claim, I dont think I can say that LeasePlan acted unreasonably 
here. Having  listened  to the calls, Im satisfied that LeasePlan gave Mr K adequate  advice  
about the effects of making an indemnity claim.
I understand Mr Ks strength of feeling  about  this, and in particular about  the £40 charge. I 
understand why he feels  its unfair that he should  be charged when the fine was successfully 
appealed. However, the terms and conditions make  it clear  that LeasePlan can charge an 
administration fee in circumstances where they pay a fine on a customers  behalf. Theres 
nothing in the agreement that says the administration charge will be returned if the fine is 
successfully challenged. From LeasePlans perspective,  it will have incurred administration  
costs in paying the fine, whether or not the fine is ultimately upheld  on appeal.
For the reasons  Ive given Im unable to uphold Mr Ks complaint.
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 December  2019.
