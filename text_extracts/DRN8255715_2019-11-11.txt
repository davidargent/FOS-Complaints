K822xcomplaint
Mr A complains that a car which he bought on finance provided  by Black Horse  Limited  has 
broken down again, following a final decision by the Financial Ombudsman Service  that it 
must be repaired.
background 
In January 2016 Mr A bought a car under  a hire purchase agreement financed  by Black 
Horse. In 2017 he complained about  various problems with the car, which included engine  
failure. Black Horse agreed that the problems were caused by a manufacturing fault, and 
offered to repair the car at no cost to Mr A, and to pay him some  refunds (with interest) and 
compensation. Mr A complained to our Service, as he wanted  to reject the car instead.  On 
21 December 2017 one of our ombudsmen,  Ms Daniela Cirignano, issued a final decision 
upholding that complaint.  She increased  the amount of compensation to be paid to Mr A to 
£500, but she thought  that under the Consumer Rights Act 2015  Black Horse was entitled to 
try to repair the car before  Mr A would be entitled to reject it.
Mr A accepted that decision on 2 January 2018,  and it thereby became legally binding  on 
both parties. But in a letter dated  7 February 2018, Black Horse  told Mr A that the repair 
would not be economical, as it would require replacing the engine and this would exceed 
50% of the cost of the car. So instead  Black Horse said it would allow Mr A to reject the car 
after all. It would unwind the credit agreement, remove all adverse information  from his credit 
file, and pay him compensation and refunds totalling £1,852.86. It also offered to pay him 
travel expenses and loss of earnings  if he provided  evidence of them.
Mr A did not accept that. He insisted that the car should be repaired,  as required by the 
ombudsmans decision, and so Black Horse  agreed to arrange the repair after all. Mr A 
provided evidence  of his expenses, and in August 2018 Black Horse agreed  to pay most  of 
them. However, the repairs were not carried out, and so Mr A raised a second complaint with 
our Service.  That second complaint  is the one I am dealing with here. An independent  
inspection of the car was eventually arranged in July 2019, and it was found that the car 
would not start.
The same investigator who had worked on the original complaint investigated this complaint, 
and in August  2019 she recommended that Mr A be allowed to reject  the car. She said the 
agreement should  be unwound, some of his expenses should  be refunded, and another 
£300 of compensation should be paid, in addition to what the ombudsman had awarded in 
2017.
Black Horse  accepted that decision.  Mr A did not. He asked for £3,000  for his 
inconvenience. He also asked for more  refunds than the ombudsman  and the investigator  
had awarded. So this complaint has been referred  to me for an ombudsmans  decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given what has happened since the original complaint was closed, I think that rejecting the 
car instead of attempting to repair it is now the best thing to do. It follows that the finance 
Ref: DRN82557152agreement should  be unwound and removed from Mr As credit file, and that the deposit 
(£200) should  be refunded.
Since Mr A was without  the car for such a long time,  I agree with the investigator that it 
would be fair to require  Black Horse not to pursue him for the arrears under the agreement.
Black Horse  must also refund the costs of recovering and storing the car, and the cost of the 
diagnostics.
All the payments Mr A has made since April 2017 must be refunded  to him (if they havent  
been already).
I dont think it would  be fair or reasonable to ask Black Horse  to pay Mr A for his fines  or 
charges for traffic offences  or parking offences. But the rest of Mr As travel expenses   that 
is, the cost of renting a replacement car and, during the times that he was without a car, the 
cost of his taxi and bus journeys  must be refunded (to the extent  that he has provided 
evidence for them), minus  the amount of the monthly payments he made, or was supposed 
to make,  under the hire purchase  agreement  during  the time he was without  the car. That is 
the difference between what he would have paid to Black Horse and how much he spent  on 
travel.
In this category  of refunds,  Black Horse agreed in August 2018 to pay Mr A his expenses 
incurred up to the end of July 2018,  less his payments since April 2017. This was calculated 
as £4,466.33 for his car rental agreements, plus £300.30 for taxi and bus journeys, minus 
£550.56 in payments already made since April 2017, for a total of £4,216.07, plus interest on 
that sum at eight  per cent a year. I have checked  Black Horses figures, and they are off by 
£10.16. The rental  agreements actually  add up to £4,466.49, and one refund of £10 for 23 
December 2017  was missed out, so the total for taxis and buses should be £310.30.  So the 
total for travel expenses  up to 31 July 2018  should actually be £4,226.23.
I have looked  at the evidence Mr A has sent us about his expenses since  that date. He has 
provided invoices  from car rental companies  adding up to another  £4,717.27 since  1 August 
2018. He has provided receipts for public  transport journeys which (after excluding duplicate  
copies and journeys he made while he had a rental car) add up to £800.65.
The total of all of these transport costs (minus payments since April 2017) is £9,744.15.
The investigator thought that Black Horse should refund any insurance and car tax payments 
Mr A had made since December 2018 (when he raised this complaint with Black Horse),  
provided that he sent us evidence of them. I have seen evidence that a car insurance  policy  
was cancelled in September  2019, with an outstanding balance of £113.24,  but I have seen 
no evidence about  how much Mr A paid for insurance before then (and since December 
2018). I have seen  a direct debit mandate for tax payments  from March  2017 to February 
2018, but not for any tax since  then.  So I will award only £113.24 in this category.
I will award simple  interest on all the refunds at eight per cent a year,  from the dates these 
costs were incurred to the date of my decision  (see the top of page 1 for the date).
Between the first ombudsmans award of £500 for Mr As inconvenience, and the additional  
£300 recommended  by the investigator for what has happened  since  then, Mr A will have 
had a total of £800. I think that is fair, and in line with what our Service  would  typically  award, 
so I will not increase it.
Ref: DRN82557153my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Black Horse  Limited  to:
Allow Mr A to reject the car.
Unwind the hire purchase agreement and remove it from his credit  file.
Not pursue Mr A for his arrears  under the agreement.
Refund the deposit of £200 and pay simple  interest on this refund at eight per cent a 
year from 22 January 2016 to the date of this decision.
Refund any payments  Mr A has made  since April 2017, unless these have  been  
refunded already,  and pay interest on any refunds not already paid at eight per cent a 
year from when  Mr A made the payments until the date of this decision.
Refund £9,744.15 of Mr As transport costs, with simple  interest  on the refunds  at 
eight per cent a year from the dates these  costs were incurred to the date of this 
decision.
Refund one insurance payment of £113.24,  with simple interest at eight per cent a 
year from 10 September 2019  to the date of this decision.  (A complete list of these 
expenses up to the end of July 2018 is already in Black  Horses possession: see its 
emails to Mr A dated 9 and 10 August 2018. I will provide  the parties with a complete 
list of allowable  travel  expenses paid by Mr A since 1 August  2018.)
Refund Mr A the cost of recovering the car, of the diagnostics, and of storing the car 
since April 2017,  and pay simple interest  on these refunds at eight per cent a year 
from the date or dates  these  costs were charged  to the date of this decision.
Pay Mr A £800 for his inconvenience.
Black  Horse Limited must pay the compensation within  28 days of the date on which  
we tell it that Mr A has accepted my final decision. If it pays later than this, then it 
must also pay simple interest  on the total compensation at eight  percent  a year from 
the date of this decision  to the date of payment.
For clarity,  and to avoid  double recovery,  this decision  (if Mr A accepts it) will replace the 
final decision  in the original complaint, issued by Daniela Cirignano on 21 December 2017.
If Black Horse  considers  that it is required by HM Revenue & Customs  to withhold income 
tax from the interest,  it should tell Mr A how much it has taken  off. It should also give Mr A a 
tax deduction  certificate  if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HMRC if 
appropriate. Mr A should refer to Black Horse if he is unsure of the approach it has taken, 
and both parties should contact HMRC if they want to know  more about the tax treatment of 
this portion of the compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 December  2019.
