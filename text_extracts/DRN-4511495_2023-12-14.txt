The complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain about the interest rate Firstplus Financial Group plc charged them 
on their secured loan. They say the rate was unfairly high.
What happened
Mr and Mrs M took out a second charge mortgage, or secured loan, with Firstplus in 2006. 
They borrowed £30,000, plus a payment protection plan loan, over a term of 20 years, on a 
variable interest rate.
The loan was transferred to Elderbridge several years ago, and Elderbridge remains the 
lender. On 27 August 2021, Mr and Mrs M complained to Elderbridge about the interest rate 
on the loan. They said they felt they had been unfairly overcharged interest over the life of 
the loan.
Elderbridge referred the complaint to Firstplus. In February 2022, Firstplus issued its final 
response to Mr and Mrs Ms complaint. It said Mr and Mrs M had left it too late to complain 
about interest applied more than six years before they made their complaint, but it would 
offer some compensation in respect of the six-year period leading up to the complaint.
Firstplus offered to reduce Mr and Mrs Ms loan balance by £2,539 and pay an additional 
£150 for inconvenience  although it said it didnt accept there had been any unfairness in 
the interest rates applied and this was a goodwill offer. 
In March 2022, Mr and Mrs M referred their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. 
They told us they didnt accept Firstpluss offer. They thought they should receive 
substantially more compensation, as well as 8% annual interest on the refund. They also 
said theyre in severe financial difficulty.
Our Investigator said Mr and Mrs M had complained too late about the interest they had 
been charged before 27 August 2015  that is, more than six years before they complained 
 although he said he would take account of earlier rate changes as part of the wider 
circumstances of the complaint. The Investigator went on to consider whether Firstplus had 
made a reasonable offer of compensation, and concluded that it had.
Mr and Mrs M didnt accept that. They didnt think they were too late to complain and said 
they had had no idea they had been overcharged interest on this loan until they came across 
a group on social media. They didnt think the rate change letters sent to them over the 
years were enough to tell them the interest rate wasnt as low as it should have been, and 
they still wanted 8% interest on Firstpluss refund offer. They also pointed to the health 
problems they and their family have had since 2010 and the stress this has caused them. 
They asked for an Ombudsman to make a decision.
I issued a decision setting out the parts of this complaint the Financial Ombudsman Service 
can and cant consider. I concluded that Mr and Mrs M had complained too late about the 
interest rate that was charged on their loan in the early years, and that we can only look into 
the rate applied since 27 August 2015, which is six years before they made this complaint.
I also said that in considering the interest rate for that period, we would take into account all 
the circumstances of this case  which include the fairness of the rate applied before 
27 August 2015, insofar as this influenced the rate applied after that date.
Following my decision about our jurisdiction in this case, our Investigator made some further 
enquiries of Firstplus about the offer of compensation it had made to Mr and Mrs M. The 
further information received didnt lead the Investigator to change his view about how this 
complaint should fairly be resolved, and Mr and Mrs M had been clear that they didnt accept 
Firstpluss offer. 
The complaint was therefore referred back to me to determine the outcome of the parts of it 
that I can consider. 
My provisional decision
I reached the same overall outcome as our Investigator, and in order to set out my findings 
in more detail I issued a provisional decision. I concluded that Firstpluss offer of 
compensation was fair, and I said:
Mr and Mrs M say that the interest rate on their loan has always been unfairly high and 
has only ever increased, even though base rates were very low between 2008 and when 
they made this complaint in 2021. They consider they have been overcharged and are 
due a refund.
In response to Mr and Mrs Ms complaint, Firstplus said that the interest rate on their loan 
was variable and wasnt tied to an external index such as Bank of England base rate 
(BOEBR) or the Finance House Base Rate (FHBR), although such indices may be 
relevant factors in setting the rate. It also said it had made variations to the rate over the 
years against a backdrop of rising costs and increased credit risk, and the rate on Mr and 
Mrs Ms loan has varied both up and down a number of times, always in line with the loan 
terms. 
The loan terms and conditions set out Firstpluss entitlement to vary the interest rate on 
Mr and Mrs Ms loan. They say, at clause 7:
We may from time to time vary our interest rate. We may increase or reduce our 
interest rate to reflect a change which has occurred, or which we reasonably expect to 
occur in interest rates generally or to ensure that our business is carried on prudently, 
efficiently and competitively. The interest rate on your account will not in any twelve 
month period, vary by more than twice the variation in the Finance House Base Rate 
published by the Finance and Leasing Association during the same period. If for any 
reason, the Finance and Leasing Association ceases to publish the Finance House Base 
Rate we may refer the variation in our interest rates to any other Base Rate which in our 
reasonable opinion best matches that rate.
Mr and Mrs M have referred to base rates generally in this complaint. The interest rate on 
Mr and Mrs Ms loan, the FHBR, and BOEBR, have varied as follows:

increase and never fall, so I dont accept Mr and Mrs Ms argument that it never fell. But it 
also shows that the loan interest rate didnt consistently follow movements in FHBR and 
BOEBR  particularly after both FHBR and BOEBR began to fall sharply from late 2008 
onwards. So the loan rate didnt change in line with interest rates generally as clause 7 
of the terms said it may. 
Clause 7 also said the loan interest rate could change to ensure that our business is 
carried on prudently, efficiently and competitively. I think that, however, is very broad, 
and only one of the letters Ive seen that Firstplus sent to Mr and Mrs M notifying them of 
a change in the interest rate (in September 2009) said the rate was changing for this 
reason.
Having considered the loan agreement and the way Mr and Mrs Ms loan interest rate has 
operated over the years, while Im satisfied that clause 7 made it clear that Mr and 
Mrs Ms loan interest rate was variable, Im not satisfied that the reasons the rate could be 
varied were as clear and unambiguous as they could have been, or that the rate was 
consistently varied fairly. I also note that the agreement said Mr and Mrs M would be 
required to pay additional interest, plus a fee, if they settled their loan early. This could 
have resulted in unfairness had Mr and Mrs M been considering repaying early or moving 
their loan to another lender, although I havent seen anything to indicate that they have 
tried to do so.
Firstplus has said it recognises that Mr and Mrs M may not fully have appreciated the way 
the loan was intended to operate when they took it out, although it doesnt accept that it 
has applied interest unfairly. It has made an offer of compensation, and I need to decide 
whether I think that offer represents a fair and reasonable resolution to this complaint. In 
all the circumstances of this complaint, I think it does.
Firstpluss offer to refund £2,539 of interest is based on the interest rate that would have 
applied to Mr and Mrs Ms loan had the rate reflected changes in the FHBR more closely 
since December 2008  when both FHBR and BOEBR began to fall sharply following the 
financial crash  and had the rate reflected changes in the BOEBR since January 2020, 
when the FHBR had stopped being published. Firstplus has also applied a floor  a rate 
below which Mr and Mrs Ms loan rate cant fall  in its calculations.
Firstplus has provided its calculations and the data behind those calculations, all of which 
Ive carefully considered. This information shows that Firstpluss offer of compensation is 
based on an interest rate of 5.019% (the rate floor) having been applied to Mr and 
Mrs Ms loan from 27 August 2015 to 31 December 2021. 
I think the approach Firstplus has applied is a reasonable one, and I dont consider that I 
can fairly require it to increase its offer. I have considered whether striking out the interest 
rate variation term would result in a fairer outcome, but I dont think it would, since doing 
so would mean Mr and Mrs M had a fixed interest rate on their loan, and its clear from 
the loan agreement that thats not what they signed up to and is not what they should 
reasonably have expected.
I think that recalculating the interest rate based on how FHBR and later BOEBR operated 
is appropriate in the light of the specific reference in the loan terms to FHBR and any 
other base rate if FHBR ceased being published. I also consider including an interest rate 
floor in this recalculation is fair, to reflect the riskier nature to lenders of second charge 
lending as opposed to first charge, and to reflect that interest rates on second charge 
borrowing are generally higher as a result. Including a floor ensures that the interest rate 
doesnt become the same as or lower than what wed likely see for first charge lending across the same period. The interest rate floor is dependent on several factors, including 
the initial interest rate on the loan, the average standard variable rate (SVR) for secured 
first charge lending at the time, and the average SVR at the point this complaint was first 
made. It ensures there will always be an appropriate difference between the average SVR 
on first charge mortgages and the interest rate applied to Mr and Mrs Ms loan. 
I must also keep in mind that I can only make any award or direction in respect of a 
limited period, from 27 August 2015. The time limits I have to apply mean I cant direct 
Firstplus to extend compensation further back than that. 
Mr and Mrs M have said that Firstplus should pay them interest at 8% on the 
compensation, and they have seen on online forums that other borrowers have received 
this. The Financial Ombudsman Services approach to compensation includes making 
interest awards where appropriate, and we may in some cases award simple interest at 
an annual rate of 8% where a complainant has been out of pocket as a result of a 
financial businesss mistake.
However, I dont think that applies in Mr and Mrs Ms case. They have been in arrears on 
their loan for a number of years. As a result, in late 2015 Firstplus suspended interest on 
the loan. This means that since late 2015 the loan interest has accrued in a separate 
account, so that all of Mr and Mrs Ms payments went towards the capital balance rather 
than the interest, and additional interest wasnt added to the interest charges. It also 
means that Mr and Mrs M havent been paying the interest on the loan since 2015  and 
so they arent out of pocket as a result of the level of the interest rate that has been 
applied to this loan. 
In the period I can consider, therefore, since 27 August 2015, Mr and Mrs M havent 
actually paid any more interest than they would have done had their loan been subject to 
a lower interest rate, and they havent been out of pocket as a result of the payments 
theyve made. The loan interest will become payable once the capital balance has been 
repaid, and that hasnt happened during the period Ive considered in this complaint. It 
follows that I dont consider Firstplus should add interest to its offer in this case, and that I 
find crediting the £2,539 to the loan rather than paying it to Mr and Mrs M direct is fair and 
reasonable.
Finally, if Mr and Mrs M are unhappy with the interest rate on their loan since the date to 
which Firstplus has calculated its offer of compensation (which is 31 December 2021) or 
in future, they may take that up with the current lender in the first instance. Firstplus has 
said that they can contact their current lender if they want to look into moving the loan 
elsewhere, and it would see whether it could help  and it would also cover any early 
settlement charges on the loan.
I invited Mr and Mrs M and Firstplus to let me have any more evidence or arguments they 
wanted me to consider before I make my final decision.
Mr and Mrs M asked for an extra month to respond, because they had found some 
correspondence from around 2015/2016 that Firstplus had sent them after they made some 
enquiries about the loan balance. They wanted to look to see if they had any further 
documents. They also said an average borrower wouldnt necessarily understand how base 
rate changes might affect the interest rate on a loan, and they had expected Firstplus to treat 
them fairly.
Firstplus said it didnt agree with everything I had said in my provisional decision, but it had 
nothing more to add and it was still prepared to settle this complaint in line with the offer of 
compensation it had made and which I had provisionally found to be fair.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, while I realise Mr and Mrs M will be disappointed, Ive come to the same 
conclusion as I did in my provisional decision.
Mr and Mrs M want more time to look for documents which they think may be relevant to 
their complaint. Ive considered what theyve said but, as I said when I set out the scope of 
the Financial Ombudsman Services power to consider this complaint, I found no record of 
Mr and Mrs M having made a complaint about the fairness of the interest rate on their loan 
any earlier than 27 August 2021. Mr and Mrs M have said they dont remember making a 
complaint in around 2015/2016. Any questions they may have asked Firstplus about the rate 
or any discussions they had about it in 2015/2016 wouldnt extend the time period I can 
consider and make an award for  because theres nothing to indicate, either in Firstpluss 
records or from what Mr and Mrs M have said, that they made a complaint at that time. 
I also explained when I issued my decision about the Financial Ombudsman Services 
jurisdiction in this case why I considered that Mr and Mrs M ought reasonably to have 
realised that they had cause for complaint more than three years before they complained in 
2021. I still consider that they had enough information available to them reasonably to have 
known what interest rate they were being charged, and that they could have complained 
sooner had they wished to do so.  
For these reasons, and given that Firstplus hasnt made any further points for me to 
consider, I confirm my provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that Firstplus Financial Group plc has made a fair offer of compensation. 
To settle this complaint, it should reduce Mr and Mrs Ms loan balance by £2,539, pay Mr 
and Mrs M £150 for their inconvenience, and pay any early settlement charge Elderbridge 
may apply should Mr and Mrs M move their loan elsewhere within six months of my final 
decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
