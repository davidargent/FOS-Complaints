K820x#14complaint
Mrs A says HFC Bank Limited (HFC) mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
background
This complaint is about a credit  card PPI policy taken out in 1994.  The policy was added  to 
Mrs As credit  card account  when she applied for the card by post.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.  Mrs A disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mrs As case. 
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs As complaint because:
 I think HFC made Mrs A aware  that the PPI was optional and that she chose to take it 
 although I can understand  why she can no longer  remember  this. The type of form 
she most likely  completed has yes and no boxes for PPI. Its very unlikely the PPI 
would have been added to her account  if Mrs A hadnt ticked the yes box.
 HFC didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs A so it didnt have to check  if it was suitable  for 
her. 
 Its possible the information HFC gave Mrs A about the PPI wasnt as clear as it should  
have been. But Mrs A chose to take out the policy  and so appears to have wanted this 
type of cover. She was not affected  by any of the exclusions  or limitations and the 
policy was competitively priced  and apparently affordable. So I think  it unlikely Mrs A 
would have made a different decision if better information had been provided. On 
balance I think she would  still have  taken out the policy.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs A to let me 
know whether she accepts or rejects my decision before  1 December 2019.
