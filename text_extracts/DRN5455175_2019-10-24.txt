* Maximum  monthly  instalment over the term of the loan
Mr B says that if Myjar had carried out better checks, it would have realised the loans were 
unaffordable. He says that the loans made his financial  situation worse and caused him to 
get into a debt spiral.  Mr B says he had to enter into a debt management plan as a result.
Myjar says it asked  Mr B about  income and expenditure and checked his credit  file. It says it 
carried out appropriate affordability  checks and its lending decisions were based  on the 
available information.  But it offered  to close loan 12 and mark it as settled on his credit file.
Mr B did not accept this offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He found that if Myjar had 
carried out proportionate checks, its likely  it would  have become aware that Mr B had a 
number of other outstanding short-term loans by the time he applied  for loan 4. He also said 
that Mr Bs borrowing pattern itself suggested the loans had become unsustainable  by loan 
7. He recommended Myjar  should  refund interest  and charges on loans 4 to 12 (plus 8% 
statutory interest).  He also said negative information about loans 4 to 6 should be removed 
from Mr Bs credit  file and that loans 7 to 12 should  be removed from his credit  file entirely. 
Myjar responded to say, in summary,  that there was insufficient detail in the adjudicators 
view and it was unclear what evidence was used  to reach the conclusion.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN54551752Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers credit record as well as their income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors should 
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Myjar was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Loans 1 to 3
For these loans, the scheduled  repayments  were a relatively small proportion of Mr Bs 
declared income. I can see Myjar also asked Mr B about his expenditure and checked his 
credit file. Given the circumstances of Mr Bs early loans, I consider Myjar carried  out 
proportionate checks at this stage and there  was nothing  to indicate the repayments were  
unaffordable to him.
Ref: DRN54551753Loans 4 to 6
As our adjudicator explained, by the time Mr B applied for loan 4, a proportionate check  
should have included asking him whether  he had any other  short-term  loans. For loans 5 
and 6 I consider  a full financial review should  have been carried  out. Its likely such checks 
would have shown  Mr B:
had multiple short-term loans with other  providers  four or five outstanding at the 
time of each of loans  4 to 6;
spent a significant amount of money  on gambling;
had an active debt management plan.
So Im satisfied that proportionate checks would have indicated  that Mr B was struggling to 
manage his money  and shouldnt have been approved  for further  lending  from loan 4.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Myjar should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Myjar  should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
By loan 7 Mr B had been borrowing monthly from Myjar for over six months  and the 
amounts requested were not decreasing;
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr B was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks  of 
settling a previous  one. So Myjar ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mr B was having  to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Myjar. Loan 12 was 
taken out 12 months after Mr Bs first. And it was for six times the amount. Mr B had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Myjar over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Myjar continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 12 and Myjar should  put things right.
Ref: DRN54551754my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR  Limited should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr B paid on loans 4 to 12;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 12, apply  the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr B;
Remove any negative  information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file;
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 12 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Myjar intends  to 
apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital  balance, it must do so after deducting  the 
tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 November  2019.
