K821x#15complaint
Mr S says Advanced Payment Solutions Limited  (APS) trading as Cashplus lent to him 
irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on this complaint  on 19 September 2019  a copy 
is attached and it forms part of this final decision.  I explained why I intended to uphold Mr S 
complaint in part and asked Mr S and Cashplus to let me know if they had anything to add.
The deadline  for responses has now passed and neither Mr S nor Cashplus have sent me 
anything else to consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint,  taking into account this services general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending as set out on our website.
As neither party has sent me anything else to consider, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings. My final decision is therefore the same as my provisional  decision, for 
the same  reasons.
putting things right
APS must:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid for loan 10 and all subsequent loans
pay interest of 8% simple  per year on the refunded interest  and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement**;
the number  of loans taken from loan 10 means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  these loans should be removed from Mr S credit file
**HM Revenue & Customs requires  APS to take off tax from this interest.  APS must  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN68229672my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr S complaint in part. 
Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited  must put things right by taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 November 2019.

complaint
Mr S says Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited (APS) trading as Cashplus  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr S had a number of loans  with APS between November 2010 and February 2015.  Ive set out some 
of the information APS provided about the loans  in an appendix to this decision.
Our adjudicator considered  Mr S complaint and recommended it be upheld in its entirety. He didnt 
think APS should have  approved any of the loans. He noted that from the outset Mr S appeared  to be 
struggling with existing debts, including priority debts such  as his mortgage.  In addition, he thought  
the number of loans and length of time APS continuously lent to Mr S demonstrated  that the lending 
wasnt sustainable.
APS rejected the adjudicators view  although  it gave  no reasons for doing  so. As no agreement was 
reached, the complaint  was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr S case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr S complaint in part and have explained why below.
APS needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice  this means  
that it should  have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S could repay  his loans in a 
sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr S income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr S complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did APS, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate  checks to satisfy  itself that 
Mr S would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have shown 
that Mr S would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr S indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
3.Did APS act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ref: DRN68229674Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr S complaint.
Did APS each  time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that Mr S 
would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks  have  shown that Mr S would 
have been able to do so?
APS hasnt provided any detailed evidence of how it assessed how much (or whether) Mr S could 
afford to borrow. Ive noted APS says it carried out rigorous system-based analysis which  included 
carrying out credit checks but it hasnt shown us the details of this analysis or the credit checks for 
any of the loans. This means Im unable  to conclude APS carried  out proportionate checks for any of 
the loans it approved for Mr S.
Our adjudicator took into account  information  from a credit history provided  by Mr S. He thought  that 
as APS carried out credit  checks, it wouldve been aware of the same adverse  information as 
appeared on the credit  history provided by Mr S. The adverse information  included that Mr S was in 
two to three months of mortgage arrears, had similar arrears on a connected  unsecured loan and was 
behind on a number  of credit  card payments.  Based  on this information, our adjudicator thought it 
wasnt reasonable  for APS to decide to lend.
I share our adjudicators  concerns about how Mr S was manging his money before APS first lent to 
him. But given the size of the first loan (£50) and Mr S income (£45,000-£50,000 a year) I dont think  
it would necessarily  have been fair for APS to automatically reject Mr S application on the basis of a 
credit report alone. Clearly arrears on priority  debts in particular shouldve been of concern  to a 
responsible lender. 
However, I think it wouldve been proportionate for APS to have taken  steps to understand Mr S 
financial circumstances (as they were at the time) including obtaining information  about  his monthly  
financial commitments, how he was managing  his arrears and the arrangements he had with his 
creditors. It would then have been able to make a better-informed decision about  whether  or not to 
lend to him.
As APS didnt do this, Id usually consider what such checks would  likely have shown. But theres 
limited information about Mr S circumstances available from this time. I havent seen bank statements  
or other  clear information about his income and outgoings from as far back as November 2010. So I 
cant make  a finding on whether some  of Mr S earlier  loans were  actually sustainably  affordable or 
not. In the circumstances, looking at the earlier  period  of lending, I cant say that APS did something 
wrong when lending  to Mr S.
I havent attempted to recreate individual,  proportionate affordability checks  from 
23 February 2012 (loan 10) onwards because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why 
this is the case in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mr S indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
In looking at the pattern of lending Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  APS should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so APS 
shouldve realised  that it shouldnt  have provided  any further lending.  
Given the particular circumstances of Mr S case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 10. I say 
this because by then there had been an unbroken  period of lending of about  eight months with 
generally only short  gaps  between the loans.  The amount Mr S was borrowing was increasing  over 
time, with Mr S borrowing twice in February 2012. Given this and Mr S apparent need to borrow 
almost every month,  APS ought to have realised it was likely Mr S indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Ref: DRN68229675That Mr S wasnt able to free himself of the need continuously to borrow also meant he wasnt making 
any real inroads to the amount he owed APS  which broadly increased over time. And he was in 
effect paying  large amounts  of interest to service a debt to APS over an extended period
I think  that Mr S lost out because  APS continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 onwards. I think 
these loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr S indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive 
credit over an extended  period of time. In addition, the sheer number of loans was likely to have had 
negative implications  on Mr S ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans
There was a clearly unbroken period of lending  from June  2011 until September  2014  a period of 
well over three years. Ive noted there  was a longer break between the penultimate and final loan of 
about four months. In Mr S circumstances, I dont think that four months is long enough to break  the 
chain of lending  which went  before it. Four months isnt in my view significant  when considering  it 
followed an almost 40 month-long  lending  relationship and I dont think that it was long enough that 
APS could reasonably  conclude Mr S finances were likely to have improved  during this time.
So Im planning to uphold Mr S complaint  about the loans from loan 10 onwards because  the overall 
pattern of lending increased Mr S indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful 
and he lost out as a result.
Did APS act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude APS acted unfairly or unreasonably  towards  Mr S in some other way.  
putting things  right  proposal for what APS needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr S paid for loan 10 and all subsequent  loans
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 10 means any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries about these loans should be removed from Mr S credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  APS to take off tax from this interest. APS must  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold Mr S complaint in part and to tell Advanced Payment Solutions Limited to put things 
right by taking  the steps set out above.
