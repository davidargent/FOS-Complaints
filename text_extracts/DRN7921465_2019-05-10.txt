K821x#15complaint
Mr A says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 29 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr A. Ive set out details of 
some of the loans in an appendix at the end of this decision.
When Mr A complained to QuickQuid,  it didnt fully uphold his complaint but offered to pay 
redress on loans 9, 10 and 12. QuickQuid said a pattern of dependency had emerged by 
loan 9 and this pattern continued.  QuickQuid also said that Mr A had complained  about  
loans 1 to 8 too late and objected to this service  looking  into his complaint about those loans. 
Mr A has withdrawn  his complaint about loans 1 to 8. Although  Im not making a decision 
about loans 1 to 8, Ive included those loans at the end of my decision as they form part of 
Mr As borrowing  history  with QuickQuid.
Our adjudicator considered loans 9 and the subsequent  loans and upheld  Mr As complaint.  
Our adjudicator thought loan 9 onwards  shouldnt  have been lent as Mr A continued 
dependence on these loans continued and the borrowing  wasnt  sustainable. QuickQuid 
disagreed and the complaint was passed to me  an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN79214652There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The Office of Fair Tradings Irresponsible  Lending  
Guidance refers to sustainability in much the same way as CONC. And it follows  that a 
lender should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont  be 
able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make  their 
repayments without  borrowing  further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for As complaint.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
loans 9 to 27
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that the point QuickQuid ought to 
have reasonably seen that further lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful was 
reached by loan 9, something QuickQuid itself acknowledges. I agree  that Mr A was 
dependent on the loan from this point but I dont agree that the dependency stopped after 
loan 12. I say this because:
From  loan 9 to 27 Mr A was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks of settling a 
previous one. In many  instances, he borrowed a new loan on the same day he repaid 
a previous loan.  So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mr A was having  to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  Loan  27 was 
taken out almost three years  after Mr As first. And it was for a larger  amount - more  
than three times his first loan. Mr A had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, 
service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN79214653loan 28 and 29
I can see there was a gap between when Mr A repaid loan 27 and when he borrowed loan 
28. I can also see that although there were no loans  approved during this time, from the 
credit checks QuickQuid  has provided,  Mr A was applying for loans during that period  up 
until August 2013.  Effectively in the time Mr A was applying for loans,  QuickQuid couldnt  
reasonably believe  that his financial circumstances  had improved.  So I agree with the 
adjudicator that there was a break of over a year between loans 27 and 28. The maximum 
repayment for loan 28 was around  £795  and Mr A has to make  2 smaller repayments of 
£187.10 and £161.20 for this loan. 
In its file submission to this service,  although  it isnt clear from the table provided, QuickQuid 
seems to suggest that it worked out Mr As estimated disposable income for this loan as 
£374. And in an email  in response to our adjudication  it says it worked  out Mr As disposable 
income as £1,577 for the term of loan 28. QuickQuid hasnt told this service  how it arrived at 
these figures and the accuracy of either figure is unclear from the information  QuickQuid has 
provided. QuickQuid is suggesting here that Mr A had the opportunity  to save in the first two 
months before the final repayment  was due.
But given Mr As history with QuickQuid, I cant see why QuickQuid may have thought hed 
be able to save during the period to put him in a position  to afford the large final repayment 
of around £795.  I think that given the fact that the final balloon repayment  represented such  
a large part of Mr As declared income of £1,300, its more likely that he wouldve struggled 
to sustainably repay this loan. This was borne out by the fact that Mr A ran into difficulties 
repaying this loan and had to enter  into a repayment  plan. So it wasnt reasonable for 
QuickQuid to have  lent Mr A this loan.
After Mr A raised  a complaint about  his loans and within days  of repaying loan 28  which he 
needed a payment plan to repay, QuickQuid approved loan 29. The circumstances around 
this loan make it unfair that Mr A was given further lending. Mr A was obviously in financial 
difficulties that QuickQuid was aware  of and hed expressed dissatisfaction about  the loans, 
it wasnt responsible  to continue lending in those circumstances.
In response to our adjudication, QuickQuid argued  that it wasnt  possible to determine 
sustainability without  looking  at the affordability  of each loan. Also,  in its business file, 
QuickQuid attached a document called  CEU  Lending process which  it says shows that the 
loans it lent Mr A after March 2015  were  responsibly lent.
This service has responded in recent final decisions to QuickQuids argument about its 
lending process  post 2015 and so I wont be commenting further  on those submissions again 
here although Ive considered them. And this is why in this decision, Ive focussed on the 
specifics of Mr As complaint.
Also, QuickQuid will know from previous  decisions that there  are cases  where this service  
considers the overall lending pattern and not just the affordability of each loan. When  a 
consumer borrows numerous  loans over a long period of time, its most likely that the loans 
arent being used  for their intended purpose  of temporary cash  flow problems. QuickQuid 
itself acknowledges  that its loans arent suitable for long term use, which  is what  has 
happened here.
Ref: DRN79214654Mr A has lost as QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr As 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 9 to 29 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what  QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loan 9 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  9 to 29 should be removed  from Mr As 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr A a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr As complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC should 
pay Mr A compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
