The complaint
Miss G is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dealt with a dispute she raised 
under PayPal buyer protection.
What happened
Miss G has explained that in May 2021 she purchased a buttonhole machine. She bought 
the item online, and paid for this through PayPal, in two transactions. One transaction for 
£300, and one for £700. Miss G paid £94 to have the machine delivered to her. But this 
wasnt paid for using PayPal. 
Miss G received the buttonhole machine but said that the item didnt work properly from the 
point she took delivery. She said she was in contact with the seller regularly about this. And 
when she still experienced problems, she paid for an independent engineer to look at the 
item  for the cost of £100. Miss G has said the engineer told her she had purchased a faulty 
machine, and that the machine contained parts not authorised by the manufacturer.
Because of the above, Miss G raised a dispute through PayPal, saying the item wasnt as 
described. This dispute wasnt upheld  with the reason given being that Miss G had altered 
or repaired the item whilst in her possession. 
Miss G then raised a second dispute  and has said she was told to return the buttonhole 
machine to seller, to then receive a refund. Miss G said she did return the item. However, 
PayPal said the proof that Miss G provided to show she returned the item wasnt valid. So, it 
didnt uphold this dispute either.
Miss G has said the proof she provided was valid. And shes highlighted that she has now 
been left both without the machine, and without the £1,000 she paid for it. And she incurred 
£112 in costs for returning the machine via a courier. In addition to costs for an independent 
engineer.  
Because Miss G remained dissatisfied, she referred her complaint to this service for an 
independent review.
Our investigator considered this complaint and thought it should be upheld. They said Miss 
G had raised her dispute with PayPal within the 180 days required of her. And that shes 
provided sufficient proof to show she had returned the item. So, they recommended PayPal 
pay Miss G £1,000. 
Miss G responded and accepted this. PayPal responded, and said it didnt agree. It asked 
for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
Because of this, this complaint has been referred to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ive explained why below.
Ive reviewed the terms and conditions of PayPals Buyer Protection. I can see this says:
When buying something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund 
under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection entitles you to 
reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost you paid, 
if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for PayPal 
Buyer Protection, PayPals original determination is considered final, but you may be able to 
file an appeal of the decision if you have new or compelling information not available at the 
time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making 
process.
So, Im aware if eligible, there are situations in which Miss G may be able to receive a refund 
for the purchase price of the item she bought. 
Ive also read the eligibility criteria noted in the terms. And Miss G meets these for the 
buttonhole machine. 
Miss G raised a first dispute, which was unsuccessful. But she raised a second. Ive seen 
the outcome of this second dispute. And this said the dispute was found in the sellers 
behaviour, because the proof of return Miss G had provided was invalid. 
Miss G feels the outcome reached for this dispute is incorrect  so there was an error in the 
decision-making process. She says this was the case as she did have valid proof of 
returning the machine to the seller. 
As Miss G feels there was an error in the decision-making process, Ive thought about 
whether PayPal acted fairly here. And I dont think it did. I can see from PayPals file it visited 
a couriers website  and tried to put in a tracking number for the return. But this didnt yield 
any results. But the website checked appears to be wrong. Miss G used a courier price 
comparison website, and then purchased the return via that website, but with a different 
company. So, when searching the website PayPal did, it wouldnt have shown the successful 
return.
In any event, Miss G provided other information, to evidence she had returned the item. This 
included videos of her packaging the item for return, the receipt for booking the return with a 
courier, a photo from the courtier which shows the item being signed for at the intended 
destination. And photos of the item in the place of return. I think this evidence is persuasive 
in showing that Miss G returned the item to the seller. And so, I think PayPal has acted 
unfairly in not accepting this evidence as proof of return  and therefore reimbursing her for 
the cost of the buttonhole machine. Given this, Im requiring PayPal to pay Miss G £1,000.
Miss G also mentioned the shipping costs she paid to receive the buttonhole machine, and 
to then send it back to the seller. Ive considered these costs. And Im satisfied PayPal 
doesnt need to do anything in respect of these.
From the information Miss G has provided, the shipping costs she paid to receive the item 
werent paid through PayPal. And so, wouldnt be covered under the buyer protection Miss G 
had  the eligibility criteria explain the payment has to have been made through Miss Gs 
PayPal account. 
In terms of the costs to return the machine, PayPals user agreement explains the following:
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.Given the above is clear that return shipping costs wont be reimbursed by PayPal, Im 
satisfied it hasnt done anything wrong in not refunding these costs to Miss G. 
I also note Miss G paid for an independent engineer to look at the buttonhole machine for 
her, and it established problems with the item. But looking through the PayPal Buyer 
Protection terms, there isnt anything within these which provide for reimbursement of costs 
such as this. So, I dont require PayPal to reimburse Miss G for this either.
My final decision
Given the above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cia SCA to pay Miss G £1,000. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 August 2022.
