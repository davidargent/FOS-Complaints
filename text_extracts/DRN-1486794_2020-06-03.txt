 Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny had been wrong to give loans 1 to 5 and 14 to 16 to Mr F. 
But they didnt think Sunny should have agreed to lend from loan 6 to 13 and from loan 17 
onwards as it was apparent from the pattern of Mr Fs borrowing that he was reliant on the 
short-term loans and was unlikely to sustainably repay the amounts borrowed. 
Sunny agreed with the adjudicators assessment to uphold loan 17 onwards but didnt agree 
that loans 6 to 13 should be upheld. The offer to settle the complaint by upholding loans 17 
to 35 was put to Mr F but he didnt agree. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me to issue a final 
decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr F could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. There was a significant break in Mr Fs borrowing from Sunny. There was a gap of nearly 
two and half years between loans 13 and 15. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view 
these gaps as an indication that Mr Fs finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances were that had caused him to take out the loans. So, I will look at Mr Fs 
borrowing in two separate lending chains. 
The first chain was made up of loans 1 to 13 and the second chain was loans 14 and 35. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more before it lent Mr F loans 1 to 5 and 
loans 14 to 16. Mr F hasnt disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so I wont be making 
any further findings on these loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Sunny agreed with the adjudicators findings to uphold loans 17 to 35 and I agree with the 
adjudicators rationale. So, I dont need to make any further findings on these loans either. 
But Ive kept all of these loans in mind when thinking about the overall borrowing relationship 
between Mr F and Sunny. 
All thats left for me to consider are loans 6 to 13. 
Having carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint, Im partly upholding the complaint. Ill 
explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Fs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr F was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr F had taken out six loans within 11 months and Mr F had been 
indebted to Sunny for all of that time. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mr F was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Fs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Fs first instalment loan was for £500 and although loan six was for £200, the 
amounts Mr F had been borrowing was fluctuating.  By now, Sunny ought to have 
known that it was unlikely Mr F was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 13 was 
taken out 20 months after Mr Fs first. Mr F had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 to loan 
13 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Fs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 13 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans 6 to 13 (and if it hasnt done so 
already to also do this for loans 17 to 35);
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
as agreed previously any adverse information recorded about loans 17 and 18 
should be removed from Mr Fs credit file;
any information recorded about loan 6 to 13 is adverse. So, all entries about these 
loans should be removed from Mr Fs credit file (this also applies to loans 19 onwards 
if this hasnt already happened).
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 July 2020.
