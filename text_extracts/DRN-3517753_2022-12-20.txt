The complaint
Mr H complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) wont refund money he lost to an 
investment scam.
Mr H is being represented by a claims management company in his complaint.
What happened
Mr H was contacted by an individual claiming to be from an online trading brokerage firm J 
after he left his details on a web form. The individual sold him an investment opportunity. 
When exactly this happened is unclear  Mr Hs representative states the scam started 
towards the end of 2019, but Mr H told Barclays that hed made his original investment with J 
in 2017. Regardless, the payments Mr H disputes commenced in December 2019 and so 
Ive proceeded on that basis.
Between December 2019 and January 2021, Mr H made several payments from his 
personal and business accounts with Barclays. This decision only relates to payments Mr H 
made from his personal account  22 payments totalling just over £164,000. The first 12 
payments, around £22,500, went to a cryptocurrency exchange before being transferred to 
Mr Hs trading account with J. The subsequent payments went to an individual  JN  
based in another country, and Mr H thought they were service and legal fees to withdraw his 
profits.

Mr H eventually realised hed been scammed by J, and he reported the matter to Barclays in 
December 2020  around a month before he made the final payment that hes disputed. 
Barclays attempted to recover the money from the beneficiary bank but was unsuccessful. 
Mr H raised a complaint when Barclays refused to refund the money and subsequently 
referred it to our service. 
Our investigator wasnt persuaded that Barclays had acted unfairly or unreasonably in 
relation to this matter. They didnt think the payments were so unusual or uncharacteristic 
that Barclays ought to have intervened. The investigator didnt recommend a refund.
Mr Hs representative disagreed with the investigators findings. The case was escalated to 
me for a decision. I wrote to Mr Hs representative informally and explained that while I 
thought that the payment on 8 September 2020 ought to have flagged on the banks 
systems, I wasnt persuaded that an intervention would have made a difference to Mr Hs 
decision-making. As such, I intended agreeing with the overall outcome reached by the 
investigator. I also had some follow up questions for Mr H, which Ive now received answers 
to. So, its appropriate to progress the case to decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Under regulations, and in accordance with general banking terms and conditions, banks 
should execute an authorised payment instruction without undue delay. The starting position 
is that liability for an authorised payment rests with the payer, even if they were duped into 
doing so, for example as part of an investment scam. 
From the evidence Barclays has provided, all the disputed transactions were international 
payments. What this means is that the Lending Standards Boards Contingent 
Reimbursement Model (the CRM Code), which requires signatories such as Barclays to 
reimburse customers who are victims of scams like this one in all but a limited number of 
circumstances, doesnt apply.
While I find the CRM Code doesnt apply here, it isnt the full extent of the relevant 
obligations that could apply in cases such as this. In accordance with the law, regulations 
and good industry practice, a bank has a duty to protect its customers against the risk of 
fraud and scams so far as is reasonably possible. If, in breach of that duty, a bank fails to act 
on information which ought reasonably to alert a prudent banker to potential fraud or 
financial crime, it might be liable for the losses incurred by its customers as a result. 
Ive considered the operation of Mr Hs account to determine whether the transactions were 
so unusual or uncharacteristic that I think Barclays should have intervened. I dont think the 
first 12 payments  to Coinify and Coini Aps  between December 2019 and July 2020 were 
unusual or out of character for Mr Hs account activity. He regularly made payments for 
similar amounts. Also, Mr Hs bank statements show previous payments to cryptocurrency 
exchange platforms  there are two, albeit smaller, payments to Coinbase in February 2018. 
And looking at an internal system screenshot that Barclays has provided, it also appears that 
in March 2016 he made a payment to a binary options firm. Mr Hs representatives latest 
response suggests that they accept and agree with my finding in relation to these payments. 
So, Ill move on to the remaining payments.The investigators view was that none of the payments appeared unusual. This is where I 
think differently to the investigator. While it is true that previous account activity shows 
instances of payments in the region of £25,000-£30,000, Mr H was transferring funds to his 
own business account with Barclays in those instances. In my view, a bank should view 
transfers between its customers personal and business accounts and external third-party 
payments differently when monitoring accounts for the purposes of fraud detection.
Its arguable whether the payment of £9,900 on 23 July 2020 ought to have flagged as 
unusual, given Mr Hs bank statements show he made a payment for a similar amount in 
January 2020. I appreciate its in dispute whether that payment was successful, but Im more 
persuaded by Barclays explanation, i.e., transactions on any given date arent posted in 
order on the bank statement, and Mr H transferred £8,000 into his account before making a 
third-party bill payment for the same amount on 17 January 2020.
Similarly, I find that the next four payments  all in August 2020  were in line with Mr Hs 
account spending activity. But I consider that the payment of £21,000 on 8 September 2020 
ought to have flagged as unusual and Barclays ought to have looked into it and properly 
questioned Mr H before executing his authorised instruction. And, from what Ive seen, 
I think it more likely than not that Mr H would have explained the true nature of his payment 
had he been asked about it. He hadnt been given a reason to think he had to hide this 
information from his bank. Neither had he been coached to tell them something different. 
Given that Mr Hs explanation would have shown hallmarks of a scam, I would have then 
expected Barclays to have provided him with a warning about investment scams. It doesnt 
appear that the payment in question triggered Barclays systems. So, an opportunity to 
intervene and provide a scam warning was missed. But that isnt the end of the matter.
Causation is a critical determinative factor in every fraud case. It isnt enough that a payment 
service provider failed to act unfairly or unreasonably; its acts or omissions must be the 
immediate and effective cause of losses that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 
breach. While I think that Barclays missed an opportunity to intervene and provide a warning 
to Mr H, this doesnt mean that it automatically becomes responsible for his loss. Id also 
need to be satisfied that the breach would have made a difference to Mr Hs decision-
making.
I thank Mr Hs representative for responding to the additional questions I asked. Ive carefully 
considered their comments in conjunction with other information on file. I cant know for 
certain what would have happened if Barclays had questioned Mr H in September 2020 
before processing the payment in question. In such situations, I reach my conclusions not 
based on mere possibilities but rather on what I find most probable to have happened in the 
circumstances. In other words, I make my decision based on the balance of probabilities  
so what I consider more likely than not to have happened considering the evidence and 
wider circumstances of the case. This includes taking into account Mr Hs state of mind as 
well as actions that were taken by him. 
Having done so, Im not convinced that Mr H would have stopped had there been a suitable 
intervention from Barclays. This is because Mr H had made several payments to the 
scammer by that point and, reading through the chat transcript between him and the 
scammer, he was clearly taken in by the scam. It is evident from the transcript, which shows 
the time of the messages but it isnt dated, that Mr H continued sending money to the 
scammer despite his family telling him hed been scammed. He writes to the scammer in 
December 2020 that, my want me to contact Barclays bank and record thst [sic] i've been 
scammed. Please hurry A couple of days later he writes, dads pressing charges 
Tuesday and taking me to Barclays bank Ive also reviewed the system contact notes that Barclays has provided. It shows that 
Barclays received a call from Mr Hs father on 15 December 2020; the date Mr H sent 
£12,000 to JN. The note states that Mr Hs father called in relation to his accounts and said 
that Mr H (who holds a Power of Attorney for him) had transferred money without his 
permission and had become a victim of an investment scam. The note goes on to say that 
the agent temporarily restricted Mr Hs access to his fathers account and informed him that 
Mr H would need to report the fraud on his own account to Barclays himself. Mr Hs father 
told the agent that Mr H was on his way to the branch. 
From what I can tell, Barclays attempted to recover the funds from the beneficiary on or 
around 21 December 2020, but no funds remained. Theres nothing more Barclays could 
have done to help Mr H recover his funds, but this information does suggest that Mr H had 
been in touch with Barclays about the matter by that point at the very latest.
Mr Hs representative states that Mr H told them his father became aware of the situation 
only in March 2021 and he didnt discuss the issue with someone until January 2021. But the 
information Ive seen shows that his father knew  and had warned him about the scam  by 
15 December 2020 at the very latest. Yet, despite this warning, a discussion with Barclays, 
and a discussion with a work colleague in January 2021, Mr H went ahead with a further 
payment of £3,500 in January 2021. 
Having thought carefully about Mr Hs actions in December 2020-January 2021, while I 
acknowledge Mr Hs representative feels otherwise, Im not persuaded that a discussion with 
Barclays a few months earlier would have broken that spell. Mr H was so under the spell that 
he didnt listen to warnings from family. Im not persuaded that he would have listened to his 
bank either. I consider it more likely than not that Mr H would have attempted to send the 
payment by any means.
I recognise that this will come as a considerable disappointment to Mr H and Im sorry I 
havent written with better news. I acknowledge that hes experienced personal difficulties 
since losing a large sum of money to a cruel scam. But in the circumstances, Im not 
persuaded that Barclays can fairly or reasonably be held liable to reimburse him for his 
losses. Any failure on Barclays part in relation to not spotting the disputed payments as 
unusual or out of character is not the dominant, effective cause of Mr Hs loss.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2023.
