The complaint
Mr B complains that TransUnion International UK Limited included information on his credit 
file that belonged to his sibling. 
What happened
In about May 2021, Mr B applied for a mortgage in principle so that he could view a property 
he was thinking of buying. However, the lender told Mr B that there was a problem and 
suggested that he check things further with the credit reference agencies.
When Mr B viewed his credit report from TransUnion, he discovered that it contained 
information about his siblings finances. 
Mr B asked TransUnion to resolve the problem and was unhappy with its response. 
TransUnion did manage to separate Mr Bs data from that of his sibling but didnt uphold    
Mr Bs complaint. 
Mr B brought his complaint to this service and the investigator recommended that 
TransUnion pay him £200 compensation.
Mr B accepts the investigators recommendation but TransUnion hasnt replied, so the 
complaint has come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so 
using my own words. Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the key issues. The rules 
that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt mean that Ive not considered 
everything that both parties have given to me. 
My role is to consider whether TransUnion made a mistake and if so, whether it should do 
more than its already done to put things right. TransUnion reports data given to it by data 
suppliers and is generally reliant on those suppliers. However, I would expect TransUnion to 
query things with a data supplier if it was told about a problem  as was the case with Mr B 
The investigator asked TransUnion for details of what happened to cause the problem. But 
apart from saying that the link will have come from details a supplier has uploaded, 
TransUnion hasnt given any further explanation. 
 
As the investigator told Mr B, its possible that TransUnion itself may have caused the 
problem by merging the profiles of Mr B and his sibling. Without further evidence, I cant be 
sure of exactly what happened but I accept that something went wrong with Mr Bs credit 
report. 
Although TransUnion promptly corrected Mr Bs credit file, the mistake left him very 
concerned and fearful that hed been the victim of fraud. Mr B couldnt obtain the mortgage 
in principle when he wanted and I can see this caused him further inconvenience. The 
investigator recommended that TransUnion pay Mr B £200 to apologise and I consider this 
to be fair. 
The investigator also recommended that TransUnion should offer Mr B a free CIFAS 
protective maker for two years. This can be added to Mr Bs credit file to make organisations 
aware that his identity may be at risk, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent credit 
applications. If Mr B decides to go ahead and apply for a protective registration with CIFAS, I 
would expect TransUnion to bear the cost of his first application. 
Putting things right
To put things right, TransUnion International UK Limited should take the following steps:
pay Mr B £200; and 
if Mr B decides to apply for protective registration with CIFAS, TransUnion should 
reimburse the cost of his first application.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I direct TransUnion 
International UK Limited to take the steps outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
