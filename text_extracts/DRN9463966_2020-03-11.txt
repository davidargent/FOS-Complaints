Miss B says Elevate Credit International  Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about one running  credit account and eleven loans Sunny provided  to 
Miss B between August 2014  to August 2017.  Miss Bs borrowing history  is as follows:

*Loan one was a running credit account  Miss B could withdraw up to £350 at a time  and 
borrowed 12 various  amounts  over the period the account was open.
**At times, Miss B already had balances outstanding when she applied for a new loan  this is the 
highest total amount due in any one month for this loan and any outstanding.
Sunny has previously made an already  made an offer on loan one, which  was a running 
credit loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Bs complaint  and thought the loans  from loan two to twelve  
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed and then made an additional  offer from loan seven. So, the complaint was 
passed to me.
As loans  one, and seven  to twelve are no longer in dispute, I wont be considering these  
but I will take them in to account when  thinking about the other loans that Miss B took. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN94639662Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, by the time Miss B applied  for loan two, she had already  been 
in debt with Sunny for six months   having taken several draw downs on the running  credit 
facility it provided her with. 
Sunny explains  on its credit agreements that this type of lending is not suitable for borrowing 
over long periods   however while it stopped Miss B from making any further withdrawals on 
the running credit account, it instead allowed her to take out an instalment loan. And it 
shouldve realised that it was unlikely Miss B would  be able to sustainably repay this, or any 
subsequent loans.
As such,  it shouldnt have  continued the lending relationship with Miss B.  
Ref: DRN94639663Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out six loans  in thirteen months and Miss B had 
been indebted to Sunny for the entire time.  So Sunny ought to have  realised it was 
more likely than not Miss B was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying 
her previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Bs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Miss Bs loan two was for £100 and followed a running credit account and loan six 
was for £50  but she also already had two other loans outstanding. At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Miss B was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan twelve  
was taken out three years after Miss Bs first running account. And Miss B had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept him/her  in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans two to five and loan six onwards and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
make  sure that its previous offer on loan one, and loans seven to twelve is completed
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans two to six;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans two to five from Miss Bs credit file;
Ref: DRN94639664the number  of loans taken from six onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loan six onwards should  be removed from Miss 
Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Bs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should pay put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 April 2020.
