complaint
Mrs A is complaining on her own behalf and the estate of her late husband Mr A. Ill refer to 
the late Mr A as Mr A in my decision. I dont mean any disrespect by this.
Mrs A says Lloyds bank PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold them payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policies. 
background and summary to complaint
PPI covering the mortgage  May 1995 and additional lending  August 1995
Mr and Mrs A bought the initial policy in 1995 at the same time as taking out a mortgage. 
They applied for the mortgage and PPI policy in branch. 
Mr and Mrs A took out additional lending in August 1995 and the policy was amended at the 
same time.
The policy provided cover for Mr and Mrs A for accident, sickness, and unemployment  
subject to its exclusions and limitations. Lloyds hasnt been able to confirm how the benefit 
of the policy was split but, in my decision, I have assumed it was split equally between        
Mr and Mrs A. 
Lloyds hasnt been able to tell us the cost of the policy at the time of the May 1995 sale, but 
it has been able to tell us that after the policy was amended for the additional lending  
August 1995  it cost £39.60 per month. The policy offered to repay Mr and Mrs As 
mortgage repayment plus £3 for every £1,000 borrowed. So, it likely paid around £762.75 
per month, partly towards the mortgage balance as well a cash benefit, in the event of a 
successful claim. 
PPI covering additional lending  September 1998
Mr and Mrs A amended the policy in 1998 at the same time as taking out additional lending. 
Again, the application was made in branch.
 
This policy also provided the same cover and again I have assumed an 50/50 benefit split 
between Mr and Mrs A as Lloyds doesnt have this information. Lloyds cant tell us the cost 
of the policy at the time the policy was amended, but evidence from 2001 shows that the 
policy cost £46.10 per month. The policy would have paid the monthly mortgage repayment 
and the monthly benefit would have been around £681.17. 
PPI covering further advance  January 2000 
Mr and Mrs A bought a new policy in 2000 in branch at the same time as taking a further 
advance.
The policy provided the same cover as the earlier polices. Lloyds has been able to tell us the 
benefit was split 60% for Mr A and 40% for Mrs A. It offered to repay £257.14 a month 
towards Mr and Mrs As mortgage balance plus a cash benefit of £3.00 for every £1,000 
borrowed totalling £78.00 in the event of a successful claim. At the time, it cost £13.20 a 
month. 
Mr and Mrs As circumstances 
The application for the mortgage starting in May 1995 that Lloyds has given us shows that 
Mr A was employed as a security officer. Mrs A told us that Mr A was employed as an HGV 
driver and that he was entitled to at least 12 months full sick pay from his employer as well 
as death in service benefit and at least three months redundancy pay in the event he lost his 
job. But I think the application form is more likely to be Mr As circumstances at the time of 
the sale, although I can understand why Mrs A might not remember the details bearing in 
mind how long ago the sale took place. We asked Mrs A for further details about Mr As 
employee benefits, but we didnt receive anything further. Mr A was in good health at the 
time of the sale.
 
We also asked Mrs A about Mr As circumstances when the policy was amended in 1995 
and 1998 and for the new policy taken in 2000. But we didnt hear back from Mrs A, so I 
have relied upon the information we do have. 
At the time of the 1995 sale Mrs A told us she was employed in human resources. But the 
mortgage application shows that she was employed as a personal assistant (for the same 
company she had told us she was employed by). She told us she was entitled to at least 12 
months full pay if she was too unwell to work. She would receive redundancy pay in the 
event she lost her job as well as death in service benefit. Mrs A said she and Mr A had 
savings they could have relied upon to make the mortgage repayments if they werent 
working. Mrs A said she was diagnosed with a medical condition some time before the sale.  
Lloyds has sent us screenshots to show that the mortgage account started in 1995 and      
Mr and Mrs A took out additional lending in 1995 and 1998 and a further advance in 2000. 
The account closed in 2005. 
Mr and Mrs As representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on their 
behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have read and considered them all carefully. In 
summary, Mr and Mrs As representative says:
Lloyds failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying the regulators rules and guidance for businesses on 
handling PPI complaints under DISP App 3, it should be presumed Mr and Mrs A 
wouldnt have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.                   
Mr and Mrs As representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that 
presumption;
The policies excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress, which are some of 
the most common reasons people are off work. This significantly reduced the value 
of cover;
The true costs including interest and the fact it was unlikely you could make a 
successful claim meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good faith means Lloyds should have 
told Mr and Mrs A about the poor value; The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Lloyds should have explained 
the significance of the exclusions and limitations of cover to Mr and Mrs A and the 
impact they would have had on their chances of making a claim;
The policies only protected payments for the short-term, whereas a mortgage is 
generally someones biggest ever long- term transaction  cover would stop at the 
time it would be most needed; and
The information Mr and Mrs A received was misleading. These policies were 
promoted as providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations 
on the scope of the cover meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mr and Mrs A disagreed with the adjudicators 
opinion for several reasons.
 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered all 
the evidence and arguments available to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint.
 
Ive split my findings in this decision into two sections to take account of the different relevant 
considerations at the different dates of sale.
relevant considerations  May and August 1995
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr and Mrs As. I dont intend to set that 
out in much detail here, but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs As complaint.
These sales took place in 1995 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code of practice in June 2000 and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint, nor is the FCAs Perimeter Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded in 2005. That means the unfair relationship provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin about 
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling of 
complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the Plevin judgment, arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular, The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other 
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries 
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected of 
intermediaries like Lloyds at the time. So, Im satisfied I should take the ABI Code and these 
other publications into account when deciding, what is in my opinion, fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mr and Mrs As case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including: the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract (including the express and implied duty on 
professional advisers to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness. 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001, Im also required to take into account what 
determination the relevant former scheme  in this case the Office of the Banking 
Ombudsman  might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman was 
required to decide complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances  and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the sale 
of PPI. These sales took place before insurance mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were 
guidance when considering Mr and Mrs As complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account, it seems to me that the key questions I need 
to consider in deciding what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
- If Lloyds gave advice, whether it advised Mr and Mrs A with reasonable care and skill 
 in particular, whether the policies were appropriate or suitable for them, given their 
needs and circumstances. 
- Whether Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A sufficient, appropriate and timely information to 
enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policies, 
including drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not 
misleading way  the main provisions of the policies and significant limitations and 
exclusions. 
- If, having considered these questions, I determine the complaint in favour of            
Mr and Mrs A, I must then go on to consider whether and to what extent                  
Mr and Mrs A suffered loss or damage and what I consider would amount to fair 
compensation for that loss or damage. Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr and Mrs A 
and Lloyds, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs As complaint. Ive set out my reasoning 
below. 
did Mr and Mrs A know they had a choice?
For both of the sales Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional.               
Mr and Mrs A have said the PPI was included as part of the lending package. 
Lloyds has been able to give us some documents from the time of these earlier sales, but 
these mostly relate to the assessment for the lending and those applications. So, I dont 
have any of the documentation for the PPI applications. However, I dont find this surprising 
because of the length of time since the sales and the mortgage itself being redeemed. 
Clearly I cant know for sure what happened but the fact that PPI isnt mentioned on those 
loan assessment documents or lending applications makes me think it more likely that the 
PPI applications were separate documents  after all, the PPI was added for all of this 
lending and the payments for which most likely would have shown as separate debits on    
Mr and Mrs As bank statements from the mortgage payments  which would suggest there 
were discussions and agreements to take the polices in each case as the PPI was amended 
with the additional borrowing. Also, there is nothing on the documentation I do have that 
suggests the PPI had to be taken and was part of the lending package. 
Taking everything into account and there being nothing to the contrary for me to consider, I 
think its more likely that Mr and Mrs A knew the PPI was optional and they agreed to take it 
out without undue pressure. 
did Lloyds provide advice?
Lloyds has told us these were advised sales and as the policies were sold in branch, I think 
this is most likely what happened.
This means Lloyds had to advise Mr and Mrs A with reasonable care and skill, in particular 
whether the policies were appropriate or suitable given their needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps Lloyds took to establish whether the policies were a suitable 
recommendation for Mr and Mrs A. It seems Mr and Mrs A cant remember clearly what 
happened and there is no record of what the adviser discussed in relation to the policies. 
This is unsurprising in respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser had some limited 
information about Mr and Mrs As financial circumstances, but there is no specific evidence 
to show the adviser took steps to establish whether Mr and Mrs A would have been caught 
by the significant exclusions and limitations which might have meant the policies did not fully 
meet their needs. For example, there is nothing to suggest Lloyds considered whether       
Mr and Mrs A had any pre-existing medical conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should have done 
to determine whether the policies were suitable for Mr and Mrs A given their circumstances. 
So, Im not persuaded Lloyds advised with reasonable care and skill.
While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should have done to make sure the policies were 
suitable for Mr and Mrs A, I do think its more likely than not that the policies were ultimately 
suitable for them. The underlying policy for the 1995 sales was the same, and in reaching 
that conclusion Ive taken into consideration:- Mr and Mrs A met the eligibility criteria for the policy.
- Mr and Mrs A had a need for the PPI  it seems likely that Mr and Mrs As ability to 
continue to meet their mortgage repayments would have been put under strain if     
Mr and Mrs A were not working for an extended period of time  even allowing for the 
sick pay and redundancy benefits they say they would have been entitled to and the 
savings they say they had.
-The monthly cost of the PPI appears to have been affordable for Mr and Mrs A.
 
- The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable for Mr and Mrs A. 
There was nothing about Mr and Mrs As employment or occupation which would 
have made it difficult for them to claim. Regarding the pre-existing medical condition 
Mrs A has told us about, I understand this was diagnosed in 1985 and Mrs A took 
medication to keep it under control. And Mrs A hadnt taken any time off from work 
because of it so I think it unlikely she would have thought she would need to make a 
claim because of it. There were also no additional restrictions on cover for mental 
health or back problems.
- While the policy included a requirement that Mr and Mrs A be disabled or 
unemployed for 60 days before they could make a claim and would only pay benefits 
for a maximum of 12 months for each claim, they still provided valuable cover given: 
Mr and Mrs As circumstances, the fact the PPI protected the mortgage repayments 
relating to their home and the potential consequences should Mr and Mrs A be 
unable to make the repayments on loans secured against their house.
Ive also considered whether, when providing advice, Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable them to understand what Lloyds 
was recommending to them and make an informed decision about whether to follow that 
advice and take out the PPI.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs A were given a broad description of 
what the PPI intended to cover (that is that the PPI would protect their payments if              
Mr and Mrs A were unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment) and of the 
approximate costs. I have reached this conclusion because I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs A 
would have taken out the PPI without any sense of what the PPI was for and of how much 
the premiums might be.
But the evidence from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether Lloyds gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost or about the exclusions or 
limitations before Mr and Mrs A agreed to take out the PPI. 
Overall, having considered the parties representations about what happened, while Im 
satisfied the policies were suitable recommendations for Mr and Mrs A Im not persuaded 
Lloyds did enough to present information about the PPI it was recommending in a way that 
was fair and reasonable to them. Im not persuaded Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A all of the 
information they needed about the PPI to make an informed decision about whether to follow 
the recommendation and take it out.
Ive considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling PPI complaints set out at DISP App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded there were significant failings in this case.In addition to the failings Ive highlighted above, Mr and Mrs As representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like                
Mr and Mrs As. Ive considered these carefully and summarised them as:
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr and Mrs As representative considers to be 
poor value  and the fact that much of the premium went to the business rather than 
the insurer. 
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business shouldnt have just 
told Mr and Mrs A about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further 
and explained the significance of them to them. 
Im not persuaded by Mr and Mrs As representatives views on this. The duty of utmost good 
faith in insurance law imposed a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose material 
facts and not to make material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what a court 
would say  I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to 
disclose the claims ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations and 
exclusions in the way Mr and Mrs A have suggested. And taking into account the law, 
industry codes and standards of good industry practice applicable to this complaint, I dont 
think its fair and reasonable to conclude that Lloyds ought to have done either. 
what effect did Lloydss shortcomings have on Mr and Mrs A? To what extent did     
Mr and Mrs A suffer loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds didnt do all it should have done when it sold the PPI to Mr and Mrs A. 
So, I have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude            
Mr and Mrs A suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer this, I must decide whether 
or not Mr and Mrs A would have still taken out the PPI, had Lloyds done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded Lloyds took the steps it should have done to establish whether the 
PPI it recommended was suitable for Mr and Mrs A, I have found that the PPI was ultimately 
suitable for them.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether or not Mr and Mrs A have suffered loss 
or damage in this case primarily depends on whether, if Lloyds had explained things 
properly, Mr and Mrs A would have acted differently, or whether they would have taken out 
the PPI in any event.
Mr and Mrs A say they wouldnt have taken the PPI out and believe I should presume this to 
be the case given the significant failings identified above. Ive considered the representations 
of both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before deciding whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mr and Mrs A had some interest in taking out 
payment protection insurance. By this I mean when Lloyds advised them that there was a 
suitable product they could buy that would protect their mortgage payments in the event they 
were unable to work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, they concluded they wanted that product. But they made that decision based on incomplete information, meaning 
what they thought they were getting is not exactly what they got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about Mr and Mrs As circumstances at 
the time of the sales that the PPI was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them.
Although I consider it more likely than not that Mr and Mrs A knew they would have to pay 
something for the PPI, it doesnt appear Lloyds told them the exact premium at the point    
Mr and Mrs A applied for the PPI. Having said that, it seems likely Mr and Mrs A would have 
been told the cost before the PPI started and they paid for the PPI for a number of years, so 
if the costs were significantly at odds with their expectations at the point of sale, its possible 
they might have raised that with Lloyds at the time, or reconsidered their decision.
Overall, Im not persuaded Mr and Mrs A would have found the cost unacceptable if they had 
been given the exact figure during the meetings in which they agreed to the policies.
In addition, Im not persuaded Lloyds made clear exactly what Mr and Mrs A would get back 
in return in the event they made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs As 
expectations about what the policies would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient 
to meet their mortgage payment) were significantly different to what the policy actually did  
if anything, it is more likely than not that the policies actually paid more in the event of a 
claim than they would have expected as there was an additional cash payment.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr and Mrs A thought they had 
bought and what they actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to any pre-existing medical condition, injury, 
illness or sickness of which Mr and Mrs A were aware of, or for which they had 
consulted or been treated by a doctor during the 12 months immediately before the 
start date and which caused disability during the 24 months following the start date of 
the policy; 
The policy limited, and in some situations, excluded unemployment cover if             
Mr and Mrs A werent permanent employees;
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr and Mrs A be 
unable to do their own job, a similar job or any paid work which their experience, 
education or training reasonably qualified them to do;
The policy protected payments for up to 12 months, rather than the remaining term of 
the mortgage.  
I do accept there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions above might well have caused 
Mr and Mrs A pause for thought  and may well have caused them to conclude the PPI 
wasnt as good as they thought, and they might have decided not to proceed. The limitations 
on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in these sales, might have 
dissuaded some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr and Mrs A from 
taking out the PPI. 
But, the evidence about Mr and Mrs As circumstances at the time of sales shows that the 
PPI wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them. Mr and Mrs A were eligible for the 
benefits and they provided cover that, despite the limitations and exclusions, couldve proved 
valuable to them should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen any 
evidence to suggest Mr and Mrs A wouldve been caught by any of the significant exclusions 
 Mr and Mrs A were in permanent employment. And the pre-existing medical condition that 
Mrs A told us about was diagnosed in 1985 and was controlled by medication. And Mrs A 
hadnt taken any time off from work because of it so I think I unlikely she would have needed to make a claim because of it. So, I still think they had some good reasons to take the PPI 
out.
The policy didnt exclude back or mental health conditions or place any additional restrictions 
or more onerous evidential requirements in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied to any other disability claim. And I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs A would 
have expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some evidence 
to support that claim.
If Mr and Mrs A had known they could only claim for disability if they were unable to do both 
their job and any similar gainful occupation which in the insurers view They might 
reasonably become qualified for, it might have played into their thinking about what they 
would have done. And I accept it may have given them pause for thought  although its 
possible they may not have been overly concerned given that if Mr and Mrs A were unable 
(through disability) to carry on their own occupation the chances that they would be able to 
take up a similar occupation would also, in all probability, be limited.
Lloyds may not have told Mr and Mrs A that any claim they made would be limited to a 12-
month period. This may have differed from what they expected and might have hoped for.  
Mr and Mrs A have told us they were entitled to generous sick pay benefits they could have 
used so they didnt need the policy. Ive thought carefully about what theyve said, but its 
very unusual for an employer to provide 12 months full sick pay.
I think its likely Mr and Mrs A were entitled to some sick pay. But in my experience  and 
without evidence to show otherwise  I think its unlikely they would have received the level 
of sick pay theyve told us they were entitled to. And as the policy would have paid out 
alongside any sick pay they did get, and their statutory redundancy entitlements were also 
likely to be less than 12 months income, the PPI would have been useful to Mr and Mrs A if 
something went wrong.  
In those circumstances, I consider it likely Mr and Mrs A would still have thought a policy that 
paid up to 12 monthly mortgage payments would have been of benefit to them and would 
help them manage the consequences should Mr and Mrs A be unable to work in the 
circumstances covered by the PPI. The policy allowed for multiple claims to be made, it 
could help reduce their outgoings at a difficult and uncertain time and ensure their home was 
not placed at risk and might potentially help preserve Mr and Mrs As sick pay or redundancy 
money for other use.
 
Having considered all of the evidence and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs A would still have taken out the PPI. The policy was suitable for them, 
was sufficiently close to what its likely they thought they were getting and provided benefits 
that would help them manage the consequences if Mr and Mrs A were made redundant, or 
unable to work through accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs A would have taken out the PPI in any event notwithstanding the 
limitations on cover.
Mr and Mrs As representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 
3) make it clear that, where a significant failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have taken out PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms, but it is a relevant consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things when I decide what is in my opinion fair and reasonable. Considering 
the purpose of the guidance, I dont think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken. Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mr and Mrs A would not have bought the PPI they bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, its reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted in 
the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mr and Mrs As 
circumstances as detailed above, I consider it reasonable to conclude the position              
Mr and Mrs A found themselves in as a result of the sale was the same position they would 
have been in had the breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mr and Mrs A believe the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales 
process were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were highly material and we have failed 
to give proper weight to the evidence  including their own comments that they would not 
have taken out the PPI. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance for firms set out at DISP App 3 (which I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because I do not consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr and Mrs A in the position they would have been in if 
they had not bought the PPI. 
That is because, while I accept it is possible that they would not have taken out the PPI, I am 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that they would still have taken 
out the PPI had they been given clear, fair and not misleading information about the policy 
they were buying. So, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those 
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Mr and Mrs A compensation, as that would 
put them in a better position than They would have been in if everything had happened as it 
should have done. 
Im also aware that Mr and Mrs A think Lloyds misrepresented the terms of the policy in how 
it described the PPI.  While I accept there is a possibility a court might conclude some of 
Lloydss statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why Lloyds failed 
to act fairly and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because the overall information Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A, in the way it did, 
was insufficient to meet the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have 
met in 1995 when providing information about an insurance policy. 
Relevant considerations  September 1998 and January 2000
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr and Mrs As. I dont intend to set that 
out in much detail here, but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs As complaint.
These sales took place in 1998 and January 2000 before the General Insurance Standards 
Council (GISC) published its code of practice in June 2000 and before the sale of general 
insurance products like this became regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the 
FSAs (and FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses and insurance conduct rules 
(ICOB and ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint, nor is the FCAs Perimeter Guidance 
(PERG). The credit agreement itself concluded in 2005. That means the unfair relationship provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin about 
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling of 
complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the Plevin judgment, arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular, The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other 
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries 
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected of 
intermediaries like Lloyds at the time. So, Im satisfied I should take the ABI Code and these 
other publications into account when deciding, what is in my opinion, fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mr and Mrs As case. 
There was also the Mortgage Code which was a voluntary code followed by subscribing 
lenders and mortgage intermediaries. While predominantly about mortgage related matters, 
it also included some insurance related commitments. 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including: the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract (including the express and implied duty on 
professional advisers to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness. 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001, Im also required to take into account what 
determination the relevant former scheme  in this case the Office of the Banking 
Ombudsman  might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman was 
required to decide complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances  and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were 
guidance when considering Mr and Mrs As complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account, it seems to me that the key questions I need 
to consider in deciding what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:- If Lloyds gave advice, whether it advised Mr and Mrs A with reasonable care and skill 
 in particular, whether the PPI was appropriate or suitable for them, given their 
needs and circumstances. 
- Whether Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A sufficient, appropriate and timely information to 
enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the PPI, including 
drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  
the main provisions of the policies and significant limitations and exclusions. 
- If, having considered these questions, I determine the complaint in favour of            
Mr and Mrs A, I must then go on to consider whether and to what extent                  
Mr and Mrs A suffered loss or damage and what I consider would amount to fair 
compensation for that loss or damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr and Mrs A 
and Lloyds, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs As complaint. Ive set out my reasoning 
below. 
did Mr and Mrs A know they had a choice?
Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. 
Again, Lloyds has been able to give us some of additional lending documents for the sale 
made in 1998 but I dont have anything for the sale of the PPI. And similar to what I have 
said above for the earlier sales, I dont find this surprising. But again, the fact that the PPI 
policy was amended after this sale would suggest there was some discussion and 
agreement about it.
Lloyds has been able to give us the documents for the PPI sale made in 2000 which were 
separate from the further advance application. I have a copy of the C&G Payment 
Protection Plus Proposal Form which has been completed by hand and which suggests it 
was clear there was a discussion about the policy as the benefit cover was split 60% for       
Mr A and 40% for Mrs A. Mr and Mrs A also completed a bank direct debit so that the 
monthly premiums could be taken from their bank account. There is nothing on the further 
advance application documents that suggests Mr and Mrs A had to take the PPI. 
 
So again, taking everything into account, I think its more likely that Mr and Mrs A knew the 
policy was optional and they agreed to take it out without undue pressure. 
did Lloyds provide advice?
Lloyds has told us that it recommended these policies to Mr and Mrs A. And as these were in 
branch sales, I think this was most likely. 
This means Lloyds had to advise Mr and Mrs A with reasonable care and skill, in particular 
whether the policies were appropriate or suitable given their needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps Lloyds took to establish whether the policies were a suitable 
recommendation for both sales for Mr and Mrs A. It seems Mr and Mrs A cant remember 
clearly what happened and there is no record of what the adviser discussed in relation to the 
policies. This is unsurprising in respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser had some 
limited information about Mr and Mrs As financial circumstances, but there is no specific 
evidence to show the adviser took steps to establish whether Mr and Mrs A would have been caught by the significant exclusions and limitations which might have meant the policies did 
not fully meet their needs. For example, there is nothing to suggest Lloyds considered 
whether Mr and Mrs A had any pre-existing medical conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should have done 
to determine whether the policies were suitable for Mr and Mrs A given their circumstances. 
So, Im not persuaded Lloyds advised with reasonable care and skill.
While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should have done to make sure the policies were 
suitable for Mr and Mrs A, I do think its more likely than not that the policies were ultimately 
suitable for them. In reaching that conclusion Ive taken into consideration:
- Mr and Mrs A met the eligibility criteria for the policies.
- Mr and Mrs A had a need for the policies  it seems likely that Mr and Mrs As ability 
to continue to meet their mortgage repayments would have been put under strain if 
Mr and Mrs A were not working for an extended period of time  even allowing for 
sick pay and redundancy benefits they say they were entitled to and the savings they 
say they had.
-The monthly cost of the policies appears to have been affordable for Mr and Mrs A. 
- The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policies unsuitable for Mr and Mrs A. 
There was nothing about Mr and Mrs As employment or occupation which would 
have made it difficult for them to claim. Mr and Mrs A were both in permanent 
employment. And as I have said above about the pre-existing medical condition    
Mrs A told us about  it was controlled by medication and Mrs A didnt tell us of any 
time off from work because of it  so I think it unlikely she would have thought she 
would have needed to make a claim because of it. There were also no additional 
restrictions on cover for mental health or back problems.
- While the policies included a requirement that Mr and Mrs A be disabled or 
unemployed for 60 days before they could make a claim and would only pay benefits 
for a maximum of 12 months for each claim, they still provided valuable cover given: 
Mr and Mrs As circumstances, the fact the policies protected the mortgage 
repayments relating to their home and the potential consequences should               
Mr and Mrs A be unable to make the repayments on loans secured against their 
house.
Ive also considered whether, when providing advice, Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policies to enable them to understand what 
Lloyds was recommending to them and make an informed decision about whether to follow 
that advice and take out the policies.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs A were given a broad description of 
what the policies were intended to cover (that is that the policies would protect their 
payments if Mr and Mrs A were unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment) 
and of the approximate costs. I have reached this conclusion because I think its unlikely    
Mr and Mrs A would have taken out the policies without any sense of what the policies were 
for and of how much the premiums might be.But the evidence from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether Lloyds gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost or about the exclusions or 
limitations before Mr and Mrs A agreed to take out the policies.
 
Overall, having considered the parties representations about what happened, while Im 
satisfied the policies were suitable recommendations for Mr and Mrs A Im not persuaded 
Lloyds did enough to present information about the policies it was recommending in a way 
that was fair and reasonable to them. Im not persuaded Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A all of the 
information they needed about the polices to make an informed decision about whether to 
follow the recommendation and take them out.
Ive considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling PPI complaints set out at DISP App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings Ive highlighted above, Mr and Mrs As representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like                
Mr and Mrs As. Ive considered these carefully and summarised them as:
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr and Mrs As representative considers to be 
poor value  and the fact that much of the premium went to the business rather than 
the insurer. 
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business shouldnt have just 
told Mr and Mrs A about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further 
and explained the significance of them to them. 
Im not persuaded by Mr and Mrs As representatives views on this. The duty of utmost good 
faith in insurance law imposed a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose material 
facts and not to make material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what a court 
would say  I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to 
disclose the claims ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations and 
exclusions in the way Mr and Mrs A have suggested. And taking into account the law, 
industry codes and standards of good industry practice applicable to this complaint, I dont 
think its fair and reasonable to conclude that Lloyds ought to have done either. 
what effect did Lloydss shortcomings have on Mr and Mrs A? To what extent did     
Mr and Mrs A suffer loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds didnt do all it should have done when it sold these policies to            
Mr and Mrs A. So, I have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to 
conclude Mr and Mrs A suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer this, I must decide 
whether or not Mr and Mrs A would have still taken out the policies, had Lloyds done things 
properly. 
While Im not persuaded Lloyds took the steps it should have done to establish whether the 
policies it recommended were suitable for Mr and Mrs A, I have found that the policies were 
ultimately suitable for them.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether or not Mr and Mrs A have suffered loss 
or damage in this case primarily depends on whether, if Lloyds had explained things 
properly, Mr and Mrs A would have acted differently, or whether they would have taken out 
the policies in any event.Mr and Mrs A say they wouldnt have taken them out and believe I should presume this to be 
the case given the significant failings identified above. Ive considered the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before deciding whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mr and Mrs A had some interest in taking out 
payment protection insurance. By this I mean when Lloyds advised them that there was a 
suitable product they could buy that would protect their mortgage payments in the event they 
were unable to work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, they concluded they 
wanted that product. But they made that decision based on incomplete information, meaning 
what they thought they were getting is not exactly what they got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about Mr and Mrs As circumstances at 
the time of the sale that the policies were not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them.
Although I consider it more likely than not that Mr and Mrs A knew they would have to pay 
something for the policies, it doesnt appear Lloyds told them the exact premiums at the 
point Mr and Mrs A applied for the policies. Having said that, it seems likely Mr and Mrs A 
would have been told the cost before the policies started and they paid for the policies for a 
number of years, so if the costs were significantly at odds with their expectations at the point 
of the sales, its possible they might have raised that with Lloyds at the time, or reconsidered 
their decision.
Overall, Im not persuaded Mr and Mrs A would have found the costs unacceptable if they 
had been given the exact figure during the meetings in which they agreed to the policies.
In addition, Im not persuaded Lloyds made clear exactly what Mr and Mrs A would get back 
in return in the event they made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs As 
expectations about what the policies would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient 
to meet their mortgage payment) were significantly different to what the policies actually did 
 if anything, it is more likely than not that the policy taken in 2000 actually paid more in the 
event of a claim than they would have expected as there was an additional cash payment.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr and Mrs A thought They had 
bought and what they actually bought were the following:
The policies excluded claims relating to any condition, injury, illness, disease or 
sickness which Mr and Mrs A knew about or should reasonably have known about or 
about which you had seen or arranged to see a doctor or for which they had received 
treatment from a doctor during the 12 months before the start date of the policy. Or a 
disability due to a pre-existing medical condition occurring or re-occurring during first 
24 months of the cover; 
The policies limited, and in some situations, excluded unemployment cover if          
Mr or Mrs A werent permanent employees;
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr and Mrs A be 
unable to do their own job, a similar job or any paid work which their ability, education 
or training reasonably qualified them to do;
The policies protected payments for up to 12 months, rather than the remaining term 
of the mortgage.  I do accept there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions above might well have caused 
Mr and Mrs A pause for thought  and may well have caused them to conclude the policies 
werent as good as they thought, and they might have decided not to proceed. The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in the sales, might have 
dissuaded some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr and Mrs A from 
taking out the policies. 
But, the evidence about Mr and Mrs As circumstances at the time of sales shows that the 
policies werent fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them. Mr and Mrs A were eligible for 
the benefits and they provided cover that, despite their limitations and exclusions, couldve 
proved valuable to them should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen 
any evidence to suggest Mr and Mrs A wouldve been caught by any of the significant 
exclusions  they were both in permanent employment. And as I have said above, the 
medical condition Mrs A told us about was diagnosed in 1985 and was controlled by 
medication. And Mrs A didnt tell us of any time off from work because of it so I dont think 
she would have thought it likely that she would need to make a claim because of it. So, I still 
think They had some good reasons to take the policies out.
The policies didnt exclude back or mental health conditions or place any additional 
restrictions or more onerous evidential requirements in the event of a claim on those 
grounds than would have applied to any other disability claim. And I think its unlikely Mr and 
Mrs A would have expected to make a disability claim on the policies without first providing 
some evidence to support that claim.
If Mr and Mrs A had known they could only claim for disability if they were unable to do both 
their job and any similar gainful occupation which in the insurers view they might 
reasonably become qualified for, it might have played into their thinking about what they 
would have done. And I accept it may have given them pause for thought  although its 
possible they may not have been overly concerned given that if Mr and Mrs A were unable 
(through disability) to carry on their own occupation the chances that they would be able to 
take up a similar occupation would also, in all probability, be limited.
Lloyds may not have told Mr and Mrs A that any claim they made would be limited to a 12-
month period. This may have differed from what they expected and might have hoped for.   
Mr and Mrs A have told us they were entitled to generous sick pay benefits they could have 
used so they didnt need the policies. Ive thought carefully about what theyve said, but its 
very unusual for an employer to provide 12 months full sick pay.
I think its likely Mr and Mrs A were entitled to some sick pay. But in my experience  and 
without evidence to show otherwise  I think its unlikely they would have received the level 
of sick pay theyve told us they were entitled to. And as the policies would have paid out 
alongside any sick pay they did get, and their statutory redundancy entitlement was also 
likely to be less than 12 months income, it would have been useful to Mr and Mrs A if 
something went wrong.  
In those circumstances, I consider it likely Mr and Mrs A would still have thought a policy that 
paid up to 12 monthly mortgage payments would have been of benefit to them and would 
help them manage the consequences should Mr and Mrs A be unable to work in the 
circumstances covered by the policies. The policies allowed for multiple claims to be made, 
they could help reduce their outgoings at a difficult and uncertain time and ensure their home 
was not placed at risk and might potentially help preserve Mr and Mrs As sick pay or 
redundancy money for other use.
 
Having considered all of the evidence and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs A would still have taken out the policies. The policies were suitable for them, was sufficiently close to what its likely they thought they were getting and provided 
benefits that would help them manage the consequences if Mr and Mrs A were made 
redundant, or unable to work through accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it 
more likely than not Mr and Mrs A would have taken out the policies in any event 
notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Mr and Mrs As representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 
3) make it clear that, where a significant failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have taken out PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms, but it is a relevant consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things when I decide what is in my opinion fair and reasonable. Considering 
the purpose of the guidance, I dont think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken. 
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mr and Mrs A would not have bought the PPI they bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, its reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted in 
the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mr and Mrs As 
circumstances as detailed above, I consider it reasonable to conclude the position              
Mr and Mrs A found themselves in as a result of the sales was the same position they would 
have been in had the breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mr and Mrs A believe the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales 
process were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were highly material and we have failed 
to give proper weight to the evidence  including their own comments that they would not 
have taken out the policies. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance for firms set out at DISP App 3 (which I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because I do not consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr and Mrs A in the position they would have been in if 
they had not bought the policies. 
That is because, while I accept it is possible that they would not have taken out the policies, I 
am satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that they would still have 
taken out the PPI had they been given clear, fair and not misleading information about the 
policies they were buying. So, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those 
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Mr and Mrs A compensation, as that would 
put them in a better position than they would have been in if everything had happened as it 
should have done. 
Im also aware that Mr and Mrs A think Lloyds misrepresented the terms of the policies in 
how it described the PPI.  While I accept there is a possibility a court might conclude some 
of Lloydss statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why Lloyds 
failed to act fairly and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the 
information it provided  but because the overall information Lloyds gave Mr and Mrs A, in 
the way it did, was insufficient to meet the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to 
expect it to have met in 1998 and 2000 when providing information about an insurance 
policy. Ive also thought about the approach Mr and Mrs As representative says a court might take 
if it were to find Lloyds negligently misrepresented the contract to Mr and Mrs A and about 
the remedy a court might award if it were to find that Lloyds had been in breach of its duty of 
utmost good faith. But this doesnt persuade me to alter my conclusions about what is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair 
compensation in the circumstances of this case. For the reasons Ive already set out I dont 
think it would be fair and reasonable to put Mr and Mrs A in a better position than if 
everything had happened as it should have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A on her own 
behalf and the estate of the late Mr A to accept or reject my decision before 17 September 
2021.
