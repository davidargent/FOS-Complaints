K820x#14complaint
Mr K says HSBC Bank Plc (HSBC) mis-sold a Plus packaged bank account to him in 2007. 
Hes used a Claims Management Company  (CMC) to make his complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ks complaint  already and didnt think  that HSBC  mis-sold the 
packaged account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ks complaint.  Having done  so, I dont think HSBC  mis-sold the Plus 
account to Mr K. Id like to explain why I think thats the case.  
Its common knowledge that free accounts are widely available in the United Kingdom. So I 
think that Mr K wouldve known HSBC did free accounts as he already had one and that he 
couldve had one of those if thats what he really  wanted.
I dont think the Plus account  was recommended to Mr K. So it was up to Mr K to decide if 
the Plus account  was right for him. I think that Mr K couldve used some  the main  benefits 
included on the account and it was up to him to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Mr K wasnt told absolutely everything  he needed to know  about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest he wouldve been  affected by the main 
limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a difference and 
I think Mr K was given enough  to know and understand what  he was choosing  to agree to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2019.
