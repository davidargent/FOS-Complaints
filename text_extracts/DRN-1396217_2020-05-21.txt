The complaint
Mr T complains about the amount that he's been charged by RCI Financial Services Limited, 
trading as Renault Finance, for the hire of an electric car battery under a hire agreement. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new electric car was supplied to Mr T under a hire purchase agreement with 
Renault Finance that he signed in June 2016 and which included an annual mileage 
allowance of 6,000 miles;
a battery for the car was supplied to him under a hire agreement with Renault 
Finance that he also signed in June 2016 in which he agreed to make 36 monthly 
payments of £70 for the battery;
he bought the car in June 2019 when the hire purchase agreement ended and says 
that he agreed in May 2019 to pay £48.98 each month to hire the battery - but he 
says that he found out at that time that the £70 monthly charge was for an annual 
mileage of 7,500 miles and that Renault Finance introduced tiered lease 
payments shortly after the car was supplied to him;
he says that he's been paying for the battery for an annual mileage of 7,500 miles 
when the annual mileage allowance under his agreement was 6,000 miles and he's 
only averaged 4,000 miles annual usage - so he says that he's paid up to £750 more 
to hire the battery than he should have done over a three year period and that 
Renault Finance should refund that to him;
the dealer says that Mr T wasn't offered a lower mileage allowance because one 
wasn't available when the car was supplied to him and that he was placed on the 
lowest mileage allowance that was available at that time;
Renault Finance has provided evidence to show that the 4,500 annual mileage 
allowance and the lower monthly battery cost didn't become available until October 
2016;
Mr T had signed the hire agreement to say that he wanted to be legally bound by its 
terms and the monthly charge of £70 for the battery was clearly set out in the 
agreement;
Mr T had agreed to pay £70 each month for the battery and I'm not persuaded that 
there was any requirement for Renault Finance to lower that amount when it made 
changes to its charging structure in October 2016 - or at any time during the term of 
the hire agreement;I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that Renault Finance has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr T and I don't consider that there's any basis 
on which it should refund to Mr T any of the payments that he made under the hire 
agreement; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Renault Finance to refund to Mr T any of the payments that he made under the hire 
agreement for the battery - or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr T's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
