Our adjudicator upheld Mr Cs complaint about loans 7 onwards and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Sunny could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Our adjudicator felt that the complaint 
about loans 1  6 shouldnt be upheld. Mr C seems to have agreed with this opinion, so as 
these loans are no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further. Our adjudicator also 
felt that the gap in lending, between when loan 1 was paid off and loan 2 was taken out, was 
significant enough to break the chain and create a second loan chain. This gap was for 
almost two years, so I also agree that this was significant enough to create a gap in the 
lending. Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Looking at the second chain of lending, Mr C had taken out six loans 
within five months and most of these were taken in quick succession. So, it seems 
like a pattern was emerging and Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not Mr C was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Cs loans were for between £300 and £800, and he often took out more than one 
loan in a month, and often within days of each other. So, at the point of applying for 
loan 7 Sunny ought to have known that Mr C was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
Mr C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 11 was 
taken out seven months after the first loan in this lending chain. And although the 
amounts borrowed varied, it doesnt look like they were consistently decreasing over 
time. So, Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 7 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 7 - 11;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; 
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 should be 
removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr C compensation as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2020.
