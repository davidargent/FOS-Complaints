The complaint
Mr A complains about the service he received from Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 
118 118 Money) after he made a large repayment on his loan.
 
What happened
Mr A borrowed £5,000 from 118 118 Money on 7 March 2021. He was scheduled to repay
£164.45 per month for 60 months until 2 March 2026.
Mr A made a repayment of £4,800 on 29 March 2021 but doesnt agree with how 118 118 
Money have applied this to his account. He says he should only be charged interest on the 
full amount for 21 days and then interest should only be charged on the remaining £200. 
Mr A says the £4,800 was not applied to the loan, but instead it was kept on account until 
August. He says hes asked for evidence of the calculations, but he hasnt received anything. 
Mr A adds that his work duties have been disrupted due to having to make several phone 
calls and the stress has affected him mentally.
118 118 Money says there was some confusion on the call when Mr A paid the £4,800 and
the money was applied as a credit to the account, rather than a partial settlement. It says
Mr A can choose to apply the credit to the monthly instalments, or the term of the loan.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied that
118 118 Money had provided clear information and could not agree it had made an error.
Mr A responded to say, in summary, that his repayment should have resulted in either a 
reduced term, or reduced repayments, neither of which was the case.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr A and to 118 118 Money on 5 November 2021. Ive 
summarised my findings:
Mr A repaid £4,800 on 29 March 2021;
He was reluctant to say it was a partial settlement because 118 118 Money explained 
there would be an early settlement fee;
I found 118 118 Money was entitled to apply an early settlement fee as per the terms 
and conditions of the account;
118 118 Money applied the money to Mr As account on 30 July 2021 resulting in a 
rebate of £4,019.13 (compared with the original contractual interest of £4,867);
I noted that in 118 118 Moneys final response, dated 11 May 2021, it calculated the 
interest rebate at that point would be £4,350.83 if Mr A chose to reduce the term of 
the loan, rather than the repayments. But, as Mr A did not accept the final response, 
this wasnt actioned;
Mr A repaid the loan in full, in September 2021, having chosen to reduce its term, 
rather than make smaller repayments for the five-year duration.
My provisional decision was that 118 118 Money should re-work Mr As loan account with 
the repayment being applied to the account on 29 March 2021 and the money used to 
reduce the loan term. I said the interest rebate should be calculated from that date and any 
over-payment should be refunded to Mr A. I also accepted that Mr A had been caused 
unnecessary stress and frustration from ongoing dialogue with 118 118 Money and 
considered he should be awarded £100 in that regard.
Mr A responded and said that 118 118 Money never told him the loan was front-loaded at 
the time he took it out and wants the loan recalculated based on the interest rate and 
duration of the loan, given the large lump sum repayment.
118 118 Money responded to say, in summary, that it made every effort to try and work with 
Mr A to agree how the funds should be applied to the account. It says that during the call on 
29 March 2021 Mr A was given the option of a full or partial settlement of the account but 
declined both options. Therefore, it says, it did not trigger an interest rebate. 118 118 Money 
says it wasnt until 30 July 2021 that Mr A agreed to use the funds as a settlement. It 
forwarded all the relevant call recordings for review.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive now reviewed all the call recordings sent by 118 118 Money. It is clear to me that Mr A 
did not want to use the money as a partial settlement as he believed, by not doing, he would 
avoid the early settlement fee. However, Mr A reiterated many times, over many calls, that 
he wanted to know how much interest hed saved by making the £4,800 payment at the end 
of March 2021. 118 118 Money tried to explain that the money hadnt been applied to his 
account because he didnt want it used as a settlement, and, in a call in April 2021, it told 
Mr A he wouldnt save any interest without agreeing to use the money as a settlement. But I 
havent heard evidence that it explained:
Mr A could not avoid the early settlement fee if he wanted to save interest on the 
account by repaying the lump sum;
The only way Mr A would get an interest rebate is if the early settlement fee was also 
applied;
The more he delayed agreeing to have the money used as a settlement, the smaller 
the interest rebate would be.
I consider it likely, therefore, that had this all been fully explained to Mr A during the first call 
on 29 March 2021 he would have agreed to use the money as a partial settlement then.I understand Mr A was trying to avoid incurring the early settlement fee, but, as I said in my 
provisional decision, Im satisfied 118 118 Money was entitled to apply it to a full or partial 
settlement. But I dont think it was reasonable for 118 118 Money to apply the lump sum to 
Mr As account four months after he paid it, given that Im not satisfied the consequences 
were fully explained to Mr A when he didnt agree to a partial settlement. Its clear from the 
many times Mr A asked about his interest savings that he hadnt been made properly aware 
that each day he delayed agreeing to a partial settlement was financially detrimental to him.
So, in summary, having now listened to the calls, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision and find 118 118 Money should rework the account based on the 
£4,800 having been applied as a partial settlement on 29 March 2021.
I also understand Mr As concerns that one of the customer advisors described his loan as 
front loaded. This does not mean Mr As payments repay all the interest before the capital. 
It simply means that a breakdown of the earlier repayments would show a higher interest 
figure as more money is owed at the beginning. However, the interest charged assumes that 
the loan runs to term and enables equal monthly instalments. If the loan term is reduced, as 
is the case here, the interest charged reduces accordingly. The term front loaded has no 
impact on the total amount of interest Mr A will have paid.
Nevertheless, I acknowledge that Mr A has requested a breakdown in writing of the 
calculations used by 118 118 Money several times. So, I consider it reasonable that 118 118 
Money provides a copy of the calculations when it reworks the account as directed.
Finally, I still consider 118 118 Money should pay Mr A £100 for his inconvenience, 
especially as Ive now listened to almost six hours of calls where Mr A has asked for 
information about his interest saving.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) should:
Rework Mr As loan account to calculate the interest rebate based on the £4,800 
being applied to his account on 29 March 2021;
Share with Mr A a copy of that calculation;
Refund to Mr A the over-payment he has made;
Pay Mr A £100 for the distress and inconvenience this has caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2022.
