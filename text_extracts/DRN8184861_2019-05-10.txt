K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains about Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) and its decision not to progress a
chargeback claim. 
Mr W complains that Barclays  gave  him misleading  information about his claims and sided 
with the merchant company. He wants his payments to the merchant  to be returned  to him, 
and compensation  for the inconvenience he has suffered.
background
I set out the background  to this complaint, and my provisional findings, in a provisional
decision issued in April 2019.  A copy of that decision  is attached  to this.
In that provisional  decision, I explained  why I thought  the complaint should be partially 
upheld, but that I though Barclays had made a reasonable offer to settle the complaint.
That provisional decision has been  shared with the parties and they have been invited to
comment.
Neither the business, nor Mr W. have  responded to the provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no further  arguments or evidence have  been  submitted in response to my provisional  
decision, my view remains the same as in that provisional decision.
I therefore adopt my provisional decision and reasoning as my final decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision,  I uphold Mr Ws complaint in
relation to the information he received during his calls with Barclays, but I do not uphold his
complaint in relation to Barclays not progressing the chargeback claims.
I consider that Barclays has made an appropriate offer of compensation to reflect its
failings and I would not ask Barclays Bank UK Plc to do anything  further.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
