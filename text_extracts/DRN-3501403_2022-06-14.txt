The complaint
Mrs B and Mr B say U K Insurance Limited (UKI) didnt offer them enough for their written-
off car when they made a claim on their motor insurance policy.
What happened
UKI offered Mr and Mrs B £18,555 for the car, but they said the price shown for similar 
vehicles was a minimum of £21,500  with no room for negotiation. One of our investigators 
reviewed Mr and Mrs Bs complaint. She thought UKI had acted fairly in relying on the 
valuations set out in the national trade guides in order to find the likely market value for the 
car. As Mr and Mrs B disagreed, the complaint was passed to me for review.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Under the policy, UKI was required to pay Mr and Mrs B the market value for their car. We 
think the fairest way to establish a cars likely market value is to rely on trade guide 
valuations. The data in them is updated regularly to reflect market trends and is based on 
extensive research nationwide. We checked to ensure that the valuations UKI quoted were 
correct. As Mr and Mrs B saw many similar cars advertised at higher prices, I can see why 
they think UKI should have offered them more. But as I dont think it acted unreasonably in 
the way it valued Mr and Mrs Bs car, I cant uphold their complaint.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the  Financial Ombudsman 
Services rules, I must ask Mrs B and Mr B to accept or reject my decision by 12 July 2022.
