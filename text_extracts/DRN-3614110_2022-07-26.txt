The complaint
Ms P complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) wont refund payments she made after falling
victim to a scam.
What happened
In May 2021, Ms P says she was contacted via a messaging app by someone she didnt
know  who Ill refer to as G. G had a profile page which Ms P says had lots of people
thanking G for help with trading. Ms P saw a post that G made, which said people shouldnt
miss out on the investment opportunity presented by trading, and in response Ms P
contacted G.
Ms P says G told her she did forex trading and could help Ms P make same day
returns and profits.
Ms P made her first payment of £250 from an account held with another bank. In summary,
between May 2021 and September 2021 Ms P made over 42 payments as part
of the scam using multiple different bank accounts at different providers.
All of the payments made out of Ms Ps Monzo account were made in US dollars via a
money transfer service to an international bank account.
Below is a list of the payments Ms P made from her Monzo account  in bold. Ive also
included payments that were made into Ms Ps account as part of the scam.

What Ms P says happened:
She was told that for a £250 investment she would get a £8,500 return  and could
get a return as high as £25,000.
Ms P was told that through a company (who Ill refer to as C), she would be investing
in Forex, and that C would place trades on her behalf. G would earn money by taking
30% commission from Ms Ps returns.
After making her payment of £250, she received an email saying she was a bonus
winner and could get £25,000 - but had to pay service fees.
Ms P looked up C online and saw their website. However, she received no
paperwork and didnt have access to any sort of portal so couldnt track her
investment after making payments.
She says she was told stories about delays affecting her ability to get her returns as
promised.
She was told to lie to the bank when asked questions about the payments made on
her account. However, Ms P felt uncomfortable lying and ultimately told them the
truth.
Ms P continued making payments until September 2021 when one of her cards with
a different bank was blocked by the bank. At which point Ms P became aware she
was the victim of a scam and reported it.
Monzo investigated Ms Ps fraud claim but declined to refund her.
Monzo arent a signatory of the Lending Standards Board Contingent Reimbursement Model
Code (the CRM Code) which requires firms to reimburse customers who have been the
victims of APP scams like this in all but a limited number of circumstances, but it has agreed
to apply its principles. Monzo told Ms P that, as the funds were international transfers, Ms P
wasnt entitled to a refund under the CRM Code. Monzo did offer Ms P £25, saying they had
given her an incorrect reason for not being able to reimburse her when she first contacted
them.
Ms P wasnt happy with Monzos response, so she brought a complaint to our service.
An investigator looked into Ms Ps complaint and didnt uphold it. In summary, they didnt
think the payments were unusual or out of character, so couldnt see that Monzo shouldve
prevented the payments. They felt Monzo shouldve done more to try and recover the funds
but didnt think that it was likely any further funds couldve been recovered.Ms P disagreed, so the case was passed to me to review.
My provisional findings
On 4 July 2022, I issued a provisional decision as I needed to address points that werent 
covered by the investigator. I asked for both parties to provide any more comments or 
evidence they wanted to be considered before issuing my final decision. 
In my provisional decision I said:
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint, Im required to
take in account relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards;
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to be good industry practice at the
time. Where there is a dispute about what happened, and the evidence is incomplete or
contradictory, Ive reached my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, on
what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available evidence.
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that a firm is expected to process payments
and withdrawals that its customer authorises, in accordance with the Payment Services
Regulations and the terms and conditions of the customers account.
In this case, as the payments were international transfers, they arent covered by the
Contingent Reimbursement Model (the CRM Code).
Should Monzo have prevented Ms P from making the payments?
There is an obligation on Monzo to be on the lookout for, and to protect its customers from,
potentially falling victim to fraud or scams. This includes monitoring accounts and identifying
suspicious activity that appears unusual and out of character. In situations where potential
fraud is identified, I would expect Monzo to intervene and attempt to prevent losses for the
customer.
In this case, considering the size of the payments, the frequency of the payments and       
Ms Ps previous account use Im not persuaded that the payments made as part of the scam 
are so unusual or out of character that I wouldve expected them to flag with Monzo. On that
basis, I wouldnt have expected Monzo to intervene prior to processing the payments.
I say this because the first payment was only for £500, and while I appreciate this is a lot of
money for Ms P, its not significantly larger than previous genuine payments or transfers.
Ms P regularly transferred £100 to £130 out of her account monthly, as well as making some
individual payments of between £100 to £200. Also, there are gaps between most of the
scam payments of several days. There were four payments made on 8 June 2021, but three
of these went to one payee (an existing payee used previously) and altogether the payments
totalled just over £1,500. Overall, Im not satisfied that there was enough about these
payments that Monzo shouldve been concerned Ms P mightve been at risk of financial
harm.
Also, there has to be a balance struck between Monzo identifying payments that may
indicate a customer is potentially at risk of financial harm and then responding appropriately
to any concerns  and ensuring minimal disruption to legitimate payments. Overall, Im not
satisfied that Monzo shouldve intervened or prevented these payments from being made.
Its also worth noting that while Ms P made payments of just over £4,000 from her Monzo
account, just over £1,000 was returned to Ms Ps account. Also, Ms P was in receipt of just
under £2,800 of funds from other victims of the scam, which she used in sending paymentsto the scammer. Ms P wouldnt be entitled to a refund whereby the payment was funded by
someone elses money, particularly when it was from other victims of the scam.
Its not clear that Monzo contacted the beneficiary bank at their earliest opportunity to try and
recover Ms Ps funds once shed made them aware of the scam. But Im not satisfied that
even if they had it wouldve resulted in them recovering any more money for Ms P. Her last
payment made to the scam from her Monzo account was in June 2021, but she didnt report
the scam until September 2021  nearly three months later. Usually funds are removed from
the beneficiary account as quickly as possible after receipt, as the scam could be uncovered
at any time. So, Im not persuaded that prompter action by Monzo wouldve made a
difference in this case.
Monzo has paid Ms P £25, saying they gave an incorrect explanation for why they couldnt
refund her when she initially reported the scam. Considering everything, I think this payment
is fair and I wont be asking Monzo to pay anything further.
Having considered everything very carefully Im not persuaded that I can fairly ask Monzo to
refund Ms P in the circumstances.
Responses to the provisional decision
Monzo responded saying they accepted the provisional decision. Ms P didnt respond, 
despite us contacting her on 11 July 2022 to check shed received the provisional decision 
and asking for her response before the deadline of 25 July 2022.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I havent been given any new information or evidence, I see no reason to depart from the 
outcome I reached in my provisional decision. On that basis, Im not persuaded I can fairly 
ask Monzo to refund Ms P.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint against Monzo Bank Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
