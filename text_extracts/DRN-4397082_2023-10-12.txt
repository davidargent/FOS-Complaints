The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Pulse allowed him to carry out a balance 
transfer to his wifes credit card and then didnt assist when he informed it of the mistake. 
What happened
Mr B has a credit card account with NewDay. On 12 January 2023, he completed a balance 
transfer from his NewDay card to another credit card. However, Mr B says that instead of 
transferring to his credit card the transfer went to his wifes credit card. He says this has 
happened previously as the last four digits on the cards are the same. Mr B wants NewDay 
to return the money back to his account along with any charges or deductions associated 
with the transfer.
NewDay issued a final response letter dated 13 March 2023. It said that Mr B completed a 
standard balance transfer of £6,000 and was advised of the terms and conditions which he 
would have agreed to before completing the transfer. It said it was unable to reverse the 
transaction to his wifes card and couldnt at that time increase Mr Bs credit limit. Therefore, 
it rejected this part of Mr Bs complaint.
NewDay said at that time it had been unable to identify the exact details Mr B entered online 
and couldnt say why it had passed the security check but said this might have been an 
issue with its third-party provider. It accepted that the card the funds were transferred to 
belonged to Mr Bs wife and that he had a poor experience. Because of this it upheld this 
part of his complaint and credited his account with £45.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response and referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator initially didnt uphold this complaint but then issued a second view saying 
that while the system notes confirmed that Mr B had entered his wifes credit card details 
when applying for the balance transfer, NewDay could have done more to assist him when 
he contacted it about the issue. Because of this she recommended that NewDay pay Mr B 
£150 compensation.
Mr B didnt accept our investigators view. He said the outcome failed to address the 
financial impact he had suffered by NewDay not stopping the transfer and said that he had 
explained that his wifes credit card provider had refused to return the money. He said that 
NewDay could have recalled his money and it was punishing him by not doing this even 
though the mistake was not only his but NewDays as well. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am sorry to hear of the upset caused to Mr B by his balance transfer being applied to his 
wifes credit card rather than his. But for me to uphold this complaint I need to be satisfied 
that NewDay did something wrong or treated Mr B unfairly.
Mr B completed an online balance transfer. He entered the credit card details and having 
looked at the information provided; it appears that the details entered were those of Mr Bs 
wifes card rather than his card. Mr B has confirmed that the transfer went to his wifes card. 
As NewDay carried out the balance transfer to the card specified by Mr B I cannot say it did 
anything wrong in regard to this part of the process.
NewDay has explained that before a balance transfer is completed it uses a credit reference 
agency to verify the customers identity and to check the card the customer wishes to 
transfer a balance to or from belongs to them. In this case, the transfer happened from 
Mr Bs card to his wifes card and so I understand why Mr B believes the transfer should 
have been declined.
NewDay has explained that it uses a third-party to undertake its verification checks. It said 
the checks are risk-based using a number of components. I accept that it cannot provide 
further details of the checks. I have looked at the online servicing activity for 12 January and 
can see that Mr Bs application for the balance transfer was approved. Therefore, it appears 
that the verification checks were successful, and, on this basis, I do not find I can say that 
NewDay was wrong to carry out the transfer in line with Mr Bs instructions.
However, when Mr B became aware of the mistake, he contacted NewDay and at this point I 
think it could have done more to assist him. I appreciate that as the transfer had been 
processed by the time Mr B alerted NewDay to the issue, this couldnt then be stopped. But 
NewDay could have attempted to recall the funds. I note the comments NewDay has made 
about it not being required to do this and that it had confirmed the issue arose due to Mr B 
inputting incorrect details rather than a mistake made by NewDay. I also note the comment 
that there could be a cost associated with requesting the recall. However, given Mr B alerted 
NewDay to the issue on 16 January 2023 and that as part of the online journey Mr B had 
been told a transfer would only happen to an account in his name and this turned out not to 
be true, I think NewDay should have requested the recall in an attempt to resolve the issue.
I accept that the recall may not have been successful, and I do not find that because the 
recall wasnt requested that NewDay should refund Mr B the transferred funds. I note Mr Bs 
comment that his wifes card provider has said it wont return the money but as it is Mr Bs 
wife that has the benefit of the money (rather than a separate third party) it isnt 
unreasonable to say that he should be able to find a way to resolve this issue. 
Based on the above, I do no not require NewDay to do anything further in regard to the 
balance transfer, but I do think it should pay Mr B compensation for not providing the service 
it should have when he asked for help. This issue has caused Mr B stress and he has spent 
time trying to resolve it and had NewDay requested the recall (as it had on a previous 
occasion) this may have been avoided, or at least reduced. Given this I think the £150 
recommended by our investigator is reasonable. I know that Mr B doesnt think the £150 is 
enough, but for the reasons set out above I find this a reasonable resolution to the issues 
raised.
Putting things right
NewDay Ltd should pay Mr B £150 compensation for not providing the service it should have 
when Mr B contacted it about the error with his balance transfer.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Pulse should take the action set out above in 
resolution of this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2023.
