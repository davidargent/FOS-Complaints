The complaint
Ms S (through a representative) complains Short Term Finance Limited (STF) lent to her

indebtedness.   
  
What happened
In total Ms S was given 38 home collected loans between February 2014 and February 
2020. Ive included some of the information this Service has received from STF about the 
lending in the table below;

In response to Ms Ss complaint STF issued its final response letter in February 2021. In the 
response it explained that Ms S had taken a total of 38 loans between 2014 and 2020. STF 
didnt uphold Ms Ss complaint. Unhappy with this response, Ms Ss representatives referred 
her complaint to this Service.   
The adjudicator, reviewed Ms Ss complaint and she thought STF had acted reasonably 
when it approved loans 1  5. But, the adjudicator thought, that from and including loan 6 all 
future loans shouldnt have been granted. In her view, the overall pattern of lending was now 
harmful for Ms S and so these loans ought to not have been provided. 
Ms S appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, it said;
there was no nothing wrong in the way STF dealt with Ms S;
it adhered to all the regulations that were applicable at the time and
it was only from November 2018 that STF had the ability for the agents to keep any 
evidence they gathered as part of the application process, for example bank 
statements. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached about loans 1  5. So, I no longer think they are in dispute and so I wont be making 
a finding on them. Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 6  38 
were lent. But Ive kept in mind loan 1- 5 as they do form part of Ms Ss lending history with 
STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms S could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms S. These factors include: 
Ms S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms S. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time loan 1 was granted STF was regulated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). And 
at the time loans 2  38 were given, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them  the 
OFT also said something similar. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Ss complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 38 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
But its worth saying STF has provided this Service with the income and expenditure 
information which it gathered for Ms S for loans 2  38. For the later loans further, more 
detailed information appears to have been gathered. 
This seems to be in response to the change in process and new system that STF had in 
place from November 2018. I can see that on these reports, there is reference to credit 
reports. So, it appears that the figure for certain expenditure categories STF was able to 
confirm the information from Ms Ss credit report, for example, loan 38, for other home credit 
STF has recorded the figure as £144.92.
I would say, that based on the details in the application form and the later income and 
expenditure assessments, that STF couldve reasonably concluded that Ms S would be in a 
position to afford the repayments she was committed to making. 
But Id be inclined to think that from loan 6, STFs checks really needed to go further. At this 
point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been verifying Ms Ss income and 
overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial 
position. I dont think it did this level of checks for all of Ms Ss loans. That isnt the end of the matter, on top of carrying out a proportionate STF also need to be 
mindful whether the loans were sustainable for Ms S, not just whether the loans were 
pounds and pence affordable. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms S, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms S. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Ms S, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided 
loan 6. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms S was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms S had taken out six loans in 19 months and she had been indebted 
to STF for almost the entire time. There isnt an insignificant period of time to be 
borrowing high cost credit. Ms Ss loan history up until this point clearly indicated that 
her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving, given her loans were 
increasing in value. 
Ms Ss capital borrowing had increased from £250 to £350. This suggests to me that 
Ms Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably, and she was likely needing 
further borrowing to cover ongoing living costs. 
Its also worth noting that for all loans up to this point in time, Ms S declared she 
needed the loans for subsistence, so she was using these loans to support an 
ongoing short fall in her living costs rather than for example to support a one off 
purchase.   
Ms S developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous ones 
were repaid, for example, loans 4 and 5. And later on in the lending relationship Ms S 
had more than one loan running at the same time. This pattern continued throughout 
the lending relationship. So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Ms S, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-
term financial need. To me, this is also indicative of her indebtedness not being 
sustainable.
Ms S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loans 37 and 38 
were taken out six years after Ms Ss first loan. And loans 37 and 38 were for nearly 
seven times the amount of Ms Ss first loan. Ms S had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Ms S lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 38 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 38 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms S from loan 6 as I think it ought to.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.For example, having been declined this lending Ms S may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms S in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms S would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms S loans 6 - 38.
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms S towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms S originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should pay Ms S A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Ms Ss borrowing for loans 6 - 38 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from 
Ms Ss credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms S a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Ss complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2022.
