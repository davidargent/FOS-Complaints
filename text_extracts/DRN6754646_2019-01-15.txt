K820x#14complaint
Mrs G complains that NewDay  Ltd (NewDay) recorded a default  on her credit  file without 
advising her or giving her the opportunity to pay the outstanding debt.
background
Mrs G took out an Aqua  credit card, administered by NewDay, in September 2014 with a 
£250 credit  limit. Statements  show that the account limit was exceeded in the first month  but 
Mrs G didnt make any payments towards the balance on the card until February 2015 when 
she made one payment,  which  was reversed, of £132.92. Nothing further has been paid.
NewDay has shown it sent a number of letters about non-payment to Mrs G and issued a 
default notice  in January 2015. It says it didnt hear from her at all during this time and so it 
sold the debt to a third party in October 2016. NewDay  says it wont  amend  the adverse data 
that has been recorded on Mrs Gs credit  file as its required to accurately reflect her credit  
activity which it says it has done.  
Mrs G said NewDay  knew her address yet didnt make her aware  of the situation  or allow  her 
to pay the outstanding amount. She thinks thatapart  from the default thats been 
registered, NewDay might  have recorded  a county court judgement (CCJ)  against  her which  
she says is making it difficult to get any credit.  
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said it shouldnt be upheld. She noted 
that Mrs G didnt make any payments on her card for five months after she took it out. And 
as Mrs G failed to notify NewDay of her change of address the adjudicator  thought NewDay 
had accurately recorded her credit activity and couldnt have done  anymore.
Mrs G disagreed. She said any correspondence  sent to her previous address would have 
been returned as the new owners knew she no longer lived there. And she says this 
shouldve prompted  NewDay to contact her by other  means. As she disagreed the case has 
been passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs G has raised  complaints with us against three different lenders about similar issues.  For 
clarity Im only considering this one against  NewDay here. 
I can see Mrs G feels  strongly about whats happened and I have some sympathy for her 
position as shes  finding it difficult to obtain  new credit. So I can assure  her Ive considered 
what shes said very carefully, but I dont think NewDay has done anything wrong and Ill 
explain why.
Ive seen the letters and statements that NewDay  sent Mrs G after she took out the credit  
card. She didnt  make any payments for five months  and in that time I can see NewDay  kept 
her up to date with the position of the account and confirmed  how she could pay back  the 
arrears or how to contact  it and discuss the situation. Ive also seen  how NewDay sent these 
letters to the address it held for Mrs G from when her agreement was first made. So overall I 
Ref: DRN67546462think NewDay did keep in touch with Mrs G and kept her informed about the account to the 
only address it was aware of. I dont think it should  have  done anymore at that time. 
Mrs G said she didnt receive  any letters from NewDay to make  her aware of the arrears on 
her account  or that a default would be recorded on her credit file. She says this is unfair  as 
she hasnt had the chance  to do anything about it. But theres no evidence that Mrs G made 
NewDay aware that she changed  address and I can see shes given us two subsequent  
addresses which followed the one NewDay held. So I cant say NewDay didnt anything 
wrong by sending correspondence to the address it held. I note it sent its final complaint 
response to the same  address  . And Mrs G told us she had destroyed  the response  which  
would suggest  that she did receive  that letter.
I think it was Mrs Gs responsibility  to make NewDay aware that shed changed address and 
I dont think NewDay could be expected to send  information anywhere  but the last address it 
held for her. Mrs G hasnt  disputed that she didnt  tell NewDay shed  moved address. But 
she says that any letter  sent to her, at that previous address, would  have been  returned to 
the sender and that NewDay shouldve contacted her by other  means i.e. email/phone.
But I dont think I can safely say that the new resident  wouldve returned  mail belonging to 
Mrs G. And if they didnt, I cant say that wouldve been NewDays  fault. But I have looked at 
NewDays records to see what this shows happened. 
NewDay has already  told us that a letter from July 2018 was returned to it and I can see that 
this is recorded  on its records.  But this was after the events complained about. Given  this 
returned item was recorded on its records, I think its most likely that if any earlier mail had 
been returned this would  be recorded  in its records too. But I cant  find any record of 
previous mail being returned. So I dont think NewDay wouldve had any reason to think     
Mrs G wasnt  receiving the statements  and letters it sent to her. And therefore it had no 
reason to contact  her by any other means. And indeed there was no obligation  upon  
NewDay to do so. 
Ive also have to take into account  that Mrs G hasnt disputed using her card for transactions. 
And I can see she made a payment to her account  - which was later reversed - following the 
February 2015 statement, which said there  were  arrears of £132.92 and the card would  be 
stopped if she didnt pay. So overall I think its reasonable  to conclude that Mrs G wouldve 
been aware that she had debt outstanding with NewDay that she needed to repay. Yet there  
is nothing to suggest Mrs G contacted  NewDay to discuss the debt she owed.  And  as she 
cancelled the payment  she did make  and didnt make any further payments, I think its fair to 
say that she ought  to have understood that the position of the account was likely to worsen. 
And I would have expected her to have  contacted  NewDay at that time if she had any 
worries about repaying the debt and wanted  to maintain her credit  file.
I note the credit card agreement, which contained Mrs Gs original address, stated missing  
payments could have  severe consequences including making credit more  difficult  to obtain. 
We may take legal  action  against you if payments are not made. So I think Mrs G had been 
made aware  of the consequences of not making  payments and I think  NewDay  has acted 
correctly in applying  the default in 2015. And it had a duty to correctly and accurately reflect 
the position of Mrs Gs account with the credit  reference agencies.
Mrs G has suggested that NewDay recorded  a CCJ against her. But she hasnt provided any 
evidence of this. NewDay has told us that although  the debt was subsequently sold to a third 
Ref: DRN67546463party, it hasnt obtained a CCJ, and I havent  seen anything in its records to suggest  it has.  
In the absence of any other evidence, I think its unlikely that NewDay has recorded a CCJ 
on Mrs Gs credit file.
So overall, having thought  about  this carefully,  I dont think  NewDay has treated Mrs G 
unfairly. So I wont be asking it to take any further  action with this complaint, 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint against NewDay Ltd.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2019.
