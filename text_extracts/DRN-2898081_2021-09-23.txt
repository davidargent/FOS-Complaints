The complaint
Mr L complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly stopped him from accessing funds
he held in a business account. He says this prevented him from fulfilling customer orders,
which caused him significant financial and reputational loss. He wants PayPal to refund the
funds it froze and pay him a large sum in compensation.
What happened
Mr L holds a business account with PayPal. He opened it in 2009 but the account lay
dormant until the middle of 2019 when it began to be used.
PayPal placed a block on the account in April 2020, but numerous payments from Mr Ls
customers still credited the account. PayPal asked Mr L for several pieces of information,
which Mr L provided. It then decided to permanently restrict Mr Ls access to the account. It
told him it was discontinuing its relationship with him as a customer due to risk. And it
decided to hold the funds in the account for 180 days.
After the restriction Mr L stopped sending out goods for orders placed shortly before the
restriction. And during the 180 days, claims came in from Mr Ls customers for non-receipt of
goods. PayPal returned the payments back to the customers, leaving the account with a
negative balance which PayPal say Mr L owes.
Mr L complained to PayPal, who rejected his complaint. It said it made a legitimate
commercial decision and Mr L needed to pay what he owed it.
An investigator at our service decided not to uphold Mr Ls complaint. They found PayPal
was entitled to block Mr Ls account and reverse the payments in line with its legal and
regulatory obligations.
Mr L disagreed and said the investigator ignored most of the points he made in a particulars
of claim document he sent to our service. He asked for an ombudsman to make a final
decision and he provided further evidence to support the extent of his loss. The complaint
was passed to me in my capacity as an ombudsman to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in August 2021. My findings were:
Mr L referred to various parts of the EU payment services directive (Directive (EU) 
2015/2366). EU directives are not directly applicable to EU member states or PayPal. 
Instead they need to be implemented by EU member states through their own 
national laws. PayPal is based in Luxembourg, so the relevant national law would be 
the legislation Luxembourg implemented to give the directive effect.
Mr L has referred to provisions in the directive regarding PayPals framework 
contract the framework contract being PayPals user agreement which governed 
his and PayPals relationship. He has asked for proof of delivery of the framework 
contract and its iterations over the years his account existed. He wants some of this 
information to present at court.
Our service, however, is set up as a free alternative to the court. We are not here to 
obtain information to assist Mr L in bringing a future claim. Instead, my role as an
ombudsman is to consider all the information available to me to reach a decision on
Mr Ls complaint.
I havent seen evidence to show PayPal failed to notify Mr L of changes made to the
user agreement throughout the duration of his account being open. And I am 
satisfied I have considered the appropriate terms of the user agreement when
provisionally deciding this complaint.
Mr L has asked for an explanation on why his communication with PayPal was 
deleted. But I dont find PayPal deleted this information for improper reasons. I am 
satisfied I have seen all the relevant communications Mr L had with PayPal. And Mr L 
copied his communications with PayPal before they were deleted, so I dont find their 
deletion caused him actual loss.
Mr L has referred to PayPal not informing him about alternative dispute resolution. 
But Mr L was aware of our service and referred his complaint to us. So, I am not 
awarding him compensation in the event PayPal should have referred him to our 
service earlier than it did. I also find our service is clearly referred to in PayPals user 
agreement which is accessible online.
Mr L wants to also get compensation for customers who didnt receive goods as a 
result of the account being blocked. But under the dispute resolution rules, which 
govern our services jurisdiction, Mr L is the eligible complainant and not anyone 
else. So, losses suffered by persons other than him are not something I can fairly 
consider, except in relation to the impact they might have had on him.
Mr L says PayPal made false statements about money being received to at least one 
of his customers. But I dont find the statement to be false. PayPal held the 
payment(s) but didnt release the funds to him.
The main brunt of Mr Ls complaint is he doesnt think PayPal could take the action it 
did. But I find PayPals actions were reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. It has extensive legal and regulatory obligations which were not only 
limited to Mr L or the terms of its user agreement.
I have carefully considered the numerous emails Mr L received from unhappy 
customers, and the information he provided in relation to customers he says received 
their orders who PayPal refunded. And I acknowledge he may have suffered some 
reputational and financial loss as a result of his account being restricted. But this 
doesnt mean PayPal was wrong to prevent him accessing the funds or to return 
payments to his customers.
PayPal can, when appropriate, prevent customers accessing funds in their accounts 
to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations, many of which concern preventing 
financial harm to customers and other persons. Restricting access to an account for 
these reasons is common practice and a freezing order from a court isnt needed. 
PayPal could risk serious sanction or fines if it didnt sometimes act.
PayPal received quite a lot of claims from Mr Ls customers prior to his account being 
blocked. So, its understandable why it might have wanted to review what was 
happening. Mr Ls account had also been open for a considerable time before becoming very active, which was unusual. So, I find PayPal acted reasonably by 
initially restricting the account to conduct a review.
And, after considering all the available information and evidence, I understand why
PayPal chose to permanently stop Mr L using the account, why it deemed the
account a risk, and why it decided to hold the funds in the account for a set period to
meet potential customer claims. I find its decision was legitimate and not made in bad
faith.
Mr L couldnt fulfill orders when his account was restricted because he couldnt use 
the funds in his account. The reason for this is because, as far as I understand, he 
operated a drop shipment business model. This meant he didnt manufacture or hold 
stock himself. Instead, he used a third-party supplier based abroad who would send 
goods to his customers on receiving payment from him.
Mr L says PayPal shouldnt have continued to accept orders when his access was 
restricted. But until PayPal had completed its review, I dont see the onus was on it to 
stop accepting payments from Mr Ls customers.
PayPal justifiably wanted to review the account, request information and then review
that information. It could not have known at that time what decision it would
eventually reach or how long the account would be restricted. It wasnt responsible
for the business model Mr L chose to operate and the risks that come with it if funds
are restricted. And it didnt need to forgo its responsibilities because Mr L couldnt
fulfil customer orders without having access to the funds.
Mr L was told incorrect information by a PayPal employee over PayPals online 
messaging function. The employee wrote Mr L would have access to the funds after 
the review completed, which this was wrong as they could not have known that at the 
time. But Mr L decided not to continue advertising his products that same day, and I 
dont find PayPals decision to hold on to the funds was wrong. So, I am not awarding 
compensation to Mr L because of its employees error.
Im satisfied PayPals decision to reverse many of the payments when customer 
claims arose was reasonable. I say this because of the numerous claims it received 
from customers prior to the account restriction and the other information it also 
considered. Mr L may feel some customers have been unfairly enriched, but I am not 
holding PayPal liable for those losses. Mr Ls account now carries a negative balance 
as a result of the claims, and I find PayPal can fairly ask him to repay what he owes.
Mr L says PayPal needed to give him at least two months notice before the account 
closed. But while Mr L cant use the account, which is almost equivalent to not having 
the account at all, the account does still exist. However, even if Mr Ls account was 
closed by PayPal giving him two months notice, Im satisfied PayPal would still have 
acted reasonably by retaining the funds after closure to meet potential customer 
claims.
Mr L disagrees with my provisional findings: In summary, he said
The EU Payment Services Directive is directly relevant, and PayPal must follow it. 
The number of customer claims in relation to his account wasnt enough to restrict it. 
The claims arose due to the shortage of the product he was supplying, and customer 
anxiety during a difficult time.
PayPal purposefully continued accepting payments when his access was restricted  
this was premeditated to make his company look fraudulent. It knew about his business model he and should have gathered the information it needed to make a 
decision sooner.
PayPal could terminate his account but only on giving 60 days notice and allowing 
him to use the account until it closed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have considered carefully what Mr L has said, but I have decided not to uphold the 
complaint for the same reasons I gave in my provisional decision which are repeated above 
and which form part of this decision. I will now address the points Mr L made following my 
provisional decision.
Mr L says I must have regard to relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, 
guidance and standards; codes of practice; and where appropriate what I consider to 
have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
I am aware of my responsibilities under the dispute resolution rules and I have acted 
in accordance with them in reaching my decision.
PayPal is regulated in Luxembourg. It previously passported services into the United 
Kingdom under a services passport. A services passport differed to an establishment 
passport and meant PayPal fell under the authority of the Luxembourg regulator, as 
opposed to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom.
PayPal is currently providing its services to customers in the UK under the temporary 
permissions regime. Its still under the authority of the Luxembourg regulator. But the 
reason our service can consider a complaint about PayPal is because it is a member 
of our voluntary jurisdiction. Along with other things, falling under our voluntary 
jurisdiction means our service can consider a non-UK firm providing services outside 
the UK.
European directives need to be implemented by individual EU member states. Unlike 
EU regulations and treaties, they are not directly applicable. In this case, 
Luxembourg needed to implement the directive by giving it effect through its own 
laws. This is the same as the United Kingdom giving effect to the directive under the 
Payment Services Regulations 2017. If a claimant thought a member state failed to 
implement a directive properly, the claim would be against the individual member 
state and not an individual firm.
The above, however, does not impact my consideration of Mr Ls complaint. The 
effect of the EU directive is implemented by the law in Luxembourg. And I previously 
did consider the points he made in reference to the provisions of the directive. But 
there are other things I need to consider.
PayPal has other important obligations in addition to its responsibility to Mr L and 
Luxembourg law. And sometimes those other obligations override its general duty to 
follow a customers mandate.  I dont find PayPals actions unusual in choosing to 
restrict Mr Ls account. Im satisfied, based on my experience as an ombudsman, 
that firms reviewing accounts and restricting access to them during a review is not 
uncommon.
Mr L says I need to refer to specific legislation. But PayPals responsibilities are 
numerous, and many relate to where possible preventing financial harm. So, in summary, PayPal needs to monitor accounts and take reasonable action to prevent 
financial harm. If PayPal didnt act when it should, it could risk serious consequences 
and incur liability.
I find the number of disputes raised with PayPal about Mr Ls account before it was 
restricted is relevant. While there were 15 open claims at the time the account was 
restricted, there had been more than 30 total claims raised by Mr Ls customers prior 
to his access being removed, which generally regarded items not being received and 
customers being unable to get a response from Mr L. The number of claims is to my 
mind significant, as is the theme of what Mr Ls customers were complaining about. 
So, I disagree with him that this shouldnt have been a concern for PayPal.
Mr Ls account had also been dormant for a long time before any activity occurred. 
This is unusual and would have been enough reason for PayPal to review the 
account and restrict access to it to while it did. PayPal would understandably want to 
know why there was a sudden spike in transactions, and to ask for information about 
them given the claims it received from his customers. I dont find it needed to ask for 
this information when the account opened. Its responsibilities to prevent financial 
harm and to monitor accounts are ongoing.
The products Mr L advertised could have helped customers at a time of global need. 
But I dont find this meant PayPal needed to forgo its responsibilities because of the 
benefit the products could have had and because Mr L was prevented from sending 
the products because he needed to pay for stock to send out.
The consequence of the permanent restriction was Mr L could not pay his supplier to 
fulfill orders placed shortly before and after his account was blocked. Its true the 
business model Mr L used may be widespread, but the risk that comes from needing 
to pay a supplier for orders to be dispatched is something he had to bear. And Im 
satisfied PayPal should not be held responsible for the losses he incurred because I 
find its decision to review the account was reasonable. 
Mr L was ultimately responsible for whether to continue to accept new orders or not. I 
dont find PayPal would have known what its decision would have been when it first 
restricted Mr Ls access. So, I dont find it should have refused further payments 
during its review. After all, if after completing its review, PayPal had decided to un-
restrict the account, Mr L could have made payments to his supplier and potentially 
fulfilled his orders.
PayPal placed a permanent restriction on Mr L using the account, which it was 
permitted to do. I dont find it was only allowed to give Mr L notice to close the 
account and allow him full use of the account for 60 days before it closed. I 
understand why PayPal was concerned about future customer claims, and that those 
claims might be jeopardized if it allowed Mr L to withdraw funds. I find its decision 
was reasonable in these circumstances.
My final decisionI have decided to not uphold Mr Ls complaint for the reasons I have given above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2021.
