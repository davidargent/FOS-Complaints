K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  removed money  from his 
current account, without  his permission, in order to apply those funds to a NatWest credit 
card debt.
background
The adjudicators background summary  covered all the relevant facts  and is known to both 
Mr S and NatWest so I wont repeat it in any great detail. Therefore,  if Ive not mentioned  
something its not because Ive ignored it, but because I dont think  its relevant  to the issues. 
However in summary  it is this; 
Mr S obtained a credit card with NatWest in 2002. In 2004  he agreed to repay  his debt on 
the card at the rate of £5 per month and made payments to an organisation called OSCC Ltd 
whom he believed NatWest had sold the debt to. OSCC Ltd was dissolved in June 2013 but 
payments continued  to be made  from Mr Ss NatWest  bank  account  thereafter until April 
2017 when the last one was returned. Mr Ss credit card account  however shows  that the 
monthly £5 credits were only applied to the credit card account up to and including 
November 2016.  So Mr S naturally wants to know what  happened to those £5 credits after 
November 2016.
NatWest say that Mr Ss credit card account has been with their various  external agents  
since 2004. Those agents were (and in this order); 'Intrum  Justitia' 2004-2012; Experto 
Credite 2012-2016; Wescot Credit Services 2016-Feb 2017; Moorcroft Debt  Recovery 
Feb 2017- July 2017; APEX Credit Management July 2017-January  2018, and ZINC 
January 2018  onwards. 
NatWest said they had no knowledge of OSCC  Ltd and confirmed that the debt was never  
sold to anyone. They also said that because  no payments had been made to the account 
since November 2016, they wrote to Mr S in May 2018 explaining that they might apply their 
legal right of set off (ROSO) to transfer some money from his NatWest bank account to pay 
some of the credit card debt. And in May, NatWest did that by taking £1,591.83 out of his 
NatWest bank account. 
Mr S complained to NatWest asking that they return the £1,591.83 to him. He also asked 
where his payments had gone  to after November 2016. NatWest  looked into his complaint 
but didnt think  they had done anything wrong. 
Mr S was unhappy with NatWests response and so the adjudicator looked into the complaint 
but didnt think  NatWest had acted unfairly. As Mr S didnt agree, the complaint has been  
passed to me for a final decision. 
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional findings on this complaint on the 11 March 2020  which  were thus;
I think there are two issues here. First there  is the issue of what happened to the £5 
payments taken from Mr Ss bank  account after November 2016,  and secondly  whether it 
was fair that NatWest  took £1,591.83 by way of ROSO from his bank account.
Ref: DRN19662972Dealing with the last point first. Section  7.10 of the terms  and conditions  on Mr Ss current 
account do allow NatWest  to take funds  from his account where a debt is payable  to them. In 
fact NatWest gave notice of this to Mr S on the 3 May 2018. And when NatWest took the 
money from his account it left him with a balance of £888.68, and so I cant say NatWest  has 
acted unfairly as it stuck  to the terms and conditions  and didnt  leave his account without a 
reasonable amount of funds in it.
Turning to the other issue, Mr Ss bank statements do show  he has been paying  £5 per 
month as he says to OSCC Ltd. Ive seen a letter dated 21 February 2017 from OSCC Ltd 
(albeit it is signed off Intrum Justitia Ltd) that Mr S had a debit  balance  of £4,796.83 with 
NatWest. Ive also seen  a letter dated  23 February  2017 from OSCC Ltd. Both letters prove 
that NatWest must have  instructed  OSCC  to act as their agent, because the letter of the 
21 February 2017 has Mr Ss credit  card account  number  on, and although the letter  of the 
23 February 2017 doesnt have the account  number on, it has the same  balance as the 
earlier letter,  and so on a balance of probabilities both letters refer to the same debt. I have 
also seen Mr Ss payment  book  which has a reference number 212415466P and that 
number appears  on both of the above letters. I therefore find that NatWest must be mistaken 
when they say they have  not instructed OSCC Ltd.
That being  the case it is clear that the payments Mr S made  in December 2016, 
January 2017,  February 2017  and March 2017 were  on a balance of probabilities  payments  
made towards his credit card debt. I accept  that OSCC Ltd went  into administration  in 2013 
but the bank account shows payments were being made under that reference  and they were  
being applied  to the credit  card account  up to November 2016.  It must follow  that NatWest  
will know  where those payments went and to whom they were paid.
my provisional decision
My provisional decision was that I didnt think that NatWest acted unfairly  by removing 
£1,591.83 from Mr Ss bank account. I did however feel that Mr S had not been  treated fairly 
regarding the payments  he made  to his credit card debt, after November 2016. I thought 
NatWest should  repay  those payments  Mr S made  after November 2016  and also pay him 
£100 in compensation to reflect the distress  and inconvenience caused.
responses my provisional decision
Mr S responded to my provisional decision.  The salient part of his response appears  to me 
to be this; He had been making payments to his credit card debt as advised, and then whilst 
abroad the £1,591.83 was removed from his account. The reason for that he believes is 
because of a mistake by NatWest and its agent.  He feels that the compensation ought to be 
that NatWest return the money it took and remove the interest and account  fees he incurred 
because he went into overdraft from May 2016  until he recently managed to put his account 
back in credit. He also feels he should  receive  £53.47 in respect of the cost of telephone 
calls he made  when  abroad in an attempt to sort the matter out. 
NatWest asked for further time to respond to my provisional decision and were  granted  an 
extension to the 17 April 2020. Nothing  further  has been received.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  The role of the Financial Ombudsman 
Ref: DRN19662973Service is to resolve individual complaints and to award redress  where  it is appropriate so to 
do. 
What I need to decide is whether NatWest  acted fairly and reasonably  in its dealings with 
Mr S. I take into account both NatWests view and that of Mr S. The aim of my decision is to 
reach a fair and reasonable decision based  on the facts of the case.
Where the evidence is incomplete,  inconclusive or contradictory, I am bound to reach  a 
decision on the balance  of probabilities  in other words, I consider  what  is more likely  to 
have happened  in the light of that evidence and the wider circumstances of the case. 
Looking at the available evidence, I think we have an unfortunate situation here. 
I adopt my provisional findings and shall not repeat  them  as they are set out above. Mr S 
has challenged my view but I do not think it requires change.  The reason for that is that 
although Mr S was in a payment arrangement with NatWest and its agent, NatWest  were 
entitled under the terms and conditions to apply their ROSO and remove  the funds as they 
did from Mr Ss account. Notice was given of that action, and although it appears Mr S was 
abroad at the time, NatWest nevertheless acted within the terms and conditions.  So I cant  
say they have acted unfairly.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly by removing  £1,591.83 from 
Mr Ss bank  account. 
I do however feel Mr S has not been  treated fairly regarding the payments he made to his 
credit card debt, after November 2016. NatWest must repay  all those payments Mr S made 
after November 2016 and in addition pay him £100  by way of compensation to reflect  the 
distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20  May 2020.
