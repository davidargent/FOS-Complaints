The complaint
Miss D complains about two loans provided to her by Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 
118 118 Money, (118 118 Money), which she says were unaffordable. 
What happened
118 118 Money agreed two loans for Miss D. Loan 1 was for £2,000 and taken out in 
September 2020. Loan 2 was for £4,286.48 and taken out in August 2021. Loan 2 was used 
to repay Loan 1, but it appears that Loan 2 hasnt been repaid and has been sold to a third 
party (T). Some of the information 118 118 Money provided about the loans is shown in the 
table below.

2. 5/8/2021 Unpaid £4,286.48 £141.16 60
Miss D says that 118 118 Money should never have given her these unaffordable loans. And 
if 118 118 Money had made the appropriate checks prior to issuing her with the loans, it 
would have seen that she had a high-cost car finance loan repayment, she had maxed out 
two credit cards and store credit and had taken out another loan in May 2020. A credit check 
would have shown that her finance had got worse since Loan 1. 118 118 Money didnt ask if 
her income or expenses had changed when she applied for Loan 2. 
Our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that Miss Ds complaint should be upheld. He said that 
the lender shouldve taken steps to build a more detailed picture of her financial situation. 
The adjudicator had looked at the information Miss D had sent to us and considered whether 
118 118 Money wouldve done anything differently had it seen this information before 
lending to her. But based on this information, he hadnt seen anything which suggested that  
the lender wouldve concluded that Miss D wouldnt have been able to have sustainably 
repaid these loans.
Miss D disagreed and responded to the adjudicators view by saying that 118 118 Money 
didnt act responsibly, and it had given her a loan that she couldnt afford in the long run. At 
the time Loan 2 was issued, she was unemployed and on benefits. In July 2021, she had to 
take out a loan of £1,300 to survive and pay her bills as she had lost her job. 118 118 Money 
didnt ask if her income and expenses had changed. It also didnt ask for proof of bank 
statements to check if the new repayments were affordable. She struggled to repay Loan 1 
and she couldnt keep up with the repayments on Loan 2.
As this complaint hadnt been resolved informally, it was passed to me, as an ombudsman, 
to review and resolve. 
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss D
and to 118 118 Money on 1 September 2022. I summarise my findings:
I noted that when 118 118 Money lent to Miss D the regulator was the Financial Conduct 
Authority and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook. 
I said that 118 118 Money would be aware of the relevant regulations and how we 
considered irresponsible lending complaints, so I wouldnt go into detail on these points. 
Id thought about whether 118 118 Money completed reasonable and proportionate checks 
when assessing Miss Ds applications to satisfy itself that she would be able to make her 
repayments without experiencing adverse consequences. Id thought about the information it 
knew, and what it ought reasonably to have known.
Loan 1
Loan 1 was for £2,000. The interest rate was 37.7%, (44.9% APR). If Miss D made each
payment when it was due, shed pay £2,666.34 in total. Loan 1 was repaid in August 2021.
Id noted that 118 118 Money had gathered some information from Miss D about her income 
and expenditure. It had also carried out a credit check.
Miss D had told 118 118 Money her monthly income was £1,918. Her rent was around £342, 
and her living costs were around £539. 118 118 Money said it assessed Miss Ds credit 
expenditure from her credit file and it said her monthly credit commitments were £491. 
Id reviewed 118 118 Moneys credit checks. Id noted that these showed that Miss D had ten 
active credit accounts and her total credit balance was around £18,000. I thought the results 
of 118 118 Moneys credit checks ought to have caused it some concerns as Miss D had 
taken out a loan of around £4,235 just four months earlier. I could also see that around the 
same time Miss D had repaid £1,850 to two credit cards. At the very least I would have 
reasonably expected 118 118 Money to have taken steps to verify Miss Ds income and 
actual monthly expenditure to gain a more thorough understanding of her financial position in 
order to satisfy itself that she could repay the loan without Miss D having to borrow again. 
118 118 Money didnt say that it took steps to do this.
118 118 Moneys affordability assessment wasnt tailored to Miss D and I thought it should 
have been in her circumstances. Miss D was entering into a significant commitment with   
118 118 Money. She would need to make monthly repayments of around £148 for 18 
months. Given the length of time Miss D was committing to repay the credit and what       
118 118 Money would have likely seen on its credit checks, I didnt think its checks were 
sufficient for 118 118 Money to get a clear picture of Miss Ds finances at the time. 
118 118 Money needed to do more than just ascertain whether the loan repayments were 
technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. It could have done this by, 
for example, requesting bank statements from Miss D, asking for copies of bills and/or 
receipts for her expenses. I couldnt see that 118 118 Money had taken steps to do this. 
But although I thought 118 118 Money should have asked for some additional information 
before agreeing the loan, that in itself didnt mean that Miss Ds complaint should succeed. I 
also needed to be persuaded that any further information would have shown 118 118 Money 
that Miss D couldn't repay the loan without the repayments having a significant adverse 
impact on her financial situation. Miss D had provided this Service with her bank statements from around the time of Loan 1. 
Id reviewed these to give me the best picture of what the lender should have seen, although 
I wasnt suggesting that these were the checks that 118 118 Money should have done. 
Id noted that Miss Ds income was less than shed declared to 118 118 Money and the living 
costs and credit commitments on the bank statements were higher than the amounts the 
lender provided to this Service. The account didnt go overdrawn and I could see that Miss D 
received transfers from other accounts when she was near to going overdrawn. Id also 
noted that Miss D was able to save £200 each month. Overall, I didnt think the account was 
showing signs of financial distress. The statements didnt show any apparent issues such as 
significant gambling or short term loans. I didnt think they would have caused                   
118 118 Money serious concerns if the lender had seen them. 
So, from the information Id seen, I didnt think better checks by 118 118 Money would have 
uncovered anything that would have shown that Miss D might have difficulty repaying     
Loan 1. Looking at the statements, there was nothing to suggest to me that Miss D was at 
this stage dependent on credit or that she was having problems managing her finances. 
So, looking at everything in the round, I hadnt seen enough to find that 118 118 Money 
ought to have declined to lend Loan 1 to Miss D and I wasnt persuaded that 118 118 Money 
lent irresponsibly on this occasion.
Loan 2
Loan 2 was for £4,286.48 and 118 118 Money used £1,036.48 from this amount to repay 
Loan 1. The interest rate was 31.1%, (35.9% APR). If Miss D made each payment when it 
was due, shed pay £8,469.60 in total. 
118 118 Money hadnt provided this Service with details of any information it obtained from 
Miss D at the time of her application about her income and expenditure. Id noted that Miss D 
said she wasnt asked to provide updated information. I didnt think it was sufficient for       
118 118 Money to rely on the information Miss D provided almost a year earlier.
I could see that 118 118 Money did carry out a credit check and that Miss Ds total credit 
balance had increased to £24,308. She now had 13 active accounts and had opened two 
new accounts in the six months prior to the credit check. I could see that a mail order 
balance which was £243 at the time of Loan 1 had now increased to £7,878 and had been 
near its credit limit since February 2021. Id also noted that the balance on a credit card of 
£1,733 was near its credit limit. Altogether I thought that the results of 118 118 Moneys 
credit checks ought to have caused it some concerns as they suggested that Miss Ds 
finances were under pressure as shown especially by her significantly increased total credit 
balance and the balances on two accounts being near their respective limits. 
So, I didnt think that the checks 118 118 Money did before Loan 2 were enough, and Ive 
gone on to consider whether further information would more likely than not have shown     
118 118 Money that Miss D would be able to make the loan payments over the loan term 
without adverse consequences.
Miss D had provided her bank statements from around the time of Loan 2 to this Service. 
Ive reviewed Miss Ds bank statements and could see that at the time of Loan 2 she was no 
longer in receipt of the income from the employers Id seen on previous statements, and that 
she was in receipt of Universal Credit which wasnt sufficient to cover her rent, regular living 
costs and credit commitments. So, I didnt think that further checks would have provided the 
assurance 118 118 Money needed. And I thought if 118 118 Money had made better checks 
it ought reasonably to have realised that it was unlikely that Miss D wouldve been able to repay Loan 2 without her having to borrow to meet the repayments, without her failing to 
make any other repayment she had a contractual or statutory duty to make, and without the 
repayments having a significant adverse effect on her financial situation. 
So, I thought 118 118 Money should reasonably have concluded that it made an unfair 
lending decision when it agreed to lend Loan 2 to Miss D. And, subject to any further 
representations by Miss D or 118 118 Money, I intended to uphold Miss Ds complaint in part 
and say that 118 118 Money should put things right as follows.
Putting things right  what 118 118 Money needs to do
I understand that 118 118 Money has sold the outstanding debt on Loan 2 to T. It should 
buy this back if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If 118 118 Money isnt 
able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with T to achieve the results outlined below.
118 118 Money should put things right for Miss D as follows.
- 118 118 Money needs to ensure that Miss D only repays the principal borrowed 
of £4,286.48 on the loan. In other words, she should not pay any interest or 
charges for Loan 2. So, 118 118 Money should remove all interest, fees and 
charges applied to the account from when it was opened.
- Treat any repayments made by Miss D as though they had been repayments of 
the principal on Loan 2.
- If this results in Miss D having made overpayments, then 118 118 Money should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint is settled.
- If an outstanding balance remains then 118 118 Money should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Miss D, bearing in mind its obligation to treat her 
positively and sympathetically in these discussions.
- Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ds credit file as a result of 
the loan.
 *HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest.      
118 118 Money must give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she 
asks for one. 
Miss D responded to the provisional decision to say that she was satisfied with the outcome 
but she couldnt afford to repay 118 118 Money in her current circumstances.
118 118 Money hasnt provided a response to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry
practice at the time.
Given that Miss D is satisfied with the outcome and 118 118 Money has given me nothing 
further to consider, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold this complaint in part and require 118 118 Money 
to take the steps set out above under the heading Putting things right - what 118 118 Money 
needs to do.
As Miss D has told this Service that she cannot afford to repay 118 118 Money, I would 
remind the lender of its obligation to treat Miss D positively and sympathetically in relation to 
her financial difficulties.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, to take the steps set 
out above under the heading Putting things right - what 118 118 Money needs to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
