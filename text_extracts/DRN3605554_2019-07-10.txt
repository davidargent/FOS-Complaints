K821x#15complaint
Ms W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt deal fairly with a claim she made  
when she was unhappy about an event  she had bought tickets  for through PayPal.
background
Ms W bought tickets for an event through PayPal. Unfortunately, she says,  the event  wasnt  
as advertised  both in terms of the content  of what took place, and its suitability for her 
family. She complained to the event promoter and when she wasnt able to get a refund, 
complained to PayPal.
Ms Ws PayPal account was registered to her work email address.  She made her claim 
through PayPals  online  dispute  resolution service,  and PayPal replied to her registered 
email address asking  for more information. When she didnt reply, it closed the claim down.
Ms W says that her work no longer allows PayPal email, so she didnt receive either the 
request for further information  or the notification her claim had been closed. She said there 
was nothing in the online resolution centre, where  she was expecting  to see the outcome  of 
her claim. She complained to PayPal about  its failure to deal with her claim. As she did so 
from another email  address, PayPal wouldnt  discuss the claim with her. Ms W has since  
changed her account  so that her personal email address  is also registered.
PayPal said it handled the claim in accordance with its user agreement and its usual 
processes. When an online dispute  isnt accepted by the seller, it gets escalated and is no 
longer dealt with online   which is why Ms W didnt see anything in the online resolution 
centre. It can only communicate with emails  registered to the account, and it did so without 
getting a response. It cant be held responsible if Ms W doesnt receive emails it has sent or 
hadnt changed the email  address  associated with her account.
Our investigator asked  PayPal if it would re-consider Ms Ws claim if she now provided  the 
information requested,  but it wasnt willing to do so. Our investigator said PayPal had 
followed its user agreement  and procedures and hadnt done  anything  wrong. So Ms W 
asked for an ombudsman to decide  her complaint.
I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
I can see that PayPal  did follow  the terms of its user agreement. It investigated  the 
claim, decided it needed  further information   in the form of a fuller description of 
what had happened  from Ms W accompanied by a statement of truth  and asked 
her for it. It did so via the email address registered to the account  and, when it got no 
reply, it closed the claim.
Thats PayPals process, and it followed it. To that extent it hasnt done anything 
wrong. But my role isnt just to decide whether the usual process was followed; its to 
decide whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
I have no doubt  that Ms W was unable to receive  PayPal  emails on her work 
account. Once she learned  that was the case,  she should have updated her PayPal 
account  and, indeed, shes now done so. But I accept its not something she 
thought to do at the time. She expected her claim to be managed online so hadnt  
thought about whether shed be able to get emails.  PayPals  explained  why she was 
Ref: DRN36055542wrong about that  but I dont think Ms W understood that at the time,  and Im not 
persuaded she could reasonably have been expected to.
So I think Ms W took reasonable steps to pursue her claim, in registering it online,  
checking for updates and then trying  to escalate it online. By the time she learnt  there 
were emails,  it was too late  the claim had been  closed.
As I say, my role is to decide  whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. I 
think Ms W tried her best to make her claim and escalate it. But because of a 
problem with her work emails, which she hadnt  considered until it was too late, her 
claim failed.  Its never actually been  considered,  and I think a fair resolution here 
would be for PayPal to consider it now.
If Ms W accepts my final decision, she should  edit her account to remove the work  
email and ensure  only her personal  email  is associated with the account.  I then 
intend to require PayPal to send  her an email setting  out the further information it 
asked for when the claim was first made and allowing Ms W a reasonable time to 
provide it. If she does so, PayPal should then consider her claim as it would have 
considered it when it was first made.
Ms W accepted my provisional decision.  PayPal indicated it would reconsider Ms Ws claim 
but that it would  not be upheld.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered again my provisional decision and the responses to it, I dont intend to 
change my mind. I note PayPal has indicated  it wouldnt uphold  Ms Ws claim. But I think 
that is a premature judgment.  I said in my provisional decision that she should be given the 
chance to provide the information  it asked for before  as she hasnt done that, I dont see 
that PayPal can fairly  decide her claim.
It decided when it considered the claim before that it needed further information from Ms W, 
and she hasnt yet had the opportunity to provide  it. She should be given that opportunity 
before PayPal finally determines her claim.  If once  its done so Ms W doesnt think its done 
so fairly, she may be able to make a complaint  about that at the time.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is that I uphold  this complaint and direct 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Contact Ms W to invite her to provide the information it asked her for previously, 
together with any other information  either Ms W or PayPal  consider  relevant;
Once Ms W has provided that information, or once a reasonable time not less 
than 14 days for its submission has passed,  re-consider  Ms Ws claim.
Ref: DRN36055543Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 August 2019.
