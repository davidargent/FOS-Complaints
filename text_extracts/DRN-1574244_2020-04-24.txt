The complaint
Mrs E says Bank of Scotland plc (BoS) mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
What happened
Mrs E took out a credit card with BoS in 2000. It also sold her a regular premium PPI policy 
to help protect her repayments if she couldnt work due to disability or unemployment.
Our adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld as they believed Mrs E had 
already been refunded the premiums shed paid. Mrs E didnt agree with the adjudicator, so 
the case was passed to me to review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website. And Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mrs Es case.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. Ill explain why.
Mrs E says she paid premiums for the PPI and wants them to be refunded to her. BoS hasnt 
commented on whether it mis-sold the PPI to Mrs E. But, if it did mis-sell it, wed expect BoS 
to compensate Mrs E for the premiums shes paid.
From the available evidence and copy statements, Im satisfied Mrs E paid premiums for the 
PPI in February and March 2001 totalling £5. Im also satisfied that BoS refunded Mrs E for 
the premiums in full by adding a £5 credit to her account in April 2001. 
I havent seen any evidence to indicate Mrs E paid any other premiums for the PPI. 
So, taking everything into account, Im persuaded Mrs Es already been compensated for the 
PPI premiums she paid. Accordingly, I find that BoS neednt make any further payments. 
My final decision
For the reasons given, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2020.
