The complaint
Mrs B says she was mis-sold a store card payment protection insurance (PPI) policy in 
2001. 
AXA France IARDs (AXA) taken responsibility for the sale for the purposes of this complaint.
What happened
Mrs B took out a PPI policy which primarily helped to protect her store card payments in the 
event of disability or unemployment. 
Our adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. Mrs B didnt agree with the 
adjudicator, so the case was passed to me to review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website. And 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Bs case.
Having done so, I dont consider that the PPI was mis-sold because:
Ive seen a copy of the store card application form Mrs B signed. It appears AXA 
made her aware that she had a choice about adding PPI and that she chose to take it 
by signing separately for it. I can understand if she doesnt remember that now, after 
all this time.
I dont consider that AXA recommended the PPI to Mrs B. So, it didnt have to check 
if the PPI was right for her. But AXA should have given her the information she 
needed to decide for herself if it was right for her. 
Its possible the information AXA gave Mrs B about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
should have been. But she chose to take out the PPI  so it looks like she wanted 
this type of cover. And I can see why, as Ive seen nothing to suggest she was 
entitled to enhanced sick pay for a significant time, whereas the PPI benefits were 
considerable and could potentially have paid out until the account balance was paid 
off. They covered her for unemployment too. And Mrs B had no other means of 
meeting the monthly card repayments if she wasnt working. 
Based on what Ive seen of Mrs Bs circumstances at the time it doesnt look like 
shed have been significantly affected by any of the exclusions to, or limits on, the 
PPI cover. So, it would have been useful to her if something went wrong. And I cant 
see anything to indicate shed have found the regular premium unaffordable. 
 Taking everything into account, I dont believe Mrs Bs lost out because of how AXA sold her 
the PPI.
My final decision
For the reasons given, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
