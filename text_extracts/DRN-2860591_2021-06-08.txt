The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA failed to collect a direct debit payment 
when they said they would. He said that this resulted in a missed payment marker being 
recorded on his credit file.
What happened
Mr R holds a PayPal credit account which was first opened in June 2019. He made fixed 
payments to the account each month by a direct debit set up with PayPal. On 29 April 2020, 
Mr R arranged to increase his monthly direct debit amount from £26 to £45.
Having completed the direct debit change, Mr R received an email from PayPal. It confirmed 
that the direct debit amount had been changed. It is also said that the change would come 
into effect after the current payment due date of 4 May 2020. The email confirmed that 
PayPal would take £26, as previously instructed on that date.
However, the payment due on 4 May 2020 wasnt collected from Mr Rs bank account. Mr R 
hadnt noticed this. But he later saw that a missed payment marker had been recorded on 
his credit file. He said that he hadnt been told about this by PayPal. So, he contacted 
PayPal on 18 June 2020.
PayPal told Mr R that any amount owed or overdue wouldve been shown on his PayPal 
account. But Mr R couldnt find this. Mr R sent PayPal a copy of the email hed received from 
them after changing his direct debit amount. But PayPal told him that they wouldnt remove 
the missed payment marker.
Mr R raised the matter as a complaint with PayPal. They replied to him by email on 21 July 
2020. They said that after changing his direct debit amount, a manual payment wouldve 
needed to be made. They confirmed that the late payment marker would not be removed.
Mr R wasnt happy with PayPals response to his complaint. So, he decided to refer matters 
to this service. One of our investigators has looked into the circumstances of Mr Rs 
complaint. He thought that PayPal hadnt acted fairly here. He said that PayPal should 
remove the missed payment marker from Mr Rs credit file.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators findings. So, they asked that the complaint be 
referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
Having reviewed Mr Rs complaint, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. 
Because of that, I issued a provisional decision on 6 May 2021 giving both Mr R and PayPal 
the opportunity to respond to my findings below, before I reach a final decision.
In that decision, I said:
Ive reviewed Mr Rs PayPal credit account statements. I can see that Mr R was 
clearly making regular fixed payments by direct debit. It is also clear that no payment 
amount was claimed by PayPal in May 2020. Mr Rs subsequent statements show 
that fixed payments of £45 were being made by direct debit each month. So, this 
confirms what Mr R has told us. His direct debit amount had been amended and the 
May payment was missing.
I then looked at an email received by Mr R from PayPal dated 29 April 2020. It 
confirms that hed updated his monthly direct debit payment amount to his PayPal 
account. It also confirms that the change would come into effect after the payment 
due date of 4 May 2020. Critically, it goes on to say, On that date, well take £26.00 
GBP from your bank accountas you previously instructed. The email makes no 
mention of a requirement to make payment by any other means. From this, I think 
that it wouldve been reasonable to conclude that PayPal wouldve claimed £26 
under the direct debit on 4 May 2020.
In PayPals response to Mr Rs complaint, they said When you change your direct 
debit via the app or the website, the system generates a message to state when this 
new payment arrangement will take effect. On this occasion a manual payment 
would have needed to be made. Ive not been provided with any evidence to show 
that Mr R had been told this.
PayPal said to us that Mr R cancelled his direct debit on 29 April 2020 and set up a 
new direct debit for the new amount effective from 10 May 2020. They said that the 
payment due on 4 May 2020 was missed because there was no active/effective 
direct debit. They also enclosed a copy of their notification to Mr R as evidence of 
this. The notification provided by PayPal was a copy of the email received by Mr R on 
29 April 2020 which Ive referred to above. This notification makes no reference to 
the direct debit being cancelled. Only that the direct debit amount had been updated.
PayPal also said that they prepared PayPal Credit statements for Mr R and sent him 
relevant email notifications in a timely manner. The May statement sent to Mr R 
includes the message, Your PayPal Credit account currently has a(n) amount due 
for payment. Please remedy this situation at your soonest convenience in order to 
prevent further contact from us. I dont think this is a clear communication of arrears 
and I can understand why Mr R may not have read it that way.
So, having considered all of the information provided to us, I agree with our 
investigator here. I dont think that PayPal have communicated clearly or acted fairly 
here, so I intend to ask them to put things right. But I also recognised that this will 
have caused Mr R unnecessary concern and inconvenience. Finding that adverse 
information has been incorrectly recorded on your credit file can be very worrying. 
Particularly as this could have a negative impact upon Mr Rs ability to secure credit 
in the future. So, I also intend to ask PayPal to compensate Mr R for this.
Mr R acknowledged receipt of my provisional decision and had nothing more to add.
PayPal confirmed that theyd already outlined their position concerning the case in the 
original files provided to this service. They reiterated their position that they believe the 
correct procedures have been used and that they acted in accordance with their User 
Agreement and its policies therein.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals original response confirms that Mr R accepted their user agreement. They also 
referenced section 2.5 of the agreement relating to missed payments and any 
consequences. 
In my provisional decision, I acknowledged that the payment due on 4 May 2020 was 
missed. However, I also explained why I couldnt reasonably hold Mr R responsible for this. I 
dont believe that PayPal made it clear to Mr R that the direct debit due on 4 May 2020 
wouldnt be claimed. Their email of 29 April 2020 confirms that a payment of £26 would be 
claimed on 4 May 2020  but it wasnt. I dont believe that was Mr Rs fault.Having given both Mr R and PayPal the opportunity to consider my provisional decision, 
neither party has provided me with anything that leads me to change my mind. So, my 
decision here will remain as detailed in my provisional decision of 6 May 2021. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
amend Mr Rs credit file by removing any related adverse information relating to the 
missed payment,
pay compensation to Mr R of £100 to reflect any worry and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2021.
