K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny  was 
irresponsible when  it provided him with 12 high-cost short-term instalment loans between 
May 2015 and July 2016.
background
Mr M took 12 loans with Sunny between 18 May 2015 and 25 July 2016. All the loans were  
due to be repaid  through six monthly instalments. The amounts of the loans varied  between  
£50 and £300. I've prepared a table showing some  of the information Sunny has provided 
about Mr Ms loans.

Nine of the loans were  taken whilst  one or two of the earlier loans were still outstanding. The 
last column in my table  shows  how much Mr M was due to repay  each month on his live 
loans. 
None of the loans went to term as they were  all repaid  early.  
One of our adjudicators investigated Mr Ms complaint  and recommended  that it be partially 
upheld. He didnt  think that Sunny acted responsibly when it provided Loans  6 to 12. Sunny 
doesnt accept  our adjudicators assessment. Although it did make  an offer to Mr M as 
regards Loans  11 and 12 which hasnt been accepted  by Mr M. 
As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  it has come  to me - an ombudsman  - for a 
final decision. If Mr M accepts my decision it will be binding  on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN54700952complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr M. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer  has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Whilst 
that might  be an indication a borrower  could sustainably make their repayments, it doesnt 
automatically follow. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as 
meaning that a borrower could repay the loans over the term of the agreement  without 
undue difficulties, on time, whilst meeting other  reasonable commitments and without having 
to borrow to meet those  repayments. And the regulations said that an assessment should 
take into account more than simply  assessing the customer's ability to repay the credit.
With this in mind Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided and what  this all means for Mr Ms complaint.  
Mr M borrowed his first loan (£300) in May 2015.  He told Sunny that his monthly income was 
£2,000. It asked him about some of his expenditure and assessed that he had a monthly  
disposable income of around £1,200. The repayments on Loan 1 were due to be around £96 
per month. In these  circumstances I dont think it would be fair to conclude  that Sunny failed 
to do enough  when it approved Loan  1.
Mr M repaid Loan 1 after just 17 days,  making a single payment of £340. He came  back for 
Loan 2 around  seven  weeks  later. The loan amount was half what Mr M had borrowed with 
Loan 1 and the monthly repayments were due to be significantly  less at around £46.  
Again, Sunny asked Mr M some questions  about  his income and outgoings. He declared 
similar figures to those  he stated for Loan  1 - except his utilities  reduced to £75 from £200 
meaning that his declared disposable  income increased to over £1,300. I dont think that this 
Ref: DRN54700953change was so significant that  in these circumstances  Sunny ought to have done more 
checks at this stage.
But Im not persuaded that Sunny did enough to check the sustainability of Mr Ms loans 
from the point he took Loan 3. Loans 3 and 4 were  taken  within  days  of Loan 2 and meant  
that Mr M now had a capital balance of £350 and his monthly repayments were due to be 
over £106.  
I think that Sunny shouldve had concerns that the borrowing wasnt  sustainable when  Mr M 
applied for Loan  5 - £300. He had repaid Loans 2 and 3 a few days before together with a 
repayment on Loan 4  so on 11 September hed paid £201  to Sunny and here he was three  
days later applying for a loan of £300.  But as I only have  limited evidence about  Mr Ms 
financial circumstances at the time, Im not able to say that, had Sunny done proportionate 
checks, it wouldve  seen  that Loans  3, 4 and 5 were unaffordable for him. So, Im not 
upholding his complaint about  those.
However, Loan 6 was Mr Ms sixth loan in five months. Loans 4 and 5 had recently  been  
repaid - a week before - with a payment to Sunny of over £400. He was now borrowing £200 
again. So, I'm satisfied  that a pattern had emerged. And it continued.  Four days  after Mr M 
took Loan 6, he borrowed  Loan 7. I accept that there  was a short  break between Mr M 
repaying Loans 6 and 7 with a payment of nearly £260 and taking Loan 8. And that this was 
for a lower  amount. But even, according  to the information Sunny had, Mr M s credit  
commitments had now more than doubled since hed started borrowing from Sunny earlier in 
the year. The pattern continued  later that month  when Mr M took Loan 9  another  £100 
loan. 
From Loan  6, the indications were that Mr M was dependent on these  loans and in a cyclical 
pattern of borrowing.
There was an established pattern  of him taking  out loans which were overlapping earlier 
ones. I note that Sunny argues that Mr M repaid his loans early and that this wasnt  
consistent with [Mr M] being in financial difficulty. But in my experience  patterns such  as 
this one - taking numerous loans over a very short period, soon after earlier ones  are repaid, 
and which  often overlap with earlier ones  - more likely suggests that the consumer is 
struggling financially  and juggling  their credit commitments to try to stay afloat.  Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having  to borrow  further  to cover the 
hole which  was left as a result  of earlier credit repayments. 
I think this overall pattern  of Mr Ms lending history  with Sunny means  that it shouldve  
realised that further  lending  was unsustainable  and potentially harmful for him from Loan 6.
In these circumstances Im satisfied that Loan 6 onwards shouldnt  have been provided to 
Mr M and I uphold  his complaint about  them.
putting things right
Sunny should  not have provided Loans  6 to 12 to Mr M so I require it to do the following to 
put things right:
Ref: DRN54700954a)Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on Loans 6 to 12, 
b)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr M which  were  
considered as part of a) calculated from the date he originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled
c)Pay Mr M the total of a) plus b).
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny  to deduct tax from this interest.  It should give Mr M a certificate 
showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
I also require Sunny to remove  all information from his credit file about Loan 6 to 12. This is 
because the overall  pattern  of his borrowing by the time he took these loan means any 
information recorded about them is adverse 
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2020.
