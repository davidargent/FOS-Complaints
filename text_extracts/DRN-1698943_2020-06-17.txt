Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ws complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been given as they thought the pattern of borrowing indicated    Miss W was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but agreed to uphold from loan 10 
onwards instead. Miss W declined Sunnys offer so, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss W could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Miss W 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making 
further findings on them.Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Miss W and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Miss Ws fourth loan in less than two 
months, I think Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Miss Ws 
finances before lending her this loan. 
I think Miss W was having problems managing her money. I say this because she was taking 
out an additional loan two days after shed taken out loan 3 and she was borrowing the same 
amount. Loans 1 and 2 were also still outstanding. Miss Ws combined monthly repayment 
had increased in this same time from £30 for loan one to over £100 at loan 3 and was to 
increase a further £50 at loan 4 to be over £150. I think Sunny ought to have been 
concerned about this behaviour as it was likely Miss W would struggle to sustain her 
repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think that this point was reached by loan 8. I 
say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss W was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out eight loans in just under six months. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss W was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ws first loan was for £100 and loan 8 was for £600.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known that it was unlikely Miss W was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out around ten months after Miss Ws first. And it was for the same amount. 
Miss W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
 
I think that Miss W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ws ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans 4 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 7 from Miss Ws credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 8 to 14 should be removed from 
Miss Ws credit file.
                                                                                                                                 * HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
