Ms P complains  that HSBC UK Bank  Plc failed to prevent  her from becoming a victim of a 
scam and losing £30,000 from her bank account with HSBC.
background
Ms P holds a current account with HSBC. She was looking for a way to invest her money 
and found an unregulated  broker online called Capital City Markets  (CCM). In between 
August 2017 and May 2018,  she made  the following payments to the broker  through online 
banking:
Date Account number Payee/beneficiary Amount
24 August 
2017CZ9103840109 Capital City Markets £10,000
24 August 
2017CZ9103840109 Capital City Markets £10,000
20 September 
2017CZ9103840109 Capital City Markets £10,000
29 May 2018 PL4810059656 Capital City Markets £10,000
29 May 2018 PL4810059656 Capital City Markets £20,000
Ms P was able to trade, reinvest and withdraw  funds through CCM throughout 2017. Before 
making the payments on 29 May 2018, she says she spoke to the broker and discussed 
making a further  investment for it to trade in forex markets in segregated brokerage 
accounts, for which she was promised a return of at least 10%. Ms P was also shown 
screenshots of CCMs  trading  performance that showed even higher returns.
Following her discussion with CCM, Ms P transferred two payments totalling £30,000 on 
29 May 2018. She later became concerned after she was unable  to contact the broker and 
discovered that she had been trading on a simulated account that wasnt  actually trading on 
any live markets. Ms P contacted HSBC on 23 July 2018 to report the fraudulent payments. 
They contacted the beneficiary bank that was located in Poland,  but received no response, 
so they were unable  to retrieve  the £30,000  she had paid. 
Ms P complained as she says HSBC  ought  to have  prevented these payments from being  
made as they were  to new payees  and ought  to have been flagged as suspicious.
Our investigator upheld  the complaint. He agreed that HSBC ought  to have intervened  on 
29 May 2018 as there were multiple reasons to believe  that Ms P was at risk of losing her 
money to a scam. The investigator thought that if HSBC had intervened and questioned  
Ms P about the payments, she would have done  some more research which wouldve 
highlighted the warnings and concerns of others posted online about the broker. HSBC  
disagreed, so that matter was passed  to me to determine.
Ref: DRN13423692I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 18 February 2021. I said I didnt intend  
to uphold Ms Ps complaint as I didnt think HSBC could fairly be held liable for the loss of 
her money to CCM, and set out the following provisional findings:
Capital City Markets represented itself as an investment  brokerage  based overseas 
in Vanuatu. It was not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) but it was 
registered with the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission until it was struck off and 
deregistered in September  2020. CCM  stopped  responding to Ms P after she paid 
them £30,000 on 29 May 2018. 
There is no question here that Ms P has lost the money she invested. But the 
question I must consider  here is the extent to which HSBC can be considered liable 
for her loss. I also need to consider whether the bank did all that they ought to have  
done when Ms P reported that she had been defrauded. In this particular case  Im 
not persuaded that HSBC  should refund Ms P the amount she lost.
It is common ground that Ms P authorised the payments she made to Capital City 
Markets in both 2017  and 2018. She used her security credentials  to request the 
payment online and, in broad terms, the starting position in law is that a bank is 
expected to process payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to 
make, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the customers  account. And 
under the Payment Service Regulations 2009  (for those payments made in 2017) 
and the Payment Service Regulations 2017 (for the payments made in 2018) Ms P is 
presumed liable for the loss in the first instance.  
So Ive gone  on to consider whether HSBC should have done more to identify the 
CCM transactions as potentially being  fraudulent and prevented  Ms P from making 
them, because there are some situations  in which a bank should reasonably have 
had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular transfer. For 
example, if it was particularly out of character for Ms P.
To determine this, Ive looked at the statements for Ms Ps accounts covering the 
period of May 2017 to May 2018  to get an idea of her general account usage  at the 
time. In terms of the 2017  payments to CCM,  the first transaction was made on 24 
August 2017 for £10,000. I can see that she regularly made online transfers, so I 
dont think the payment  type was particularly  unusual  for her at the time. I appreciate 
the amount in question was higher than she has transferred in the months prior to the 
transaction. But I dont  think  it was significantly  higher such  that the amount ought to 
have been regarded as suspicious or indicating that Ms P might  have been at risk of 
falling for a scam. 
I acknowledge that there  were potentially a couple of red flags  on 24 August 2017 
given that Ms P had made two large  payments in quick succession  to a new 
international payee. But there appears  to have been very little at the time to suggest  
that CCM was a fraudulent investment company, such that any intervention  by HSBC 
wouldve likely made no difference to Ms P deciding to proceed with those  
transactions. She said, for example, that she had googled them  at the time and 
hadnt found anything negative, and that they had also appeared in some investment 
newsletters that she was subscribed to. Ms P has also said that in 2017 she was able 
to trade  and reinvest through CCM, and that she was also able to withdraw around 
£10,000 from her account with the broker. So it seems that, in 2017 at least,  there 
Ref: DRN13423693was nothing to suggest that CCM was anything  but a legitimate brokerage. 
Therefore, I dont think any intervention or probing questions by HSBC about the 
nature of the payments  would have made it apparent to Ms P that CCM (at that time) 
was potentially fraudulent.
Ms P then didnt have  any issues with CCM in 2017  and even made returns on her 
investments which  she either  reinvested with CCM  or withdrew. And given that the 
two payments made on 24 August 2017  to the broker had not been reported to 
HSBC as being potentially fraudulent or having  led to any loss, I dont think the bank 
had any reason to prevent the third payment of £10,000 being made to CCM  on 20 
September 2017. 
In terms of the 2018 transactions, Ms P made  two payments to CCM  on 29 May 
2018. The first was for an amount of £10,000, and the second  was for £20,000 a few 
minutes after. Considering first the payment of £10,000, I appreciate  that the account 
details were not the same as those Ms P used  to make the payments to CCM in 
2017. But given  that she had already made several  large transfers of £10,000 to 
international payees (with the same company name) with no issues of fraud, I dont  
think this ought  to have been  flagged as unusual when compared with her regular 
account activity  over the preceding 6-12 months.  So I dont think this payment ought 
to have prompted HSBC to intervene.
I appreciate the £20,000 payment was a much  larger amount. But again,  Ms P had a 
history of making large  payments to investment companies. I can see on her 
statements that CCM wasnt the only broker/investment company she was making 
payments to, as there are others, such as a total of £17,000 being transferred to 
IG.com (an online spread betting provider)  on 4 September 2017, as well as two 
payments of £5,000 being made to Darwinex (another online trading  brokerage) in 
December 2017.  Ms P had also previously transferred  £20,000 to CCM  on 24 August  
2017 when she made the two payments of £10,000  in the same day. So I dont think 
the circumstances of the transaction ought  to have  prompted HSBC to question 
whether Ms P might  have  been at risk of falling victim to a scam, because the 
payment wasnt so different or the circumstances so unusual  that the bank ought to 
have contacted her to make enquiries about the payment before they processed it.
So I dont  think HSBC  failed in their obligations  when  they failed to treat the 2018 
transfers as suspicious, and I think  they acted reasonably when they processed the 
payments without further checks.
Even if the £20,000  payment could  be regarded as suspicious (which I do not think  it 
was), I still do not think any intervention by HSBC would have likely made  any 
difference. I appreciate there may have been negative reviews  online about CCM at 
that point. But there  were  no FCA warnings about the broker, and they were still 
seemingly classed as registered  with the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission  at 
that point, as they were not stuck  off that register  until September  2020. Ms P has 
also said she was able to withdraw around £4,000  from CCM in April 2018  just one 
month before she made the payments  on 29 May 2018. So I dont think  any 
intervention or enquiries from HSBC about  the nature  of the payments would have  
made it apparent  to Ms P that she was at risk of losing her money, because she had 
been trading with no problems up until that point and had recently  been  able to 
withdraw her money.
Ref: DRN13423694Ive also considered whether HSBC did everything  it ought to have done when the 
2018 payments  were  reported as fraudulent. Ms P contacted HSBC  on 23 July 2018.  
She told them that she wasnt getting any response  from CCM  and that they might be 
scammers, so she wanted them to investigate whether she could get her money 
back. However, HSBC  failed to take any action  at that point, and it wasnt  until Ms P 
complained in January 2019  that they sought to recover the funds. They  attempted to 
make contact with the receiving bank based  in Poland, but said they received no 
response. And given that the receiving bank was not part of the UK Voluntary Push 
Payment Scheme, HSBC  said they were  unable to assist any further, so it isnt clear 
whether the funds still remained in the account at that point or whether the money 
had been withdrawn.
Its clear that HSBC failed  to act when Ms P reported the potential fraud to them in 
July 2018. But while this certainly amounts to poor service on the part of the bank, I 
dont think their failure to act ultimately prejudiced their ability  to recover  the £30,000. 
HSBC didnt receive a response to their requests made to the receiving bank when 
they made contact  in January 2019, so theres little to suggest they would have 
received a response if they had acted  any earlier. I do, however, consider that 
HSBCs failure  to act in July 2018  would have likely caused trouble and upset to Ms 
P. But the bank  awarded £100 compensation in recognition of the poor service Ms P 
received, which  I consider  to be fair compensation in the circumstances. So I do not 
intend to make any further award.  
In conclusion, I think HSBC acted reasonably by processing the payments,  and I 
dont think they couldve done anything more  to have prevented the loss of Ms Ps 
money. So I dont  think  they need  to provide a refund to her.
I invited further comments  before making my final decision.  Ms P responded disagreeing 
with my provisional decision.  In summary,  shes  said:
 
She was relying  on HSBC to protect  her from becoming the victim of a scam. The 
2017 payments  should have been flagged  as unusual, and had these transactions  
have been challenged, the 2018  payments to CCM would never have been 
processed.
There were  several red flags that should  have resulted  in intervention  from HSBC,  
including large amounts  in quick succession  to a new international payee; the 
payment taking the account overdrawn; and different account details being  used.
There are reports that CCMs bank accounts were frozen in 2018  as they were under 
investigation, and subsequently had their license revoked by the Vanuatu Financial 
Services Commission on 4 July 2019.  HSBC must have been aware of the 
investigation.
Had HSBC checked the payments with her and said it was likely  to be a scam, she 
would have reconsidered her actions and not have  gone  ahead with the payments.  
HSBC failed to investigate the scam when she raised it with them on 23 July 2018  
and chose to ignore  it until she sent a formal  written complaint in January 2019, 
meaning they had missed the opportunity to recover the funds. So, £100 is not fair 
compensation.
My findings
Ref: DRN13423695Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  including  Ms Ps recent 
submissions  to decide whats  fair and reasonable in the circumstances  of this complaint. 
But having  done so, it does not change the conclusions  set out in my provisional decision, 
and I have decided  not to uphold it.
Ms P says HSBC should have prevented the 2017  payments from leaving her account. But 
Ive already explained that I didnt think the first £10,000 transferred on 24 August 2017 was 
a significant or unusually  high amount to be paid from her account  in comparison to previous 
transfers. I acknowledged that there were potentially  a couple of red flags  in terms of two 
payments of £10,000  being made on the same day to an international payee. But even if 
HSBC were wrong to have allowed these payments to leave Ms Ps account in 2017, Ive 
seen nothing to suggest that there  was anything that would have led her (or HSBC)  to 
believe that CCM was a fraudulent brokerage. Indeed, Ms P said herself that she googled 
them at the time and could not find anything negative in 2017, and was subsequently able to 
trade, reinvest and withdraw money  through them. So Im still not persuaded that HSBC 
wouldve had any reasonable grounds  to doubt  the legitimacy of the payments at this time.
With regards to the 2018 payments, Ms P has reiterated her submission that there were 
several red flags that ought to have alerted HSBC  to the potential  for fraud. But Ive already 
considered this previously  when  I said I didnt think the payments made on 29 May 2018  
ought to have prompted HSBC to intervene. Its important to note that the circumstances  
Ms P has listed can only be considered as red flags if they can be regarded as unusual 
when compared  to the regular activity on the account. And I dont think  the circumstances of 
the 2018 transactions were unusual.  She had already made several  large transfers of 
£10,000 in the past to international payees  as well as large payments to other  investment 
companies like IG.com. She had also made  large payments that had taken her account 
overdrawn in the past, such as those  made  to IG.com on 4 September 2017 which took her 
£1,176 overdrawn. So, Im not persuaded the 2018 transactions  would have come  across as 
unusual when compared to her regular  account  activity. 
I appreciate that two large payments were made in the same day to a new account number 
But given that Ms P had made  similar payments in the past to the payee Capital City 
Markets without incident, I dont think HSBC had reasonable grounds to suspect that this 
payment was unusual  or that it indicated  she was at risk of being scammed. So Im afraid  
Ms Ps response to my provisional  decision in this regard does not change my conclusions,  
and I still do not think any intervention by HSBC was warranted in these  circumstances.  
Ms P says that CCM  had their license revoked by the Vanuatu Financial Services  
Commission in July 2019. But this was almost  a year after Ms P had made the transactions 
in May 2019.  There was no FCA warning that Ive been made aware of, and while I 
appreciate the brokers account may have  been  frozen by other  international authorities,  Im 
still not persuaded that HSBC ought to have known  that the payee Ms P was transferring 
money to was fraudulent. 
I understand Ms P feels strongly that she would have acted differently had HSBC have got in 
contact with her. But for the reasons Ive already  explained, I do not think they failed in their 
obligations when  they failed to treat the 2018 transfers as suspicious,  so there was no 
reason why they ought to have prevented  the payments or have carried  out further checks. 
Ms P also says that HSBC missed the opportunity to recover  her funds when they failed to 
take any action  in July 2018 when the fraud was reported. But seeing as there was no 
Ref: DRN13423696response from the receiving bank,  it isnt known what became  of the funds, and so it cannot 
reasonably be said that their inaction prejudiced Ms Ps chances of recovering her money   
as it seems unlikely the receiving bank wouldve responded even if it was contacted in July 
2018. So, Im still satisfied that £100  is fair compensation for HSBCs failure to investigate 
the fraud when it was first reported, as Im not persuaded it had any further impact that 
causing moderate trouble and upset due to poor service. 
I understand this will come as a disappointment  to Ms P, and I sympathise with her situation  
as its clear she has lost a significant  amount  of money as a result of CCM absconding with 
her funds. But in the circumstances, Im unable to fairly hold HSBC  responsible  for that loss.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 March  2021.
