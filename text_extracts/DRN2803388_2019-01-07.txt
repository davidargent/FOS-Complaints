K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains about what  National Westminster  Bank Plc did when he told it he was 
moving house.
background
Mr R told us that he contacted NatWest  to change his address at the start of November.  He 
said that he was expecting a new card for his current account that month, so he wanted  to 
make sure that this was sent to his new address. He said that NatWest had reassured him 
about that.
At the end of November, Mr R contacted  NatWest  to check what had happened to his new 
card, and he was told the new card was sent to his old address. A transaction had been  
carried out on the new card. Mr R thought  this must  be fraudulent.  NatWest  paid him back  
the money for the transaction, and it also paid him £50 in compensation to make up for 
sending his card to the wrong address. 
Mr R told us that hed since  discovered that the transaction was genuine. It was made 
through a mobile phone payment service provider, but he didnt know that this payment 
service provider could  update his card without his permission.  He said that the refund money 
was taken back out of his account. 
Mr R said he wanted to know how his card had been sent to the wrong address. He wanted 
to know how NatWest  had authorised  the payment service provider to update  his card 
without informing him or asking for his approval. And he wanted to know  why those  
transactions werent refunded. 
Mr R said that he had received a reply from NatWest, but it didnt address his questions. He 
said he was concerned that contactless bank cards  can be used even after they are 
cancelled. And he said that he was really  concerned for the safety  of his banking  details. He 
said that the payment service provider should  never  have access to his details without his 
approval. 
Mr R said that NatWest  should answer his questions and apologise for its failings. And he 
said that it should accept responsibility  for what has gone wrong, and compensate  him 
adequately. 
NatWest said that it had sent the card to the wrong address. It said that this mightve  been  
because the card had already been  ordered by the time Mr R changed his address. It said 
that it was sorry for any problems this had caused. And it was sorry that Mr R had been told 
that the card wasnt sent to his old address.
It said that the transactions made on that card had since been confirmed as genuine.  Mr R 
had made  those transactions. Thats why it had taken  the refund back. 
NatWest said that if a mobile  phone payment service  provider  was holding an old card 
number, and that old card number was used for a transaction, then the new card details 
would automatically  be picked up by that provider when the transaction was sent to 
NatWest. It didnt think it had made  a mistake about  that.
Ref: DRN28033882NatWest had paid Mr R £50 in compensation and £10.08 to pay for call charges. It said that 
if hed paid more  than this to call, it would cover any extra  costs  if he sent it his bills. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold this complaint. He said that NatWest  had acknowledged  its 
error, so he was looking to see if what NatWest  had done had put the mistake right. He said 
that NatWest had now updated  Mr Rs address. 
Our adjudicator said that it wasnt NatWests fault that the mobile phone payment service  
provider updated  card details automatically. So he didnt think  it had done  anything wrong by 
paying those transactions.  And he said that the transactions that Mr R had made were  
genuine, so NatWest didnt have to give this money  back.
Mr R didnt agree with that. He said that dealing with this had taken a lot of his time, and 
caused a lot of distress.  He said that NatWest wasnt  able to say what  had happened,  and 
not able to reassure him that his money was safe, because the new card was contactless  
and had been sent to the wrong address. And it had told us that it didnt know what  had 
happened.  
Mr R repeated that no third party company should  be able to access  his personal  details  
without his consent. He said that any authorisation given  to this mobile phone payment 
service provider was confirmed with NatWest,  and he had added new cards  just to prove  it. 
He said this was a clear  breach of privacy  by giving out his details  without his authorisation, 
consent or knowledge. He didnt think that hed been reassured that his details were  safe,  
and he didnt think that NatWest had done enough to make  up for what had gone wrong.
Because Mr R didnt agree with our adjudicator, the case  was passed to me for a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest said, when  it wrote to Mr R, that it might  have sent the card to the wrong address 
because the card had already been  ordered by the time Mr R changed his address. Ive 
seen NatWests internal  notes on this, and the card had already been ordered  by the time he 
changed his address. Thats where  things started to go wrong. So I dont think  that its right 
to say that NatWest  hasnt been able to offer any explanation  for this. 
I still think though  that Mr R prompted NatWest  about his card when he changed his 
address, so his new card shouldnt then have been issued to an out of date address. And, as 
NatWest has said,  Mr R shouldnt have been  told that his card was going to be sent to his 
new address. I do think that NatWest  made  a mistake when it allowed this card to be issued 
to an old address.
Because NatWest  made that mistake,  then if the card had been used for any fraudulent 
transactions, I wouldve expected NatWest to pay that money back. And when NatWest 
thought that there had been some fraudulent transactions  on the card,  it made a refund  of 
that money to Mr R. But it wasnt. The only transactions on the card were made by Mr R.
Mr R says that NatWest gave his new card details to the payment service  provider,  without 
his permission. He says thats not safe, and NatWest didnt have his permission to do that. 
Ref: DRN28033883He says that when he adds a new card to his mobile  phone  payment service provider, it has 
to be specifically authorised by the bank. And that hadnt happened with the replacement  
card, so he said that there had been  a mistake  by NatWest.
I dont agree with that. The online help and support pages for Mr Rs mobile  phone  payment 
service provider make clear that many card providers will automatically update card details if 
someone is given  a replacement card on expiry of the old card.  In fact, this isnt unique to his 
payment service provider.  Its being  implemented by the card scheme operator, whose 
symbol is on his card.
That means that automatic updating of card details is becoming  increasingly common  with 
all card providers. So if Mr R has given his card details  for any particular account to a 
payment provider, he isnt necessarily  going to be asked to authorise that provider again, if 
the account remains authorised and the card is just replaced. Thats  being done  to make 
card payments easier  and more convenient for customers. I dont think thats the same as 
making the first authorisation of a card on an entirely new account thats being added to a 
payment provider. And I dont think that what has happened here is a breach of security or of 
privacy. 
I think that the payment of £50 that NatWest has made to Mr R is enough  to make up for 
whats gone wrong in this case. That means I dont think NatWest has to do any more. And, 
although I know Mr R will be disappointed,  it also means I dont think this complaint  should 
be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2019.
