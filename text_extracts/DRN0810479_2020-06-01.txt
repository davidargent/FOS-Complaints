K821x#15complaint
Mrs C complains about end of contract  charges  when her agreement with PSA Finance UK 
Limited ended.
background
I issued provisional  decision on this complaint, a copy of which is attached and forms part of 
this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mrs Cs complaint and ask 
PSA to remove the charges.  I invited Mrs C and PSA to let me have any further evidence  or 
arguments they wanted to make before I finally determined the matter.
Mrs C didnt respond to my provisional decision.  PSA said there was nothing further it 
wanted to submit.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs C hasnt responded and PSA has said it doesnt want to make any further arguments. 
Having reconsidered  everything I see no reason to reach different conclusions  from the ones 
I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint. I order PSA Finance UK Limited to remove  the 
charges.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2020.
