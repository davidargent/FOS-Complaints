Complaint
Miss C has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly continued 
applying charges to her overdraft when she was in difficulty and that this caused her 
financial hardship.
  
Background
One of our adjudicators looked at Miss Cs complaint and thought NatWest should have 
realised Miss Cs overdraft had become unsustainable for her by March 2014 and so it 
needed to refund all the interest, fees and charges it added to Miss Cs overdraft from this 
point. NatWest disagreed so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for review.   
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I think NatWest acted unfairly when it 
continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from March 2014. By this point, it 
was evident Miss C was struggling to repay what she owed. 
A cursory look at her statements leading up to this period shows that the account hadnt 
seen a credit balance for an extended period of time. Indeed, I note that NatWests 
casehandler described this overdraft as a short-term borrowing product yet apart from a 
period of a day, NatWest left Miss C languishing in her overdraft for a further four and a half 
years from March 2014. 
So I think that by March 2014 NatWest should have stopped providing the overdraft on the 
same terms and treated Miss C with forbearance rather than adding even more interest, fees 
and charges on the overdraft.
All of this means that NatWest should have realised that Miss C was experiencing financial 
difficulty and offered her assistance. As NatWest didnt react to Miss Cs account usage and 
instead continued charging in the same way, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably. 
Miss C ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges at a time when she was 
already experiencing difficulty. So Im satisfied that Miss C lost out because of what NatWest 
did wrong and that it should put things right.  
Fair compensation  what NatWest needs to do to put things right for Miss C
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Miss Cs complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Miss Cs current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and 
charges applied to it from March 2014 onwards are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Miss C to arrange a suitable repayment plan 
for this. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on Miss Cs 
credit file, it should backdate this to March 2014.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Miss C along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Miss Cs credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Cs complaint. National Westminster 
Bank Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
