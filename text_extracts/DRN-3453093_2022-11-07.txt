The complaint
U complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs decision to permanently limit its 
account following a review and withholding its money.
Mr G brings the complaint on Us behalf.
What happened
U held an account with PayPal to allow it to take payments from its customers. In June 2020, 
PayPal placed a limitation on Us account following a review.
Mr G holds three PayPal accounts in total  one relating to a personal account, one relating 
to U and one to another company. Mr Gs personal account had a limitation on it which 
PayPal admitted was added incorrectly, and therefore removed it. However, the limitation on 
Mr Gs two business accounts, remained in place. 
PayPal informed U that it had violated their acceptable use policy and confirmed its account 
would be permanently limited. Mr G, on behalf of U, disagrees that U violated their policy.
The funds held in the account were withheld for around 180 days  being available to U 
around December 2020.
Our investigator reviewed things and didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly. In summary, he 
found that PayPal had previously asked U not to provide services to particular territories and 
as theyd found further payments from those particular countries, they were entitled to close 
Us account.
U remained unhappy. In summary, Mr G (on behalf of U) thought PayPal were entitled to 
make the decision to close Us account  but shouldnt have said U violated the policy, as he 
didnt think it had.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat evidence from 
banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains information about 
other customers, security information or commercially sensitive information. Some of the 
information PayPal has provided is information that we considered should be kept 
confidential. 
Like our investigator, Im satisfied that PayPal were entitled to review Us account and 
subsequently close it. The user agreement which U would have agreed to when it opened its 
account with PayPal sets out the terms under which PayPal operates the account. The term 
explains that PayPal can close an account at any time if; 
You are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close 
your account under this user agreement. 
I recognise U doesnt accept it breached PayPals policy  it thinks PayPals decision was 
related to the activity on a linked account. But Im satisfied based on the evidence Ive 
received that PayPals actions were fair. Ultimately, PayPal reviewed the use of Us account 
and identified an issue with the use of it so made the decision to permanently limit the use of 
the account. While I appreciate U doesnt necessarily agree with the reasons, I cant fairly 
uphold Us complaint on that point. This service wont generally intervene in a banks 
commercial discretion. PayPal exercised their right to no longer offer U facilities and I've 
seen nothing to suggest that theyve made an unfair decision. So, I cant fairly ask them to 
do anything differently. 
PayPals user agreement also states that PayPal can Block your PayPal account and/or 
hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if 
so required by PayPal, where PayPal's rights arise from your engagement in the restricted 
activity).. Based on this, while I appreciate the inconvenience and disruption caused to U 
by PayPal holding on to its funds, I cant reasonably say they did anything wrong. Im 
pleased PayPal have since released the money to U as they should have. 
Ive thought carefully about what Mr G has said relating to PayPal making an unfair decision 
as he feels Us activity was only linked to violations rather than violating itself. Ive reviewed 
all of the evidence and arguments Ive received but Ive seen nothing to suggest PayPals 
decision is unfair. So  while I appreciate that U will be disappointed by my decision, I wont 
be asking PayPal to do anymore here.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask U to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2022.
