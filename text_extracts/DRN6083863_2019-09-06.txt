K821x#15complaint
Mrs G complains that Stagemount Limited  (trading as QuidMarket) lent money to her that 
she couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mrs G entered into 41 loans with QuidMarket  between  June 2012 and May 2018. The 
majority of the loans  were single repayment  loans and the more  recent  loans were 
instalment loans. The loans are set out in a table at the end of this decision.
Mrs G says that at the time of the loans she was making use of other short term loan 
providers and that her debts had spiralled out of control. She says the loans were 
unaffordable and she had to borrow again to meet her repayments. She says the number of 
loans she had damaged her credit rating  so that she wasnt  able to get longer term loans to 
consolidate her debts and so kept having  to borrow from short term loan providers.
QuidMarket says that before providing  the loans it carried  out affordability checks  in line with 
regulations in place at the time. It says it gathered information from Mrs G about her 
employment, income and expenses  and also carried out credit checks. It says these checks  
didnt raise concerns  about the affordability  of the loans.
Following Mrs Gs complaint to this service,  QuidMarket  investigated  its lending  to her and 
noted that Mrs G started to apply for sequential  loans, taking out a new loan on the same 
day she repaid her previous loan. It says that further information  could have been  requested  
at this point and while it couldnt  say if this would have changed the lending  decision as this 
could have been the case, it agreed  to uphold this complaint in regard to loans nine to 36.
 
Our adjudicator said that he hadnt seen  enough  to say it was unfair  that loans one to five 
and loans 39 to 41 were provided.  He noted  that Quidmarket had upheld Mrs Gs complaint 
in regard to loans nine to 36 but thought that loans six, seven, eight, 37 and 38 should also 
be upheld.
QuidMarket didnt agree with all of the recommendations in our adjudicators view. It said 
that the point at which the loans shouldnt have  been provided  was subjective but said it 
reluctantly accepted the decision that loans six to eight should  be upheld  as well as those it 
had already upheld, namely loans nine to 36. It didnt accept that loans 37 and 38 should  be 
upheld. It said these  loans  were instalment loans and so a different product to the previous 
payday loans.  It says that Mrs G provided evidence showing she was capable  of meeting the 
repayments due under the instalment loans and that these  loans shouldnt  be upheld  just 
because of when  they were  taken out.  
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuidMarket needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mrs G could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account 
Ref: DRN60838632a number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts  and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuidMarket should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuidMarket was required to establish 
whether Mrs G could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
The early  loans in this case were provided  before CONC.  At that time the relevant  guidance  
was provided by the Office of Fair trading (OFT) and this also set out the need to make  a 
reasonable assessment of whether a borrower  can afford to meet repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Gs complaint.
Mrs G took out her first loan in June 2012  and continued to borrow  without any significant 
gaps until June 2015. During  this period she was often taking out new loans as soon as the 
previous loan was repaid and on certain  occasions took out new loans before repaying the 
previous loan. There was then a significant  break in her borrowing with the next loan not 
being taken out until August 2017.  Based  on this I find that loans one to 38 (as set out in the 
loan table)  form part of the first lending chain and the remaining loans (39 to 41) form a 
second lending  chain.
Ref: DRN60838633In regard to the first lending chain, I agree with our adjudicator that there  isnt enough  
evidence to say that loans  one to five shouldnt have  been provided. However, by the time 
Mrs G took out her sixth loan I think QuidMarket should have been concerned about her 
possible reliance on short term debt and carried  out a thorough financial assessment to 
check the loan was affordable. Had this happened  it would have realised that Mrs G was 
spending a substantial amount on gambling.  Given this it would have been clear  that lending  
to Mrs G at this time wasnt sustainable. I also note that from loan eight onwards, Mrs Gs 
pattern of borrowing was such  that QuidMarket should have realised that lending to her 
wasnt sustainable. Therefore, I agree with our adjudicator that refunds  should start form 
loan six and I note that QuidMarket accepted this part of the recommendation.
QuidMarket didnt accept  that refunds should be applied to loans 37 and 38. I note the 
comments about the change in product type from a payday loan to an instalment  loan;  
however I dont think this means that it was reasonable to provide the loans. I say this 
because Mrs G had taken  out a large  number of loans by this point and was clearly 
struggling to manage  her money. She was often taking out new loans as soon as, or shortly 
after, previous loans were  repaid and this pattern  continued with these loans. Given Mrs Gs 
pattern of borrowing I dont think it reasonable to consider lending  to her was sustainable at 
this time. Therefore I agree that the interest and charges on loans 37 and 38 should be 
refunded along  with the interest  and charges on loans six to 36.
In regard to the second lending chain, I can see that information about Mrs Gs income and 
expenses was gathered. Based on the information Mrs G provided and given the size of the 
repayments compared to her income I agree that there isnt enough evidence to say that 
these loans shouldnt  have been  provided.
Overall, I agree  with our adjudicators recommendation  that this complaint is upheld in 
regard to loans  six to 38.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Stagemount Limited  (trading as QuidMarket)  
should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mrs G paid on loans six to 38;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans six and seven from Mrs G's credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight means any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans eight to 38 should be removed from Mrs G's credit file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Stagemount  Limited (trading as QuidMarket)  to take off 
tax from this interest. Stagemount Limited (trading as QuidMarket) must give Mrs G a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 October  2019.
