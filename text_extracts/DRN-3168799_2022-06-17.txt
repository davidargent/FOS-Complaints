The complaint
Mr Z complains that UK Insurance Limited trading as Direct Line (UKI) overcharged him for 
car insurance in 2019 and 2020.
What happened
Mr Z had car insurance with UKI. In 2018 he was involved in a car accident which was 
logged by UKI as a fault claim. Because of this he lost his no claims discount (NCD). Mr Z 
later contacted UKI to tell it the third-party driver had accepted full responsibility for the 
accident and the claim had been settled in full. But when the policy renewed in 2019 and 
2020, Mr Z was still recorded as having made a fault claim in 2018 and only one-year NCD, 
so the renewal premiums were higher than they should have been. 
When Mr Z first contacted UKI to complain about the cost of the new policies, he was told 
the claim code would be changed and the NCD reinstated. He was also offered a refund of 
£573.24 to reflect the amount hed overpaid. Mr Z said this wasnt enough, so the call 
handler told him theyd look into it further and agreed a time to call him back. Unfortunately, 
the call didnt happen.
Mr Z complained to UKI because he felt it owed him more than £573.24. He said that even 
with the refund, the premium was still £500 more than it was before the accident. He 
believed he should have been refunded £1500 in total, which is the amount he thought he 
was overcharged over the two year period due to the reduction of the NCD. He told UKI he 
was also unhappy about the fact the call handler hadnt called him back and that he felt 
insulted by comments hed made during the initial call. 
UKI accepted there had been an error and it said Mr Z was owed £781.76 from the 2019 
premium and £196 from the 2020 premium. It also offered £100 compensation for the 
inconvenience caused by the failed call. It accepted it had miscalculated the refund and that 
its call handler had failed to call Mr Z back as arranged, offering £100 compensation for the 
inconvenience this had caused. 
Mr Z wasnt satisfied and so he complained to this service, explaining hed overpaid by 
£1200 in 2019 and £300 in 2020.
Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied UKI had 
shown what it would have charged in 2019 and 2020 if Mr Z had made no claims and still 
had 4 years NCD and, based on those figures, it had refunded £781.76 and £196 
respectively.  He didnt agree the refund should have been calculated using the premium Mr 
Z paid before the accident and he commented the existence of the claim, albeit not a fault 
claim, might still have impacted the price and, overall, he was satisfied the refunds reflected 
what Mr Z would likely have paid in 2019 and 2020 had the accident not happened.
Mr Z questioned why our investigator didnt know the excess and he explained he hadnt 
considered the excess because it was irrelevant, but that he had seen UKIs system notes 
detailing how it had arrived at the figures and was satisfied the evidence supported the 
amount refunded. 
Mr Z said he thought the NCD wasnt the only reason he was over-charged and that he 
wanted to know whether the same excess applied because this would impact the price. He 
said he wanted his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
UKIs investigations revealed there was a technical system error which had caused it to 
calculate the refund incorrectly in the first instance and Im satisfied with that explanation. It 
has accepted its call handler failed to call Mr Z back at the agreed time, but it offered to pay 
Mr Z £100 for the inconvenience, and Im satisfied that was fair.
Ive considered the claim notes in detail and I havent seen any evidence that Mr Z was 
treated or spoken to inappropriately at any point.
Mr Z was charged £2,391.20 for car insurance in 2018 (this was reduced by £440, from 
£2391.20 to £1,822.24 midway through the policy because he took a £400 voluntary 
excess). The premium increased to £3,172.96 in 2019 and £1432.48 in 2020. 
When the premiums were recalculated following Mr Zs complaint, UKI concluded he should 
have been charged £2391.20 in 2019 and £1236.48 in 2020. Based on these figures, it 
refunded £977.76 in total and Im satisfied thats fair.
UKI has shown evidence of what the renewal premium was based on when the loadings 
were added and also evidence that the loadings were removed once the claim code was 
corrected and 4 years NCD reinstated. It has shown that it re-worked the 2019 premium 
based on identical terms (including the excess) to the previous year and it has explained 
the refund from the 2020 premium was lower because Mr Z had upgraded his car and 
charged address. It has also explained the increase in the premium may be due to the 
fact there was an accident, notwithstanding the fact it was a no-fault claim and the NCD 
was unaffected. 
Im satisfied the explanations UKI has given for why the re-worked premiums are higher 
than the 2018 premiums are reasonable, and I think it was fair for it to have calculated 
the refunds it made based on those figures. So, I dont think it owes Mr Z any money.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
