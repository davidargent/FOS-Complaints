K820x#14complaint
Mr J says Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays) mis-sold him a Current Account Plus packaged 
bank account.  Hes used  a Claims Management  Company  (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Js complaint and didnt think Barclays had mis-sold the 
Current Account Plus account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Js complaint. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Mr J wouldve  
known this when  he was sold the Current Account Plus.  
The information Ive seen on Mr Js circumstances suggest he was eligible for and couldve 
used the main benefits included on the Current Account  Plus account. And while  Im open to 
the possibility  Mr J wasnt provided with absolutely everything he shouldve been, I havent 
seen anything to suggest clearer information  wouldve changed his decision to take the 
account in the first place. So, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Js complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2019.
