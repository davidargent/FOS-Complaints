The complaint
Mrs P complains that TransUnion International UK Limited trading as TransUnion reported 
someone elses information on her credit file. 
What happened
Mrs Ps mortgage application was turned down so she checked her credit file. Mrs P found 
information and entries about credit in someone elses name including a mortgage, loan, 
bank accounts and credit card as well as linked addresses. 
Mrs P complained to TransUnion and it took steps to amend her credit file. TransUnion said 
the issue had been caused after Mrs Ps data merged with someone who had similar 
personal information. TransUnion offered Mrs P £50 to apologise and said it would consider 
her losses. 
Mrs P referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
upheld the complaint and recommended TransUnion pay Mrs P £500 and take steps to 
ensure the third party information has been removed from her credit file. TransUnion offered 
£250 but didnt agree to pay the settlement recommended by the investigator. As a result, 
Mrs Ps complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs P has explained she was pregnant and looking for a new home when the problems with 
her credit file were discovered. Mrs P has told us her mortgage application was declined 
when the lender found unreported entries on her credit file that didnt match her application 
data. TransUnion accepts its systems merged two peoples details which meant Mrs Ps 
entry was wrong and says its taken steps to fix the errors. 
As all parties broadly agree about what happened, Ive focused on how I think Mrs Ps 
complaint should be resolved. Mrs P has told us her mortgage application was declined and 
process of purchasing a property substantially delayed. In addition to this, Mrs P was 
pregnant and I can understand how frustrating it mustve been to have to deal with the credit 
file issues at this time. I agree with the investigator that the issues raised had a significant 
impact on Mrs P and caused unnecessary distress and inconvenience. 
TransUnion made a counteroffer of £250 but Im not persuaded thats a fair way to resolve 
Mrs Ps complaint. In addition to ensuring Mrs Ps credit file information is correct Im going 
to tell TransUnion to pay Mrs P a total of £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by 
the issues raised. In my view, that figure more fairly reflects what happened and how Mrs P 
was impacted. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited 
trading as TransUnion to pay Mrs P a total of £500 (less any compensation already paid) 
and ensure her credit file is fully corrected.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 April 2022.
