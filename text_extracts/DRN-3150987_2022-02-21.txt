The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, put a block on his account at a time 
when he was struggling financially as a result of the impact of Covid-19 and had asked for 
financial assistance.
What happened
In April 2020, Mr C had outstanding arrears on his PayPal account of approximately Â£150. 
Mr C contacted PayPal and advised that he was struggling financially because of the impact 
of Covid-19 and asked PayPal for financial assistance. PayPal agreed to stop all arrears 
collections activity on the account for a period of three months, until July 2020, to give Mr C 
the opportunity to recover his financial position and clear the outstanding arrears.
At the end of the three-month hold period the arrears on Mr Cs account had increased. In 
November 2020, when Mr C tried to log into his PayPal account, he discovered that the 
account had been restricted. Mr C wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint 
PayPal looked at Mr Cs complaint. They noted that theyd given Mr C the three-month 
collections hold to clear the arrears on his account, but that rather than the arrears being 
cleared, the arrears amount had grown during that period. As such, PayPal didnt feel that 
theyd acted unfairly by restricting Mr Cs account because of the unpaid arrears following 
the collections hold period, and so they didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they felt that PayPal had provided 
financial assistance to Mr C by suspending collections activity on his account for three 
months, and that because Mr C hadnt cleared the arrears within those three months that it 
hadnt been unreasonable for PayPal to have then suspended Mr Cs account at the end of 
the hold period because of those outstanding arrears.
Mr C remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In his correspondence with this service, Mr C has noted that when he asked PayPal for 
financial assistance in April 2020, that he informed PayPal that he was struggling financially 
at that time because of the financial impact of Covid-19. Mr C has also asked whether this 
should have meant that PayPal should have offered some form of financial assistance 
tailored for Covid-19.
It may be the case that Mr C is referring here to temporary guidance published by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in April 2020 which prescribed that many financial 
businesses should provide three-month payment holidays to eligible customers who were 
struggling financially at that time because of the impact of Covid-19. However, considering 
this guidance, I dont feel that it applies to PayPal accounts such as the account that Mr C 
held, and so it follows that I dont feel that PayPal should have offered the type of payment 
holiday as described by the FCA in the temporary guidance.
This doesnt mean that PayPal shouldnt have considered offering Mr C some form of 
financial assistance at that time, and indeed, having been informed by Mr C that he was 
struggling financially, it would be expected by this service, in consideration of existing 
standards of practice, that PayPal would have acted positively and sympathetically towards 
Mr Cs position and offered financial assistance appropriate for that position.
I think that PayPal did that here. They explained to Mr C that they would be willing to place a 
collections hold on his account for a period of three months so as to allow Mr C the 
opportunity to recover his financial position and clear the outstanding arrears on his account.
Mr C contends that he stayed in touch with PayPal via email and updated them as to his 
ongoing financial circumstances in the time up until July 2020, when the three-month 
collections hold ended. But PayPal dont have any record of any updates or contact received 
from Mr C during this time, and Mr C has confirmed that hes unable to provide any copies of 
this email correspondence. 
It may have been the case that Mr Cs financial position was such that he should have been 
offered continuing financial assistance from PayPal following the end of the collections hold 
period. But in the absence of evidence of continuing contact from Mr C, I wouldnt have 
expected PayPal to have proactively implemented any continuing form of assistance and so 
find it difficult to conclude that PayPal acted unfairly towards Mr C by choosing to restrict his 
account because of the continuing outstanding arrears.
Mr C has also stated that the arrears accrued on his account because PayPal allowed 
requests for reimbursements made by customers of Mr C to be processed without notifying 
Mr C or giving him the opportunity to respond. However, PayPal have been able to 
demonstrate that they sent notifications informing Mr C of these reimbursement requests, 
and that Mr C didnt respond to these notifications within the time frames required of him.
Finally, its evident from the account terms, including PayPals User Agreement, that PayPal 
werent acting out of accordance with those terms by restricting Mr Cs account on the basis 
of outstanding arrears as they did. And, while I acknowledge that it would have been 
preferable for PayPal to have written to Mr C at the end of the collections hold period in July 
2020 and confirmed that collections activity would now commence, and that this may result 
in Mr Cs account being restricted, it remains the case that Mr C was informed at the time 
that the three-month collections hold was agreed when that collections hold would end.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and I say this because Im satisfied that PayPal did offer appropriate 
financial assistance to Mr C when he requested it in the form of a hold on arrears collection 
activities. And, following the end of that hold, given that Mr Cs account had fallen further into 
arrears, I dont feel that PayPal acted unfairly by restricting Mr Cs account in the manner 
that they did.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr C was wanting, but it follows that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any further action at this time. I trust 
that Mr C will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I 
have.My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2022.
