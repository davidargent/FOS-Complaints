K821x#15complaint
Ms H, through her representative,  says Oasis Personal Credit  Limited  (Oasis) lent to her 
irresponsibly. She says she suffered severe  financial  hardship  as a result  of inaccurate 
affordability assessments and was caught in a spiral of debt, starting over 15 years ago. 
Ms H also says she was vulnerable and dependent on benefits for her income.
background
I sent Ms H and Oasis  my provisional findings on this complaint on 11 December 2019. A 
copy of my provisional decision is attached and forms  part of this final decision.  In it, 
I explained why I was planning  to uphold this complaint in part and asked both parties to let 
me know if they had anything to add.
Ms H didnt send me anything else to consider. Oasis  did respond,  making a number  of 
points, which  Ive read in full and have summarised  below.
I hadnt taken  account of everything Oasis had provided, including information about 
how it issues its loans.
Although it is true that Oasis lent to Ms H 52 times in six years, she didnt have 52 
individual loans  but four separate agreements which were continually  renewed.
Ms H never missed  a payment and never  said she was struggling.  The lending was 
based solely on what Ms H told Oasis.
From  November  2016 Ms H only had two active loan facilities because  she didnt 
renew two of the four available to her.
Ive considered everything Oasis said in response  to my provisional decision, as well as 
everything previously provided  and have set out my final findings below.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account our general 
approach (as set out on our website)  to complaints about irresponsible lending - including  all 
of the relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry practice.
Id like to start by reassuring Oasis that Ive read everything it has submitted. I havent  
disregarded, or overlooked, any of the information  it has provided about the way in which  it 
lent to Ms H. When I said Ive seen little evidence of when repayments were made in my 
provisional decision, I meant that I hadnt seen a full transaction history for each  loan which 
may have  provided  information such as when each  instalment was paid, the size of the 
instalment and whether the instalment was paid on time  but I was of course  aware of some  
details, such as when  most of the loans were  fully repaid. 
For some  of the loans,  the format of the information Oasis provided made it difficult to tell the 
end date of each individual advance  although this didnt affect my ability  to make a fair 
decision. I am grateful to Oasis for its submissions following  my provisional decision,  which  
included information  in a different format which makes the repayment  date of each advance 
clearer.
Having said this, Oasis  submissions havent  changed my provisional findings  and Ill 
explain why.
Ref: DRN94488702Oasis has emphasised that Ms H only had four loan agreements with it and these  could be 
renewed by her. Ultimately, however Ms Hs accounts with Oasis were  arranged, her 
complaint is about  Oasis  decisions to lend to her. And theres  no real dispute here about the 
number of loans  (or lending decisions) in this case. So Im afraid that this point is purely 
about semantics and has no bearing on the outcome  of Ms Hs case.  An agreement which 
has been renewed isnt really any different to providing a new loan.
Oasis says Ms H never told it she was struggling and so it didnt see any reason not to 
renew her loans. As I mentioned in my provisional decision, Oasis  hasnt provided any 
information to show it assessed whether the loans were sustainably  affordable  for Ms H. The 
regulator requires  Oasis to make  this assessment and to do so in a proportionate manner. 
Without any information to demonstrate Oasis actually carried  out any kind of assessment  of 
Ms Hs income and expenditure, I was unable to say whether or not any of the affordability  
checks it carried out were proportionate.
What Oasis has said it did before lending was to rely on Ms Hs declared income and 
expenditure. Given how long Oasis lent to Mr H without break,  I do not think relying solely  on 
Ms Hs declared income and expenditure was proportionate for any of the loans I am 
considering. But equally, as I explained,  I dont have any information from Ms H to show  
loans 1 to 6 were  not affordable. And, with the information available to me, theres  also not 
enough to say whether the pattern of borrowing during this time demonstrated the lending 
wasnt sustainably affordable for Ms H.
By loan 7, I thought Oasis couldve seen, from the pattern of borrowing,  that it was unlikely 
Ms H was repaying the loans sustainably. In other words, it didnt really need Ms H to tell it 
she was in difficulty to know  that this was likely  to be the case. Her need to borrow so 
frequently was a sign that her loans  were not sustainably affordable. And had Oasis  carried 
out proportionate checks for these loans I think it wouldve seen further evidence of this. As 
I said, Ms Hs credit  history suggested a long-term unsustainable reliance on high-cost and 
home credit and I think that sort of information couldve been easily obtained by Oasis.
So for the reasons given above  and in my provisional decision, Im partially upholding 
Ms Hs complaint.
putting things right
Oasis should  refund all the interest  and charges  Ms H paid on the loans approved 
from September 2012 onwards and;
add to the refund interest at 8% simple per year, from when Ms H paid the interest 
and charges, until the date of settlement
the sheer number  of loans provided is likely in itself to be viewed as having an 
adverse credit history, so if Oasis  has reported  the loans to credit  references 
agencies, it should remove them
I understand Ms H also has outstanding loans. For these loans, Oasis should remove any 
interest and charges applied from the outset  and treat any payments made  as if they were 
payments towards  the principal. It can then deduct any unpaid principal remaining from the 
net of the above redress.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Oasis to take off tax from this interest. Oasis must give Ms H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN94488703my final decision
I uphold Ms Hs complaint  in part. Oasis Personal Credit Limited must put things right by 
taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2020.

complaint
Ms H, through  her representative,  says Oasis Personal Credit Limited  (Oasis) lent to her 
irresponsibly. She says she suffered severe financial hardship as a result  of inaccurate affordability 
assessments and was caught in a spiral  of debt, starting over 15 years ago. Ms H also says she was 
vulnerable and dependent on benefits for her income.
background
Ive set out a summary of the lending  from January 2012 onwards at the end of this decision. 
I understand that there was lending  before  2012 this going back to at least 2007 and possibly earlier 
(although complaints about events  which  happened before 6 April 2007 are not within our jurisdiction). 
However, as neither party appears  to have any information relating to the lending  between  April 2007 
and January 2012, I am restricting my decision to events occurring in and after January  2012. Our 
adjudicator took the same  approach and no objections  were raised by either party.
In its earliest submissions to this service, Oasis said:
Ms H has been its customer  for about 15 years,  only ever missed the odd payment  and was 
on the whole an excellent  customer
Oasis always asked  Ms H about the affordability of the loans
Ms H didnt tell Oasis  about her loans with other  home credit lenders
Had Oasis known  about  her other  debts, it wouldnt have lent to her
Two views were sent to both parties  the first in May 2018 and the second in November  2019. Both 
of these views proposed Ms Hs complaint be largely upheld. The most  recent adjudicator  suggested 
the complaint should be upheld in respect of the fourth loan approved in May 2012 and all subsequent  
loans. Oasis didnt accept that opinion  and so the complaint was passed  to me to decide. Ive 
summarised some  of the further points  Oasis made below:
All appropriate affordability  checks were carried out and Ms H had a good repayment history 
(although Oasis cannot provide any evidence of checks as the relevant paperwork was water 
damaged)
The debts Ms H had with Oasis were of relatively small value compared  with other lenders
Ms H made her complaint  only six days after taking out her last loan
Ms Hs repayments were made on time and there was no indication she was in financial  
difficulty
Ms H only had four active loans  at any given  point
As no agreement was reached, Ms Hs complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about 
irresponsible lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website. 
Oasis needed to take reasonable  steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Ms H could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN94488705But certain factors might  point to the fact that Oasis should fairly and reasonably  have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Oasis  was required to establish whether Ms H 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Hs complaint.
As I summarised above, Oasis isnt able to provide any evidence of having carried out affordability 
checks before lending to Ms H. It says that the relevant  paperwork was damaged or destroyed. In 
these circumstances  I am unable to say that Oasis  carried out the proportionate affordability checks  
Id have expected to see for any of the loans it provided  to Ms H.
Id usually  therefore go on to recreate proportionate checks for the earlier loans Oasis provided to 
Ms H, to decide what such checks would  likely have shown. But I do not have sufficient information to 
do this either, as Ms H also cannot provide evidence  of her income  and expenditure  dating  back to 
2012.
So, for the earlier loans, I cannot say whether proportionate checks  wouldve shown  them to be 
unaffordable for Ms H. I therefore do not intend to uphold  Ms Hs complaint in respect of some of her 
earlier loans.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Oasis lending  history with Ms H, with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which  Oasis should reasonably  have  seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so Oasis should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further 
loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Hs case  including the number of times Oasis  lent to Ms H 
and the period of time over which it lent  I think such  a point did arise and that this happened when  
Ms H asked for the loan Ive referred to as loan 7 in my table.
I think  by this point Oasis ought to have realised Ms H wasnt likely  to be managing her loans 
sustainably. I understand Oasis point that Ms H nearly always made her payments on time (although 
Ref: DRN94488706Ive seen little evidence of when repayments  were made)  but I do not accept that this means  
repayments were always made sustainably. As Ive said above,  the concept of sustainability includes  
repayments being made  without undue difficulty and without the need to borrow  again. Yet from the 
information Oasis has provided, it lent to Ms H at least 52 times in a period  of less than six years   
and Oasis accepts  there was in fact lending over 15 years. Focussing on the lending from 2012, this 
means Oasis lent to Ms H only a little less than once a month on average,  for just under  six years.  
The amounts vary but were  typically between £400 and £600 each time.
Taking together the lack of variance in the amounts lent and the sheer  number  of loans, it looks like 
Ms H was reliant on the credit being provided, likely  because repaying  the loans left a hole in her 
finances which meant  she repeatedly had to borrow  again to fill the gap. I think this strongly  suggests 
her repayments were  not made  without  undue difficulty or without the need to borrow  again.
From what Oasis has said, it seems that it always  relied entirely on Ms Hs declared income and 
expenditure. As Ive suggested above, that may have been proportionate for loans 1 to 6. But I do not 
think it was proportionate  to continue to do this after this point. Ms Hs repeated need to borrow again  
ought to have  caused Oasis  to look more  closely  at her financial situation  and sought to 
independently verify her other  credit commitments  for example by using  credit bureau data. Ive 
seen no evidence it did this. Had Oasis done this, I think it wouldve seen further evidence  of Ms H 
having a harmful and unsustainable reliance on home credit. A credit report  provided by Ms H  which  
covers a period of six years  shows that shed  accessed home credit at least  an additional 46 times, 
from other lenders, in that timeframe. Oasis has already conceded that had it known  about Ms Hs 
other debts,  it wouldnt have lent to her. From what Ive seen, I think  if Oasis had carried  out 
proportionate checks for loan 7 onwards, it would  have known  about those other debts.
Oasis continued to provide expensive  credit  for a significant amount of time after loan 7. And Ms H 
ended up paying large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service to Oasis over an extended period.  So I 
think Ms H lost out because of what Oasis  did wrong.
For these  reasons, I intend to uphold  Ms Hs complaint about loans 7 to 52. Or to put it another  way, 
in respect of all the lending that took place  from and including September  2012 onwards.
putting things  right
I plan to tell Oasis to put things right as follows:
refund all the interest and charges  Ms H paid on the loans approved from September  2012 
onwards
add to the refund interest at 8% simple per year, from when Ms H paid the interest and 
charges, until the date of settlement
the sheer number of loans  provided  is likely in itself to be viewed  as an adverse  credit history, 
so if Oasis has reported  the loans to credit references agencies, it should remove them
I understand Ms H also has outstanding  loans. So for these, Oasis should  remove any interest  and 
charges applied  from the outset and treat any payments made  as if they were payments towards the 
principal. It can then deduct any unpaid  principal remaining from the net of the above redress.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Oasis to take off tax from this interest. Oasis must give Ms H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.

I plan to uphold Ms Hs complaint in part and to tell Oasis Personal Credit Limited to put things right 
by taking the steps  set out above.
Ref: DRN94488707Appendix
Below is a brief summary of Ms Hs borrowing, based on information provided by Oasis. Parts of this 
table were included in the adjudicators view and Oasis hasnt suggested that any of the information  in 
it is incorrect. So it is my understanding that Oasis lent to Ms H 52 times between  January  2012 and 
October 2017. I am unclear on the exact end date of each loan and so have not included this 
information in the table. As far as was possible, I have cross-referenced the information  below with 
the loan agreements Oasis provided   but as these are handwritten and as some have also been 
scanned incorrectly, I have not been able to cross-reference the date of loan information  for about  
seven of the loans. This hasnt affected  my ability  to reach a fair decision in Ms Hs case.
