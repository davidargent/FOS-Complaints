Our adjudicator upheld  Mr As complaint in part and thought the loans from 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Quick Quid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN65244612But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, it seems  that the checks Quick  Quid  carried out on loans 1 to 4 
were proportionate. And although they thought  Quick Quid  shouldve  carried  out more in 
depth checks on loans  5 and 6 to see if they were  affordable for Mr A, they didnt see 
anything to suggest that they were unaffordable  for him. As neither Quick Quid  nor Mr A 
have disputed the adjudicators findings about these loans, I wont  comment any further on 
them.
As well as considering  if the checks Quick Quid carried out were proportionate, Ive also 
looked at the overall pattern of Quick Quids lending history with Mr A, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  where Quick Quid should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Quick Quid should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
Loan 7. I say this because:
By loan 7 Mr A had been borrowing money from Quick  Quid for over 15 months and 
had regularly topped up the amounts  hed borrowed each time, indicating that he 
wasnt able to repay the loans sustainably;
Ref: DRN65244613From  loan 7 onwards  Mr A was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one. So Quick Quid ought  to have realised each time Mr A borrowed more 
that it was more likely than not Mr A was having  to borrow  further  to cover the hole 
left in his finances  caused by repaying his previous loan and that Mr As 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr A incurred  late fees on loans 9a, 12b and 13c which were further signs  that Mr A 
mayve been struggling to repay  the loans as they fell due, yet Quick  Quid  continued 
to lend to Mr A after each occasion.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Quick Quid. Loan 14b 
was taken out over 2 years after M As first loan.  And the amounts he was borrowing 
were similar throughout, which meant  Mr A had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Quick  Quid over an extended period of time.
I think that Mr A lost out because Quick Quid continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr As ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  Loans  7 onwards and therefore Quick  Quid  should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Quick Quid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 7 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 7 and onwards should be removed  
from Mr As credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest.  Quick Quid  must give 
Mr A a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Because of the reasons  given above, I uphold  this complaint in part and require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to do what I have said above to put matters  right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
