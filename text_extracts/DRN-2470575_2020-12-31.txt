The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) is asking him to repay a 
loan that he cancelled in 2018. 
What happened
Mr C applied for a £2,500 loan with NatWest in 2018 and the funds were credited to his 
current account. Mr C cancelled the loan and the transaction was reversed five days later. 
Mr C complained that the loan has recently appeared when he logs into his online banking 
and that it states he now owes over £4,000, despite him having cancelled the loan. NatWest 
initially agreed that the loan hadnt shown on his online banking and paid him £50 
compensation to reflect the distress and inconvenience caused.
During our investigation of the complaint, NatWest discovered that it had made an error  it 
had accidentally recredited Mr Cs current account with the loan funds in May 2018. NatWest 
said that Mr C has had the benefit of the funds, which have now been spent, and will need to 
repay these. But it says it will remove any interest added to the loan and it has requested for 
the account to be removed from Mr Cs credit report  although it states that no adverse 
information had been recorded in any case. And it said that if Mr C couldnt afford to repay 
the loan as a lump sum, it would work with him to repay this at a rate he could afford.
Our investigator thought the offer made by NatWest was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances  and that Mr C would need to discuss a possible repayment plan directly 
with NatWest. But Mr C disagreed and said that he thought the loan should be written off as 
he had cancelled it, and this was NatWests error. And he thought he should be paid 
compensation for the distress caused to him and the effect on his mental health.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator and for the same 
reasons.
There is no dispute here that NatWest made an error in recrediting the account with the loan 
funds but what is in dispute, is how NatWest needs to put things right.
Mr C doesnt think he should have to repay the funds. But I have seen that these funds were 
credited to his account and that Mr C spent them, so I think Mr C has had the benefit of the 
money  and therefore I think its fair that he repays this money.
NatWest has agreed that there will be no interest charged on these funds so he will only 
need to repay the £2,500 credited to his account  so Mr C has had the benefit of having 
received the loan funds without them attracting any interest. As this was NatWests error, I 
agree that it shouldnt apply interest to the £2,500 and it should allow Mr C to repay the 
funds interest-free.
Mr C has said that he should be compensated for NatWests error and I have considered 
this. He states that this has affected his mental health, that he cant afford to repay the funds 
and that it has affected his credit report. However NatWest has confirmed that it hasnt 
reported any adverse data in relation to this loan. 
I also have to consider that Mr C says he only became aware of the loan in May 2019 when 
it appeared on his online banking and that he has had the benefit of the money for two years 
without making any repayments. And I can see that these funds repaid Mr Cs overdraft at 
the time, so he has had the benefit of that. NatWest has also previously paid Mr C £50 
compensation in respect of this complaint for its error in the account not showing on his 
online banking. So taking everything NatWest has offered into account, I think the offer it has 
made fairly reflects the distress caused and I dont think NatWest needs to pay any further 
compensation in this instance.
However I do think NatWest needs to ensure that it arranges a repayment plan that is 
affordable for Mr C  as it has offered to. Mr C will need to complete an affordability planner 
and discuss what he can afford with NatWest. NatWest should then allow Mr C to repay the 
funds at a rate that is affordable to him  even if Mr C is only able to afford nominal 
payments. This plan shouldnt show on Mr Cs credit file as it has suggested as Mr C 
intended to cancel the loan and only owes these funds now due to NatWests error.
Mr C has said that he will struggle to repay the funds without incurring financial hardship  
and NatWest must take that into account when arranging to repayment plan. Should Mr C 
need any assistance with this then NatWest should provide him with contact details for debt 
charities to ensure he is able to afford any repayments.
Putting things right
NatWest should:
allow Mr C to repay the funds without incurring interest
repay the funds at a rate that is affordable to him based on an affordability 
assessment
not record any information about this debt on his credit file
if it hasnt done so already, it should pay him the £50 it previously offered in its final 
response letter
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. National Westminster Bank Plc 
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2021.
