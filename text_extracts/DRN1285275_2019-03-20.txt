K820x#14complaint
Mr O complains that his National Westminster Bank Plc phone application (app)  incorrectly  
made a payment twice. Mr O also complains that NatWest  hasnt  been  able to get the 
second payment  back. 
background
On 8 June 2018 Mr O visited a NatWest  branch  and got advice about  how to make  an 
international payment on his phone app. Two international  payments for Â£770 were made 
from Mr Os account  but the second  transaction was an error. 
Mr O quickly asked NatWest to get the second  payment back.  NatWest  contacted  the 
receiving bank and asked for the money back but hasnt been  successful.  
Mr O complained but NatWest didnt  agree  it had made a mistake  and said hed made two 
payments, around  30 seconds apart.  NatWest  suggested there may have been an issue  with 
Mr Os internet connection that affected  how the payments were made. As NatWest didnt 
refund the missing  payment  or uphold Mr Os complaint he referred it to this service.  An 
investigator looked at Mr Os complaint but said he thought two payments couldve been  
processed using  the phone  app in around 30 seconds and that NatWest  had tried its best to 
retrieve the missing payment. 
Mr O didnt accept the investigators  view and asked for his complaint to be appealed so its 
been passed to me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive set out the background to Mr Os 
complaint in brief above as all parties  broadly agree on what happened.  I want to assure 
Mr O and NatWest  that in reaching my decision Ive considered everything thats been 
supplied. 
One of the key issues for Mr Os complaint concerns how long it takes to process an 
international payment using NatWests phone  app. Mr O says there  are five separate steps 
and it takes longer than 30 seconds  to complete.  But NatWest  have sent evidence  of how 
the phone  app is used to make international payments. I agree that there are several steps 
but from what Ive seen I think its possible to make  two different international payments 
around 30 seconds apart. 
NatWests also confirmed  that it didnt experience problems making international payments 
on 8 June 2018. NatWest also suggested  that Mr O mayve experienced a problem with his 
internet while  trying  to make the first payment. I cant say whether thats the case and I 
believe Mr Os claim that he only wanted  to make one payment on 8 June 2018. But I 
havent found that it was an error  by NatWest which caused the payment to be made  twice.  
I think its important to note that whilst the payments  were made  around  30 seconds apart 
they werent duplicates.  NatWest has sent evidence to show  each payment had a unique 
reference number  and Im satisfied they were separate transactions. Im sorry to disappoint 
Ref: DRN12852752Mr O but Im not persuaded that a technical fault or error by NatWest meant his payment 
was made  twice. 
NatWest quickly contacted the receiving bank to try and get Mr Os money back. Ive looked 
at the messages and emails sent by NatWest and can see its been actively trying to get 
Mr Os money  back since June 2018.  Im satisfied  its taken reasonable steps to retrieve 
Mr Os money.  
I know this will come as a disappointment for Mr O but, for the reasons Ive given above, Im 
satisfied NatWest wasnt responsible for the payment  leaving his account twice in 
June 2018. And I think NatWest has made  reasonable attempts to get Mr Os funds  back 
from the receiving bank. As a result, Im not telling NatWest to take any further action to 
resolve Mr Os complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2019.
