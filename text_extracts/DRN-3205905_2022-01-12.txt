The complaint
Mr S believes MotoNovo Finance Limited acted irresponsibly by a hire purchase agreement 
hed applied for.
What happened
On 12 January 2016, Mr S took out a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo, to fund the 
purchase of a used car. The agreement was for £13,000 over 49 months, with 48 monthly 
repayments of £248.58 and a final payment of £5,427.50.
Mr S has complained MotoNovo didnt act responsibly when approving the hire purchase 
agreement. He said it was unaffordable and that MotoNovo didnt take into consideration 
previous missed payments or that he wasnt starting a new job until February 2016. Mr S 
also complained that the final payment wasnt explained to him, that he wasnt able to 
refinance this payment, and that hed been forced into taking the agreement by being told to 
just sign the documents.
MotoNovo thought theyd acted reasonably when approving the agreement. Mr S wasnt 
happy with this, and he brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said that MotoNovo had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks 
when they approved the agreement. And it was affordable for Mr S at the time he took it out, 
with no indications that this affordability wouldnt be sustainable over the lifetime of the 
agreement. 
The investigator also said that requirement to make the final payment was detailed in the 
agreement, so he was satisfied that Mr S was fully aware of this, especially as he asked 
MotoNovo about the possibility of refinancing this. He didnt think that the agreement Mr S 
signed required MotoNovo to refinance the final payment, and he hadnt seen anything to 
show him that Mr S was forced to take the agreement. So, he didnt think MotoNovo had 
done anything wrong.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigator. He said he wasnt working at the time the agreement 
was taken out and he provided a copy of a Leavers Questionnaire and Exit Interview form, 
from his employer, which said his employment finished on 23 December 2015. And hes also 
said that MotoNovo didnt sign a copy of the agreement.
Because Mr S didnt agree with the investigator, this matter has been passed to me to make 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When someone complains about irresponsible and/or unaffordable lending, there are two 
overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint. These are:
1. Did MotoNovo complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr 
S would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did MotoNovo make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mr S 
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did MotoNovo act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, if I determine that MotoNovo didnt act fairly and reasonably when considering Mr Ss 
application, Ill also consider what I think is a fair way to put things right.
Did MotoNovo complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr S 
would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
Theres no set list for what reasonable and proportionate checks are, but Id expect lenders 
to consider things such as the amount, duration and payments of the finance being applied 
for; as well as the borrowers personal circumstances at the time of each application. 
Ive seen a copy of the credit search that MotoNovo did as part of Mr Ss application. This 
shows that Mr S owed a total of £1,234 across two credit cards and a mail order account. It 
also showed that he owed £9,976 on a hire purchase agreement, although the monthly 
payment for this agreement isnt showing.
The credit search also showed that Mr S was paying £88 a month to a public utility. Which 
would most likely be his energy bills. There were no defaults, county court judgements, or 
missed payments on any credit agreements showing. And the credit search also showed 
that Mr Ss current account was conducted within his agreed overdraft limit.
MotoNovo have said that, at the time of Mr Ss application, they had no regulatory 
requirement to verify income. While this may have been the case, Id still consider checking 
the income and expenditure to be a reasonable part of any checking whether a loan would 
be affordable or not.
MotoNovo have said that, at the time of the application, Mr S declared he was a team leader 
at a firm of solicitors and had been there six years. Im aware that Mr S has provided 
information to show that hed left his employment in December 2015, and hes said that he 
didnt start his new employment until February 2016. But I havent seen anything to show me 
that he made MotoNovo aware of this. So, I think it was reasonable for MotoNovo to assess 
the application based on the information theyd been provided with.
While MotoNovo didnt confirm Mr Ss income theyve said that, given the job and length of 
employment, theyd assumed this would be no less than £20,000 a year, which would give 
Mr S a take home pay of £1,400 a month.
Assuming the hire purchase payment was something similar to what Mr S would be paying 
to MotoNovo, and that he paid 5% of the credit card and mail order balances each month, 
this would give him £1,088.30 disposable income each month to pay rent, any other 
outgoings and MotoNovos payment of £248.58. MotoNovo say theyd calculated Mr Ss 
monthly disposable income to be £1,100, and determined the finance was affordable on this 
basis.Did MotoNovo make a fair lending decision?
Im aware that Mr S thinks the finance shouldnt have been approved, as it wasnt affordable. 
And hes said that he was only able to support the payments by borrowing money. Mr S has 
been given the opportunity to provide bank statements to support this, but he hasnt provided 
any. As such, my decision will be based on the information thats available to me.
The finance agreement started in January 2016, and Mr S maintained all payments until 
August 2016. The payment for September 2016 was missed, and Mr S told MotoNovo this 
was because hed been off work ill. And he came to an arrangement to pay this back over 
three months. The explanation for the missed payment Mr S provided at the time doesnt 
indicate that the finance wasnt affordable to him when it was approved.
On November 2018, Mr S contacted MotoNovo to say that he wouldnt be able to pay the 
December 2018 payment. The explanation he gave to MotoNovo at the time was because 
hed had to pay out to repair the car at a time where he had additional costs of moving 
home. And he offered to pay MotoNovo an additional £40 a month from January 2019 to 
repay the missed payment. Again, the explanation for the missed payment provided by Mr S 
doesnt indicate that the finance was unaffordable to him in January 2016.
MotoNovo spoke to Mr S about his income and expenditure, after which they agreed a 
payment arrangement of an additional £30 a month payment to repay the December 2018 
missed payment. Im satisfied that, if the finance wasnt affordable to Mr S, then this 
wouldve showed at this time the income and expenditure calculation was carried out. But, 
not only did this show that Mr S was able to afford the monthly payment, it also showed that 
he could afford an additional payment on top to clear the arrears.
Its not disputed that Mr S had financial difficulties from mid-2019 onwards. Or that these 
were caused by him being signed off for work due to stress and anxiety. But this isnt 
something MotoNovo couldve reasonably anticipated. And I dont think this means that 
MotoNovo shouldnt have approved the finance in January 2016.
So, given the above, Im satisfied that MotoNovo made a fair lending decision in January 
2016, and theres nothing to indicate that this wasnt affordable to Mr S at the time.
Did MotoNovo act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Mr S has said that the final payment wasnt explained to him. This shouldve been explained 
to him by the dealership, who would also have been responsible for explaining any 
alternative options. And, its not possible for me to say what was or wasnt discussed at the 
time. But Ive seen that MotoNovo made it clear in the agreement that there was a final 
payment of £5,427.50. And I havent seen anything in the agreement that indicates that 
MotoNovo advised Mr S on the suitability of the finance. So, I dont think that MotoNovo 
have done anything wrong.
Ive also seen that Mr S also called MotoNovo on 24 April 2019, asking about his options for 
returning the car. He explained that hed been declined for finance when he tried to part-
exchange it. He also asked about his options for refinancing the final payment, as he 
wouldnt be able to afford to pay this as a single payment. So, Im satisfied that Mr S was 
fully aware of the terms of the final payment, and how and when it needed to be paid.
After the agreement had ended, Mr S contacted MotoNovo about the final payment. And Ive 
seen that, on 11 March 2020, MotoNovo explained to him that they could refinance the final 
payment, but they would need him to clear his arrears of £2,252.26 arrears first. I dont consider this to be unreasonable  refinancing the final payment would be a new agreement, 
And MotoNovo have said they cant do this while Mr S would still owed money (the arrears) 
under the original agreement. So, I dont think that MotoNovo need to refinance the final 
payment.
Mr S has also raised the issue that MotoNovo never signed the agreement. As I understand 
it, this is an argument of the enforceability of the agreement. Enforceability is a legal matter, 
and is something for the courts to decide, not ourselves. So, this is something Mr S needs to 
consider taking independent legal advice about.
Given the above, I havent seen anything to make me think MotoNovo acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in some other way.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint about MotoNovo Finance 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2022.
