Mr P says that Sunny didnt carry out adequate affordability checks before providing the 
loans. He said that he couldnt afford to make the repayments and he fell behind on his rent 
and council tax as a result.
Sunny said it carried out adequate creditworthiness and affordability checks before the loans 
were provided and that the repayments were affordable for Mr P. 
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans 5 to 16.
Sunny provided a counter offer following our adjudicators view. It offered to partially uphold 
this complaint from loan 12 onwards. Mr P didnt accept Sunnys offer.As a resolution hasnt been agreed this complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold this complaint in regard to the first four loans. As neither party 
has disputed this I havent considered these loans further. I have included them in my overall 
assessment of Mr Ps borrowing from Sunny.
Before loan 5 was provided, information about Mr Ps income and expenses was gathered. 
Mr Ps monthly income was recorded as £2,200 (and had been this amount since the start of 
the lending relationship). Mr Ps monthly disposable income was recorded as £391 however his monthly expenses were recorded as just under £2,000 which would leave a monthly 
disposable income of just over £200. 
Loan 5 was taken out before the first three loans had been repaid and a few days after the 
fourth loan was repaid. It was the fifth loan within just over two months. I think this suggests 
that Mr P was having difficulty in managing his money. He was not repaying existing debt 
before taking out new debt and when he did make a repayment he then borrowed the same 
amount a few days later. This suggests he needed to borrow to fill the hole left in his 
finances by the previous loan repayment.
I note Sunnys comments about how its product works and that up to four loans can be take 
out at any one time to allow flexibility over the amount a customer borrows at any one time. I 
also note the comments about all other credit commitments being taken into account before 
a new loan is provided. However by loan 5, Mr P had loans with an original capital value of 
£1,000 outstanding. Total monthly repayments were around £316. Had this amount of 
borrowing been taken out in a single loan at the outset it wouldnt have been affordable 
based on Mr Ps disposable income. So while I understand the points made by Sunny, in 
this case, I think the increase in the amount Mr P was borrowing should have rasied 
concerns.
Overall, by loan 5, I think Sunny should have realised that Mr P was struggling to managing 
his money and that it was unlikely that he was able to sustainably afford his repayments.
Mr P repaid a number of loans on 1 September but then borrowed again a few days later. 
And around a month later he had borrowed £850 across four loans showing that he was 
continuing to have difficulties managing his money.
By loan 10, Mr P had taken out 10 loans in six months and for the majority of this period he 
had the maximum amount of four loans outstanding. His loans werent showing a pattern of 
reduction suggesting that Mr Ps situation wasnt improving and that he remained reliant on 
these loans. By Loan 10, Mr P had, on two occasions, repaid his borrowing and taken out 
new loans shortly after.  He then took out loan 10 the same day as repaying loan 7 and while 
other loans remained outstanding. I think that Mr Ps pattern of borrowing shows the loans 
werent sustainably affordable for him.
Overall I uphold this complaint in regard to loans 5 onwards. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 5 to16; 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans 5 to 9 from Mr Ps credit file. The 
overall pattern of Mr Ps borrowing for loans 10 through to 16 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so these should be removed entirely from Mr Ps 
credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr P a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
 
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr P compensation as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2020.
