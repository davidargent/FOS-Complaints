The complaint
Mr L is complaining that he wasnt able to deposit a cheque into his Lloyds Bank PLC bank 
account using the mobile app. Hes unhappy he had to go to a Lloyds branch to do so.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr L feels strongly that Lloyds has treated him unfairly, but I havent seen 
anything to show it has. Lloyds provides the option for its customers to deposit cheques 
using the mobile app. But it doesnt guarantee that this will be possible every time.
I havent seen anything to show that it was a fault with the app itself that meant Mr L was 
unable to use to deposit the cheque. Lloyds has set out that the system shows that the issue 
was because the date on the cheque wasnt clear enough. Im persuaded that this was the 
most likely reason and Mr L hasnt given me anything to show that wasnt the case. Lloyds 
isnt responsible for this, so I cant reasonably say that its acted unfairly.
I note Mr L has said hes unhappy Lloyds only gave him the option to go to a branch to 
deposit the cheque and has set out that there were other options available that were more 
suitable. But, even if I think Lloyds needed to do more to assist Mr L, its paid him £10 to 
cover his expenses in having to deposit the cheque. So I dont think Mr L is out of pocket.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, its my final decision that I think Lloyds Bank PLCs offer 
to pay Mr L £10 to cover his expenses is fair. It should pay this to him directly if it hasnt 
already done so. I make no further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 June 2023.
