The complaint
Miss M complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss M under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that she electronically signed in December 2016. She says that there were some 
issues with the car so it was returned to the dealer four times within the first three months. 
She complained to MotoNovo Finance about the issues with the car in June 2018 and in 
January 2019 but it said that it would require evidence that the faults were present at the 
point of sale. She complained to MotoNovo Finance in October 2020 and then complained to 
this service in June 2021.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Miss Ms complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Miss M had had the car for over 18 months and had driven 14,884 miles in it when she first 
complained to MotoNovo Finance and she didnt think that the issues were present at 
finance inception and she was unable to conclude that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality 
at the point of supply. She said that MotoNovo Finance had terminated the agreement and 
recommended that Miss M contacted it about the amount that she owed it under the 
agreement and to agree an affordable repayment arrangement.
Miss M has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has 
responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that: 
the car wasnt of satisfactory quality and was mis-sold under the Consumers Rights 
Act 2015 and the dealer failed to fix the problems with it so she made many 
complaints to MotoNovo Finance which it ignored or dealt with poorly;
she stopped making payments in 2018 and has only been contacted once since then 
about her payments but she was unable to finance another car so had to rent a car 
because she needed a car for work which has cost her thousands of pounds;
the car could have been in an accident which was not reported or identified at 
purchase and work had already been done to the car which wasnt completed to a 
high standard and there were snapped bolts in the engine which were found through 
diagnostic testing; and
she had an independent engineers report completed on the car  but she doesnt 
have a copy of the report as she understood that it was going to be sent to MotoNovo 
Finance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss M was more than six years old, had been driven for 
37,000 miles and had a price of £8,995;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Miss M says that there were some issues with the car so it was returned to the dealer 
four times within the first three months  but the car had passed an MOT test in 
December 2016 before it was supplied to her;
she didnt complain to MotoNovo Finance about the issues with the car until June 
2018  about 18 months after the car was supplied to her  and the car had passed 
an MOT test in January 2018 when its mileage was recorded as 51,810 miles  so in 
the first year after the car was supplied to Miss M shed been able to drive nearly 
15,000 miles in it;
MotoNovo Finance said that it would require evidence that the faults were present at 
the point of sale but Ive seen no evidence to show that Miss M provided that 
evidence to MotoNovo Finance  she says that she had an independent engineers 
report completed on the car but Ive not been provided with a copy of that report by 
Miss M or MotoNovo Finance;
the car passed an MOT test in November 2019 when its mileage was recorded as 
54,995 miles but the cars MOT certificate has now expired, Miss M says that she 
hasnt used the car and she stopped making payments to MotoNovo Finance in 
2018;
there may have been some faults with the car when it was supplied to Miss M but Im 
not persuaded that shes provided enough evidence to show that those faults were 
enough to cause a car that was more than six years old and which had been driven 
for 37,000 miles to not have been of satisfactory quality at that time;
the car passed MOT tests in December 2016, January 2018 and November 2019, 
Miss M was able to drive nearly 15,000 miles in the car in the first year after it was 
supplied to her and she didnt complain to MotoNovo Finance about the faults with 
the car until June 2018  18 months after the car was supplied to her;
I sympathise with Miss M for the issues that shes had with the car but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to her;
Miss M still has the car but MotoNovo Finance has terminated the agreement and 
passed the outstanding balance on her account of £7,108.72 to its recoveries 
department in June 2019;
Miss M says that shes only been contacted once about her payments but shes 
made three complaints to MotoNovo Finance since June 2018 and Im not persuaded 
that its failure to contact her about the arrears on her account means that it cant 
recover those amounts from her; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
MotoNovo Finance to reinstate the agreement and repair the car, to reduce, or waive, the arrears on Miss Ms account, to pay her any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
I suggest that Miss M contacts MotoNovo Finance about the amount that she owes to it 
under the agreement and to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for that 
amount. If she doesnt do so I consider it to be likely that it will take further action against 
her, to the extent that its legally entitled to do so, to recover that money from her. If shes 
experiencing financial difficulties she should explain those difficulties to MotoNovo Finance. 
Its required to respond to any financial difficulties that shes experiencing positively and 
sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 May 2022.
