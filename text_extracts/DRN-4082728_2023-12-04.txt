The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed his account. Hed 
like an explanation for why his account was closed. 
What happened
Mr C had a foundation account with NatWest.
On 18 August 2021 NatWest blocked Mr Cs account. Mr Cs account was unblocked but on 
2 September 2021 NatWest sent Mr C a letter advising him the account would be closed on 
1 November 2021. 
Mr C complained to NatWest initially about the block then the lack of an explanation for why 
his account was closed. NatWest didnt uphold his complaint, they said theyd acted fairly in 
blocking and closing it. And didnt have to provide an explanation. 
Mr C didnt agree so brought his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into his complaint. After reviewing everything they advised 
Mr C that they thought NatWests actions in blocking and closing his account were fair. 
Mr C wasnt satisfied with their response  specifically hes unhappy that NatWest havent 
shared the reason his account was closed and the term they relied on.
As Mr C didnt agree its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and 
existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict customers accounts  
either in full or partially while they carry out their review. Having looked at whats happened I 
appreciate why Mr C may have found this inconvenient, but I cant say the block was unfair 
or was unduly long.
NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the terms and 
conditions of the account. Mr Cs account was a basic or foundation account, and theres 
strict legislation which NatWest have to follow on closing it fairly. Ive reviewed the evidence 
NatWest have shared with our service and the relevant terms and conditions. I realise this 
will disappoint Mr C but Im satisfied they acted fairly here. 
Mr Cs main unhappiness is to do with why NatWest closed his account  and which term 
they relied on in closing it. I appreciate this will disappoint Mr C, but NatWest are under no 
obligation to share their reasons for closing his account or the specific term relied on. 
NatWest have shared that information with our service and our rules allow us to receive 
certain evidence in confidence, if for example it includes security information or its 
commercially sensitive. I consider that some of the evidence NatWest have provided is 
information that should be kept confidential. I understand this will disappoint Mr C but Im 
satisfied that NatWest have arent required to share the reason for their actions with Mr C. 
For the reasons Ive outlined above I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further here. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2024.
