K821x#15complaint
Ms C complains that Harvey  & Thompson Limited was irresponsible when it provided her 
with a number  of loans between 2006  and 2014.
background
Harvey & Thompson says Ms C borrowed from it over a number of periods  in effect  taking 
68 loans. I've attached a table at the end of this decision, in the annex, which includes some 
of the information Harvey  & Thompson has provided about Ms Cs loans. Ms C says she 
took more than 68 loans: Ill address this later in my decision.
According to Harvey & Thompson the first 67 advances were cheque  loan products. 
This means  that when Ms C borrowed a sum of money from Harvey & Thompson,  she 
provided it with a cheque, backed by a cheque guarantee card, for a sum of money  which 
included the capital sum borrowed  and an amount  of interest. Harvey & Thompson  would  
then cash the cheque on an agreed date.  The lowest  sum borrowed was £174  but on one 
occasion it seems that Ms C borrowed £1,044.  Most of these loans were for £435 and £522 
which in effect  meant that Ms C was most  often required to repay  £500  or £600. 
The final loan was an instalment loan provided to Ms C in June 2013.  She borrowed  £400  
which was repayable over the following 12 months at around £53 per month.
In response to Ms Cs complaint Harvey  & Thompson made  an offer as a gesture of good 
will to settle it. Ms C didnt accept the offer and brought her complaint to our Service. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at Ms Cs complaint and recommended  that it should be 
upheld in respect of all the loans taken from and including Loan 7. Harvey  & Thompson 
didnt agree with that assessment. So, the complaint came to me - an ombudsman - for a 
decision. 
A few weeks  ago I issued  a provisional  decision in which  I explained why I was minded to 
uphold less of Ms Cs complaint than our adjudicator had recommended.  I proposed 
upholding her complaint  from the point she took Loan 10. I invited the parties to let me have 
anything else they wanted me to think about before  I reconsidered my decision.
This is my final decision. If Ms C accepts it, it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive once again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
This is what  I said in my provisional  decision:
This Service doesnt have jurisdiction to look at complaints about loans  taken before April 
2007 (Loans 1 to 6). I note that Ms C thinks she had some loans before October  2006  (which 
is when Harvey  & Thompson  says she began to borrow from it). I dont have jurisdiction to 
look at those  but, in any event, I dont think what she says takes us much  further especially as 
I am able to take into account the fact that she did take  even according to Harvey & 
Thompson  six loans between  October 2006 and April 2007.
Ref: DRN04210512At the time Harvey & Thompson provided  the loans to Ms C it was licensed by the Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT). There  is no doubt that businesses like Harvey & Thompson had to act 
responsibly and over the years the regulations and guidance have evolved. In the earlier part 
of this lending relationship,  broader  good  practice dictated  that responsible lenders should 
ensure that all loan applications went through sound and proper credit assessments and that 
the interests of the borrowers should be taken  into full account. In January 2008 the OFT 
issued the Consumer Credit Licensing   General Guidance for Licensees and Applicants on 
Fitness and Requirements  clarifying  some of the regulators expectations as regards 
responsible lending.
Ms Cs first 9 loans were provided over a 10-month period. The amounts of the loans tended 
to stay roughly the same  usually £522 although  Loan  9 was for the lower amount of £261.   
Its possible that Ms C may have had difficulties repaying them, but I havent been provided 
with anything to suggest that Ms C struggled to repay those loans. And I dont  think  I can 
safely say that Harvey  & Thompson acted  unfairly  in these circumstances in the environment 
at the time,  when it provided Loans 7 to 9. But Im not persuaded it acted responsibly when it 
provided Loan  10: this was for the highest amount yet so Ms C was due to repay £800.   
I think  that from that point Ms Cs pattern  of borrowing shouldve been enough  for Harvey  & 
Thompson to consider that further credit shouldnt  be advanced. Apart from December 2006 
she had been persistently  indebted to Harvey & Thompson for 11 months and the amount she 
was borrowing increased significantly  suggesting that she was most likely having  to borrow 
in order to repay earlier loans.  
The guidance went on to explain that the aim of the OFT was to ensure  that an appropriate 
standard of consumer protection was in place and that it would focus on a several things 
when assessing fitness of applicants for licenses. One of those considerations was integrity, 
adding that The way you operate any aspect of a business may well be relevant to your 
fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. It went  on to provide examples of the kind of 
evidence that may involve  integrity issues. The final example stated  evidence of business  
practices that appear to the OFT to be deceitful or oppressive or otherwise unfair  or improper 
whether unlawful or not and whether arising in relation to the licenses business  or otherwise 
with particular regard to any breaches of OFT guidance.  This could include evidence of 
irresponsible lending.
The guidance added that Lenders may take different approaches to responsible lending  in 
line with variations between the needs of different sectors of the market. However,  lenders 
should always  take reasonable  care in making loans  or advancing lines of credit and should  
take full account of the interests  of consumers  in doing so. They  should  undertake proper  and 
appropriate checks on the potential  borrower's  creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan 
and to meet the terms of the agreement. The checks should be proportionate, taking account  
of the type of agreement, the amounts involved, the nature of the lenders  relationship with 
the consumer,  and the degree of risk to the consumer . So, it seems that the avoidance of 
unfair practices that may result  in detriment to consumers  was central to the OFTs guidance.  
And this was emphasised  in the annex in the guidance. It listed  a number of practices that the 
OFT deemed  unlawful and/or considered unfair or improper. The final one of these was as 
follows:    
Irresponsible lending
Lending irresponsibly contrary to the provisions of section 25(2B) of
the Consumer Credit  Act 1974, by failing  to take reasonable care in
making loans or advancing lines of credit,  including making only
limited or no enquiries  about consumers'  income  before offering
loans, and failing to take full account of the interests of consumers
in doing so.
Ref: DRN04210513In summary, when granting licences, the OFT had regard to whether businesses were being 
run with integrity with particular concern around whether  licence holders were  engaging in 
unfair business practices of which  irresponsible lending was an example.   Businesses had to 
carry out proportionate checks, consider the risk to the borrower and take full account of the 
borrowers interests. 
So before granting credit  to Ms C, Harvey  & Thompson had to do proportionate checks. 
These had to take account  of the type of credit  (high-cost  short-term payday loans  for the 
most part),  the amounts involved (on average Ms Cs loans were for £455 from Loan 10), the 
nature of the lender's relationship with the consumer, and the degree of risk to the consumer.
Harvey & Thompson hasnt provided  details of the assessments it undertook  when Ms C 
began borrowing from it. It says that the lending  decision when [Ms C] originally applied were  
fully compliant with the regulatory requirements and industry expectations at the time and 
included criteria such as confirmation of employment,  receipt of regular  income above a 
minimum net monthly amount and a requirement  to hold a cheque  guarantee card.  It seems 
that Harvey & Thompson  put a lot of weight on whether  its borrowers had cheque  guarantee 
cards because if they did - Harvey & Thompson  says - it was a strong determinant of 
creditworthiness. But, because of the passage of time and its data retention  policies,  Harvey  
& Thompson isnt able to show us any other information it had about  Ms Cs financial 
circumstances at the time she was borrowing.
I accept that Ms C may have  been approved  for a cheque guarantee card.  But Im not 
persuaded that this means that Harvey & Thompson could rely on that fact to support the 
proposition that Ms C would be able to afford  her loans.  And as I dont know what other 
information it obtained about Ms C, I'm not able to say whether it did do proportionate checks.  
But Im also unable,  at this late stage, to say what those checks wouldve  shown. However,  
with the over-arching obligation to act responsibly  in mind, I can say that Im not currently 
persuaded that Harvey & Thompson acted responsibly  towards Ms C, from the point she took 
Loan 10 and thereafter. 
I say this because of the overall pattern  of Ms Cs borrowing. She had been borrowing  from 
Harvey & Thompson for 11 months. The only months during which  she hadnt borrowed had 
been in December 2006. And the amount shed  been borrowing had increased. In my view 
this pattern was highly  suggestive of someone who was reliant on these  loans in order to 
make ends meet. 
I think  that at this point Harvey & Thompson shouldve realised,  that Ms C was in a cycle of 
borrowing which meant that shed have to borrow  again to bridge the gap left in her finances 
by repaying her earlier loans. I think this pattern  of borrowing was harmful for Ms C. And I'm 
not persuaded  that Harvey & Thompson was taking full account of her interests when it 
continued to lend to her in this way.
And I think that Ms C lost out because Harvey  & Thompson continued  to provide her with 
credit from loan 10 onwards. These loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging  her 
indebtedness by allowing her to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use. The sheer  
number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Ms Cs ability to access 
mainstream (and cheaper)  credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost  loans.
I dont agree with Harvey  & Thompson when it says that Ms Cs periods of borrowing were 
short with clear  gaps between the periods  she borrowed  from us. This is evidence  of the 
payday loan being used exactly as intended,  to meet a short-term financial need. I accept  
that there was a gap between  Loans 31 and 32. It seems that Ms C may not have borrowed 
from Harvey & Thompson between October 2009 and May 2010. But by that point she had 
been borrowing consistently from Harvey & Thompson since at least October 2006. 
Ref: DRN04210514There had only been five months in that three-year period during which Ms C wasnt indebted 
to Harvey & Thompson. I'm not persuaded that it could be assured that a gap of that relatively 
short period was enough to conclude that Ms C wasnt still reliant  on these high-cost short-
term loans  especially as Loan 32 was again for the higher amount of £522 compared to 
Loans 29 to 31 which had been for the lower  amount  of £174. From  that point Ms C went on 
to borrow every month - apart  from Feb 2011 - until June 2013 when she changed her pattern 
of borrowing and took an instalment loan.
And, apart from the break between Loans 31 and 32, the only other gaps were  for single 
month periods. This means that between  October 2006  and May 2014  a period of 92 
months - there were only around  12 months when  Ms C wasnt  indebted to Harvey & 
Thompson. In these  circumstances it seems to me that the loans werent being  used as 
intended to meet a short term need as suggested by Harvey & Thompson. The whole pattern 
suggested a long-term unsustainable reliance on these loans.
I also note Harvey & Thompsons comments about Ms Cs repayment history supporting its 
decision to continue lending. But as Harvey & Thompson will be aware  the fact that someone 
repays a loan doesnt necessarily  mean that they do so from sustainable  means.
With all of this in mind,  Im intending to uphold Ms Cs complaint about Loans  10 to 68 and 
Harvey & Thompson should  put things right as set out below.
Since issuing my provisional  decision Ms C has again drawn my attention  to some cheque-
books stubs shed previously provided.   She  says that these show  that she was borrowing 
from Harvey & Thompson before October  2006. Ive had another look at the stubs Ms C has 
provided. I note that some  are dated  from the period in which  Im satisfied she did have 
loans from Harvey & Thompson.  But there  are others which  are dated earlier  in particular 
June and July 2006. Two different payees have been entered  on to these stubs  some  are 
stamped by the lender  and others  have  been written by hand by - I assume - Ms C. And I 
note that some of the later ones,  from October, dont have a payee  entered  on to the stub at 
all. 
Harvey & Thompson has provided its statement of account for Ms C. The record of loans  it 
says it provided to Ms C suggests that the earliest transactions took place in October  2006.  I 
accept its possible that there were  some earlier loans. But based on what  Ive seen, on the 
balance of probabilities, I cant safely conclude that if there  were  earlier  loans, how many 
there were, how much  they were for and, perhaps most importantly, whether they were 
provided by Harvey & Thompson.  So my decision  continues to be about the loans appearing 
in the table in the annex  below.  
Ive also thought again about whether Loan  10 is the right point from which  to uphold Ms Cs 
complaint. I accept that the guidance I referred to in my provisional  decision was issued in 
January 2008  and that Loan 10 was issued in August  2007  and I didnt  expressly 
acknowledge that in my provisional decision.  But I had thought  about  it. And in any event, 
throughout its lending relationship with Ms C - even in 2006,  before the time this Service  had 
jurisdiction - Harvey & Thompson was required to lend responsibly. It also had to take the 
interests of Ms C into full account. 
For the same reasons  as I previously explained, I dont think Harvey & Thompson was 
responsible or took account of Ms Cs interests  when  it continued  to lend further  to Ms C at 
the point it approved Loan 10. This is because  amongst other things - 
 
Ms C had been borrowing from Harvey & Thompson for at least 11 months with only 
one month when she wasnt indebted,  
Ref: DRN04210515the amount  she was borrowing increased  and she wasnt  making any in-roads into 
reducing her debt 
the pattern  of borrowing  was highly suggestive of someone who was reliant on these  
expensive loans  
So, in summary,  and with everything in mind, I think Harvey & Thompson  acted  irresponsibly  
when it continued  to provide loans to Ms C from the point she was approved  for Loan  10. 
From that point Harvey  & Thompson was causing her harm  by continuing to lend, as the 
effect was to unfairly prolong her indebtedness by allowing  her to take expensive credit  
intended for short-term  use. And the number of loans was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Ms Cs ability  to access mainstream  (and cheaper) credit  and so kept her in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans. 
I want to reassure the parties that I have thought carefully about everything  again but in the 
circumstances Ive outlined, I see no reason  to alter my provisional  conclusions. I uphold 
Ms Cs complaint about Loans 10 to 68 and require Harvey & Thompson to put things right.     
putting things right
Harvey & Thompson shouldnt have provided  Loans 10 to 68 to Ms C  in other words it 
shouldnt have provided her with any of the loans taken  from (and including)  February  2008  
and it should put things  right as set out below:
1)Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms C towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  
2)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Ms C which were 
considered as part of 1), calculated from the date she originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
3)Pay Ms C the total of 1) plus 2)
4)The overall pattern  of Ms Cs borrowing for these loans means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so if they still appear  on her credit  file Harvey & 
Thompson should remove them entirely.  
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Harvey & Thompson to deduct tax from this interest. It should  give Ms C 
a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above and in my provisional decision I uphold Ms Cs complaint in 
part and require  Harvey  & Thompson Limited to put things right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2020.
