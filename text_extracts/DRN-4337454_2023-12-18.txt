The complaint
Mr C complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC charged incorrect interest on his loan.
What happened
In December 2019 Mr C took out a loan of £4,800 over 5 years. The annual interest rate of 
the loan was 22.278% and the monthly repayments were £134.20.
Mr C raised a complaint with Barclays in March 2023. He said he was being charged the 
wrong amount of interest on the loan.
Barclays didnt uphold the complaint. It said it had calculated interest correctly.
Mr C remained unhappy and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said he couldnt see anything to suggest 
that the way interest had been calculated was incorrect.
Mr C didnt agree. He said he hadnt missed any payments and that the actual rate of 
interest he was being charged was 24.7%. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed the loan agreement. This shows that the loan amount was £4,800 with a total 
amount to be repaid (including interest) of £8052.
Mr C has said that the total amount to be repaid should be £5,611.50 and that hes paid 
£5233.80 so far (this being 39 instalments of £134.20).
Looking at the loan agreement I agree with Mr C that the monthly instalment is £134.20. 
However, Im unable to see where Mr C has obtained a total amount to be repaid of 
£5,611.50. Based on what Ive seen, the monthly payment multiplied by the term of the loan 
results in a total amount to be repaid figure of £8052 (60 x £134.20).
Mr C has raised some points about the amount of capital being repaid each month. I can see 
that Mr C took out the loan on 4 December 2019. His first loan payment was due on 15 
January 2020. Barclays has explained that interest is calculated daily, so there is 
proportionately more interest payable in the first month than there would be normally. So, in 
the first month of the loan, £11.27 of capital was repaid. In the second month, £43.84 of 
capital was repaid. Each month after that, the capital balance reduces, and the interest 
amount reduces accordingly.
Ive reviewed the indicative repayment schedule which Barclays sent to Mr C in October 
2020. This shows the expected capital and interest due going forwards.
Based on the information available, I havent seen any evidence to suggest that the way in 
which Barclays has applied interest to the loan is incorrect. 
Im unable to comment on Mr Cs assertion that the actual interest rate is 24.7% because 
this service isnt an accountant. The loan agreement sets out the applicable interest rate. 
Barclays has said that the loan has fallen into arrears. I understand that Mr C disputes this. 
However, if it is the case that there have been missed or late payments, this will have 
impacted on the level of interest during the period of the loan.
Taking everything into account, Im unable to find evidence that interest has been applied 
incorrectly to the loan. Im therefore unable to uphold the complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
