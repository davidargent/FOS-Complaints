The complaint
Mrs B is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, reimbursed a buyer who had 
incorrectly claimed that an item that shed sold was significantly not as described. 
What happened
Mrs B sold a designer bag online and received a payment of £313.80 from the buyer via 
PayPal. However, approximately, three weeks later the buyer raised a dispute with PayPal 
on the basis that the bag was significantly not as described. PayPal found in the buyers 
favour and reimbursed the buyer, placing Mrs Bs PayPal account £313.80 in debt. Mrs B 
initially refused to pay this amount but did so begrudgingly when PayPal passed her account 
to a debt collection company to avoid adverse information being recorded on her credit file.
Mrs B wasnt happy about what had happened, especially as shed sold the bag with articles 
of authentication, and she was also unhappy that when the bag was received back from the 
buyer it had clearly been used and wasnt in the same condition as it had been sold. So, she 
raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mrs Bs complaint, but they felt that they had correctly followed their buyer 
protection dispute process, and so they didnt uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Mrs B wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They didnt feel that PayPals application of 
its buyer protection scheme had resulted in a fair outcome in this instance. Specifically, they 
didnt feel that PayPal had done enough to check whether the bag was significantly not as 
described, and they felt that if PayPal had done this, they would most likely have resolved 
the dispute in Mrs Bs favour. Because of this, our investigator recommended that this 
complaint be upheld in Mrs Bs favour.
PayPal didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal contend that they processed the dispute raised by the buyer in line with their terms 
and conditions, to which Mrs B had agreed when she opened a PayPal account.
I can appreciate PayPals position here, to a degree. But it is within the remit of this service 
to instruct against a business where an application of terms and conditions by that business 
has led to an unfair outcome. And I feel that this is whats happened here.
In this case, the buyer raised a dispute with PayPal on the basis that the bag was 
significantly not as described. It therefore becomes incumbent on PayPal, if they are going to 
uphold that dispute, to confirm that the bag that was received by the buyer was significantly 
not as described by Mrs B in the sales advertisement.
Ultimately, I dont think that PayPal did that here. Its evident from the sales description and 
photograph that the bag looked as described, and this fact hasnt been disputed by the 
buyer. What the buyer did dispute was the authenticity of the bag. But Mrs B sold the bag 
with articles of authentication, including an authenticity card and paperwork. And while it was 
the case that the authenticity sticker had been removed from the bag by Mrs B before the 
sale, it was made clear in the sales advert that this was the case.
Furthermore, Mrs B confirmed that the authenticity of the item could be confirmed by 
contacting the manufacturer directly, and its notable that the sales advert confirmed the store 
location and date where the item was purchased. But it seems that this wasnt done by 
PayPal, and its difficult to understand why PayPal accepted the version of events proposed 
by the buyer over the reasoning of Mrs B, given that PayPal appear to have done nothing to 
verify that the item wasnt as described before upholding the dispute against Mrs B.
Additionally, it would also be expected by this service that, if PayPal are going to uphold a 
claim such as this, that they would ensure that the item that is returned to the seller is in the 
same condition as when it was sold. Mrs B has stated that this wasnt the case in this 
instance, and that when the bag was received back from the buyer that it has clearly been 
used and was no longer in the used but in excellent condition state that it had been sold in.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that PayPal were wanting here, but it follows that Im 
satisfied that by upholding the buyers dispute in the manner that they did, PayPals actions 
have led to an unfair outcome for Mrs B here. And it follows that Ill be upholding this 
complaint in Mrs Bs favour accordingly. 
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment of £313.80 to Mrs B, along with 8% interest calculated from 
the date that Mrs B made the payment to the debt collection company to the date that 
PayPal make the payment back to Mrs B.
PayPal must also make a further payment to Mrs B to compensate her for the trouble and 
upset this matter has caused.
These payments may not take the form of a credit to Mrs Bs PayPal account unless Mrs B 
give her permission for them to do so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
