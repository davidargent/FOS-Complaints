Miss M has instructed a third party company to bring  this complaint on her behalf but I will 
refer to Miss M throughout  the complaint. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ms complaint in part and thought  that the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been  provided to her.
Quick Quid disagreed with our adjudicators  view.  As the parties havent been able to resolve  
the compliant  informally, the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss M could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into 
Ref: DRN39401332account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Quick 
Quid should fairly and reasonably have done  more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid  was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that 
this is the case.  This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
loans one to four
Before lending to Miss M, Quick Quid asked her for details of her income, and her normal  
monthly expenditure. It then used this information, together with data it gathered  from other 
sources such as her credit  file, to calculate what  it termed her estimated  disposable income 
(EDI). This was the amount that Quick Quid thought Miss M could afford  to spend each 
month repaying her borrowing.
Ref: DRN39401333Based upon what  Miss M had said about her expenditure,  and the EDI that Quick Quid  had 
calculated, I think the repayments she needed to make on the first four loans would have 
appeared affordable. Given what was apparent about Miss Ms circumstances at the time,  
and her history with the lender,  I dont think it wouldve been proportionate  for Quick Quid  to 
have asked her for any more information  than it did. And there  wasnt anything in the 
information Miss M provided, or in the information  of which Quick Quid shouldve  been 
aware, that ought  to have prompted it to verify what  she was saying.
So I dont  think Quick  Quid was wrong to give the first four loans to Miss M. 
loans five to fourteen
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Quick Quids  lending  history with Miss M, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Quick  Quid should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, so that it ought to have  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan five. I say this because:
this was Miss Ms fifth loan from Quick Quid in around ten months;
there had been indicators that Quick Quid shouldve seen during the course  of the earlier 
loans that suggested  Miss M was having  problems  in managing her finances. For 
example, shed asked  for loans two and four to be extended  shortly  before the original  
repayment dates.  This implies that Miss M had been struggling to repay  them;
her fifth loan from Quick Quid was requested just a number of days  after loan four had 
been repaid. I think that Quick Quid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not 
that Miss M was having to borrow further  to cover holes  in her finances left by the 
repayment of her previous loans;
I think that the pattern of lending shouldve  alerted Quick  Quid  to the likelihood  that 
Miss M was having problems managing  her money. So I think  that it should have been 
concerned that she wouldnt be able to repay  the loans sustainably.
I note the comments made  by Quick Quid about  the gaps between the loans. Aside from a 
gap of around two months between loans nine and ten, there were typically breaks in lending 
of around a couple of weeks at most. I dont think that it would have been reasonable for 
Quick Quid to conclude  from this that such  gaps  represented an indication  that Miss Ms loan 
repayments were sustainable.
Ultimately, save  for these modest  breaks  in the loans, Miss M was indebted to Quick  Quid 
for a period  in excess of two years - and she wasnt really making  any substantive inroads to 
the amount she owed  it. She had paid significant amounts of interest to service  what  was, in 
effect, an almost constant debt to Quick Quid over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out as a result of Quick Quid  having provided these loans because:
they had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time;
Ref: DRN39401334the extended period of time over which Miss M owed  Quick Quid  money was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im partially upholding this complaint and Quick  Quid should  put things right.
putting things right
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans five to fourteen;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
the period  of time Miss M owed Quick Quid money  means that any information  still 
recorded on her credit  file in relation  to loans five to fourteen is adverse. So all such 
entries should be removed from Miss Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick  Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid 
must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above my final decision is that I partially uphold this complaint and I 
instruct CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) to put things right as detailed  above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 August 2019.
