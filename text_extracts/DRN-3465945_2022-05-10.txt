The complaint
Mr M complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) have failed to refund money he lost 
as part of a scam. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything in 
detail again here. In summary, Mr M lost over £70,000 to an investment scam between 
January and May 2018. Some of the payments were made from his Barclays debit card to 
Neteller (an e-money transfer service) where the funds were then sent to VIP Coins (a 
cryptocurrency trading platform) and then subsequently taken by the scammers who had 
helped Mr M set up the VIP Coin account. He also made payments to other 
merchants/banks that he says were part of the scam, as shown in the table below:

Mr M disputed the transactions with Barclays, who refused to provide him with a refund 
given he had authorised the transactions. Our investigator also didnt uphold Mr Ms 
complaint. He didnt consider the loss caused by the payments to Neteller to have been a 
foreseeable consequence of Barclays failure to intervene in them being made. And with 
regards to the other payments, the investigator didnt think these would have appeared 
unusual when compared with Mr Ms normal account and spending activity. Mr M disagreed, 
so the matter has been escalated to me to determine. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
Mr M says the scammer told him to send money to the VIP Coin platform via Neteller, 
which is a legitimate regulated e-money transfer service. So, the first lot of 
transactions were paid from Mr Ms debit card to his Neteller account first, before it 
was subsequently put into the hands of the scammer from the VIP Coin platform. 
So, in this instance, there is no way Barclays could have reasonably foreseen that 
the money Mr M was sending to a legitimate e-money transfer service would 
subsequently be transferred on again to a crypto wallet, and then again to a 
scammer. As a result, Im satisfied that Barclays cannot be said to have caused 
Mr Ms loss by failing to prevent the payments, as the loss would not have been 
reasonably foreseeable  thereby breaking the chain of causation. 
Even if the loss could be said to have been foreseeable, the fact that the loss didnt 
occur from Mr Ms Barclays account but from another unconnected e-money account 
would, in my opinion, constitute an intervening act that would also break the chain of 
causation here. So, Im satisfied there is no legal or fair and reasonable basis in 
which to hold Barclays liable for the loss Mr M incurred through the payments he 
made to Neteller.   
Mr M would have also been out of time to raise a chargeback claim about the 
Neteller payments, as he disputed them after the 120-day time limit set by the 
chargeback scheme provider. But even if he were in time to raise a claim, it would 
have likely failed in any event given that Mr M paid a legitimate company (Neteller) 
from his Barclays account and received the goods/services as they were intended. 
In terms of the other payments Mr M made to World Clearing and Blago Capital, Ive 
considered whether Barclays should have done more to prevent Mr M from falling 
victim to the scam. as there are some situations in which a bank should reasonably 
have had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular transfer. For 
example, if it was particularly out of character. 
The payments Mr M made ranged from around £1,000 up to as high as £40,500. 
However, while a payment for over £40,000 would usually be considered a large 
transaction, it was not unusual when compared with Mr Ms spending history. I can 
see from his statements, for example, that he had made a transaction for £32,000 
just four months prior to making the £40,500 payment he is now disputing. And while 
I appreciate this payment was for a higher amount, it was not significantly higher than 
payments he had made in the past and therefore did not represent a significant 
deviation from his normal level of spending.
As a result, Im not persuaded the other payments Mr M made from his Barclays 
account ought to have been regarded as suspicious or indicating that he might have 
been at risk of falling for a scam. So, I dont think Barclays can fairly be held liable for Mr Ms loss here either, as Im not persuaded there was any obligation on them to 
intervene or prevent the payments in these circumstances. 
I appreciate this will likely come as a disappointment to Mr M, and Im sorry to hear he has 
been the victim of a cruel scam. However, in the circumstances, I do not consider it would be 
fair and reasonable to hold Barclays liable for his loss.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 June 2022.
