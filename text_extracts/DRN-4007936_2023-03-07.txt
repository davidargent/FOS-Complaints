The complaint
Miss M is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made the decision to
close her accounts because she resides overseas.
What happened
Miss M is a UK resident who works overseas for a UK company and who returns to the UK
on a regular basis to maintain her UK resident status.
Miss M spoke with NatWest because she needed to reeded to receive new debit cards. The
staff member she spoke with suggested that, rather than having the new cards sent to her
UK address to be forwarded to her, it would be easier for Miss M to update her address with
NatWest to her overseas address so that the new debit cards could be sent to her directly.
Miss M updated her address with NatWest as suggested, but shortly afterwards she
received notice from NatWest that they would be closing her account in 180 days because
she lived overseas. Miss M wasnt happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Miss Ms complaint. They noted that the terms of their account allowed
them to close an account with the provision of notice as they were doing, and they explained
that theyd taken the commercial decision to no longer offer banking services to many
customers who are based outside the UK. Miss M wasnt satisfied with NatWests response,
so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest had acted
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so they didnt uphold the complaint. Miss
M remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 8 February 2023 as follows:
In much the same way as a person can choose whether they will apply to or continue 
to hold an account with a particular bank, so a bank is entitled to choose whether it 
will offer, or continue to offer, its services to any particular customer.
This point is covered in NatWests terms and conditions, which confirm that NatWest 
are entitled to close an account after providing notice of their intention to do so to 
their customer. This is as per section 12.2 of NatWests terms and conditions, as 
follows:
We can also close any other account by giving you at least 60 days notice.
We will explain our reasons for closing your account unless theres a legal or 
security reason which means we cant provide any explanation.
But it doesnt necessarily follow that because the closure of Miss Ms account is 
permitted by the terms and conditions of that account, that NatWest have applied 
those terms, and taken the decision to close Miss Ms account, fairly or reasonably in 
this instance.
Indeed, given that NatWest only provided notice to Miss M that they would be closing 
her account following her updating her address with them from her UK address to her 
overseas address, and given that Miss M remains a UK resident  albeit one that 
works overseas  I dont feel that NatWest have made a fair decision to close Miss 
Ms account.
My provisional instructions here will therefore include that NatWest must revert the 
address they hold for Miss M back to the UK address they held for her previously  
which I note that Miss M has been asking NatWest to do since she first contacted 
them about this issue.
This would invalidate NatWests present reasoning for wanting to close Miss Ms 
account. And while I accept that NatWest would retain the right to close Miss Ms 
account moving forwards, Im satisfied that they would need to provide an updated 
fair explanation to Miss M of their reason to want to her account with them, as per 
NatWests terms as quoted above.
Additionally, given that I feel that this issue could and should have been quickly 
resolved by reverting Miss Ms address back to the previous UK address when she 
first approached NatWest about this, my provisional instructions also include that 
NatWest must make a payment of £250 to Miss M as compensation for the trouble 
and upset that Im satisfied Miss M has unnecessarily incurred because of NatWests 
actions and inactions here.
Both Miss M and NatWest have confirmed that theyre happy to accept the outcome 
described in my provisional decision. As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision 
upholding this complaint on the basis described above, and I therefore confirm that I do 
uphold this complaint on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
NatWest must revert the address they hold for Miss M back to the UK address they held for 
her previously.
This will invalidate NatWests present reasoning for wanting to close Miss Ms account. If 
NatWest continue to want to close Miss Ms account, they must provide new notice to Miss 
M of their intention to do so, in line with their terms.
NatWest must make a payment of £250 to Miss M as compensation for the trouble and 
upset shes incurred here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 April 2023.
