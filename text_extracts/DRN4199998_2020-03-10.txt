Mrs F complains that Provident  Personal  Credit Limited lent to her irresponsibly.
background 
Provident has explained that as these loans were taken several  years  ago then it does not 
have many records. So, I have used what it sent us to make a Loan Table.

5 07/08/2008 105 not closed £1,500 £1,571 £127
Loans 4 and 5 were  transferred to a third-party  debt collector on 2 January 2014  with a 
balance of £2,707 (rounded up).
Mrs F complained to Provident  about all of the loans in May 2018. In June 2018 Provident  
wrote to Mrs F to say that it was not going to look at any of the loans as they were approved 
more than six years before Mrs F had complained. Provident altered its view and gave 
consent for us to look at the loans  taken more than six years before that complaint date.
Mrs F has said that she has had loans with Provident since 1985. Mrs F says that these 
were continuous  until 2011. Provident replied to say that it did not have records going back  
to 1985. 
This service did not have  jurisdiction to consider consumer credit matters  until 6 April 2007. 
So, we are not able to consider Loans  1 and 2 as they are outside our jurisdiction. Our 
adjudicator explained this when he sent his opinion  and he also explained  that the first loan 
he could review was Loan 3. The adjudicator who considered the complaint thought  that 
Provident should put things right for Mrs F in relation to Loan 5. 
Provident agreed with this but Provident has explained  that Mrs F has not paid a great deal 
of the principal sum (£1,500) and so there  is no monetary redress  due to Mrs F. Provident 
has said that it will correct Mrs Fs credit  file in respect of Loan  5.
Mrs F has not accepted  Providents offer. She says that it pushed her to have the loans and 
she was approved for more than the ones shown in the table.  She referred to a time she was 
ill in 2011. 
I asked Provident  about additional records it may have about loans from 2008 to 2011 as 
Mrs F has suggested  she had more. Providents reply was that the table above shows  all the 
loans it has been  able to find. The most  recent loan was approved on 7 August 2008.
The complaint was unresolved and was passed to me for a decision.  
Ref: DRN41999982my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
Once the complaint was passed to me, I asked Provident for more information  to check  
whether there were other loans. It has sent me all that it has, and the Loan  Table  set out 
above is based on that information from Provident.
 
I have asked Mrs F to send to me anything she has to assist: copy bank statements, 
information about her financial position, payment books from Provident and any other  details 
of other  loans she said she had. I have not received anything from her.
While I appreciate that Mrs F does not agree with Providents offer on Loan  5, in the 
absence of any additional information  from her then I endorse the offer made in line with the 
adjudicators view.
Provident needs to put things right for Mrs F in relation to Loan  5 by doing  the following:
A)Provident should add together the total of the repayments made  by Mrs F towards interest, 
fees and charges on Loan 5 including payments made to a third party where  applicable, 
but not including anything  Provident  has already refunded.
B)Provident should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs F 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date she originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Provident may  if it chooses  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which it 
has written-off  other than Loan  5.
D)Provident should pay any remaining refund to Mrs F. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made  up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for Provident  to 
pursue this further.
E)The overall pattern  of Mrs Fs borrowing for Loan  5 means any information recorded  about 
it is adverse, so Provident should remove it entirely from her credit file. If Provident has 
sold the loan it should ask the debt purchaser  to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident to deduct tax from this interest. It should give
Ref: DRN41999983Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax was deducted, if this is applicable and if Mrs F 
asks for one.
my final decision
I endorse the offer made by Provident Personal Credit Limited and it needs to put things 
right as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 April 2020.
