The complaint
Mr B complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. His 
wife is also involved with his complaint and hes being represented in his complaint by a 
claims management company.
What happened
Mr B and his wife bought a timeshare in May 2009 and Mr B entered into a loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare. He says that the timeshare cost 
Â£6,242. Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan was settled in October 2010. Mr B says 
that he and his wife upgraded to a new timeshare with a different timeshare company in May 
2013 which he says he also paid for using a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance. 
He has described further upgrades that took place in 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019 (some paid 
for using loans from Barclays Partner Finance and some paid for using cash) and says that 
the timeshare company that theyve been with since May 2013 has stopped trading. He says 
that he became aware that he could complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the 
timeshares in November or December 2019 and that he took advice about it in January 
2020.
Mr Bs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act in May 2020. Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a 
substantive response to those claims by August 2020 so a complaint was made to this 
service. 
Mr Bs representative says, amongst other things, that:
the timeshare was sold to Mr B under significant pressure and using commercially 
aggressive sales practices;
the timeshare was misrepresented to him; 
the timeshare company cant provide the services and is in breach of contract;
there was an unfair relationship between Barclays Partner Finance and Mr B;
Barclays Partner Finance paid commission to the timeshare company which wasnt 
disclosed to Mr B; and
a proper affordability check wasnt undertaken.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Mr Bs claims were more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so he thought 
that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to look into his claims under sections 75 and 
140A was fair. He said that he hadnt seen anything that would suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mr B. He also said that Mr B had upgraded his timeshare with a different 
company in 2013 which appeared to supersede the 2009 agreement so he was unable to 
consider any breach of contract claim against the different timeshare company in this 
complaint.
Mr Bs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
theres no statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act 
or for asking this service to look into a refusal by a creditor to properly investigate a 
complaint and the time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
the timeshare company went into liquidation in May 2020 so is unable to provide the 
product sold and the date of knowledge of that for making a claim under section 75 
runs from the date the company went into liquidation;
the timeshare company marketed and sold the timeshare as an investment in breach 
of the Timeshare Regulations  it was illegal for it to do so which was deliberately 
concealed from Mr B and section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the period of 
limitation until the concealment was discovered;
Mr B only discovered the actual characteristics of the product many years after he 
purchased it  its a long term contract with unlimited liability for management 
charges which was concealed at the point of purchase and is unduly onerous;
Mr B only became aware that he had cause for complaint in January 2020 when he 
sought advice and that is the date of knowledge for the purposes of the six year 
limitation period;
the existence and the amount of commission paid by Barclays Partner Finance were 
concealed from Mr B at the point of sale and the limitation period under section 140A 
is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation Act until he could be aware of those 
facts with reasonable diligence and that he only became aware of the non-disclosure 
when he sought professional advice in January 2020; and
the loan has all the hallmarks of an unaffordable loan given the interest rate and that 
no affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to Mr B - theres an 
unfair creditor-debtor relationship under section 140A and Mr B has exercised more 
than reasonable diligence in complaining about the affordability assessment.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
I havent been provided with a copy of Mr Bs contract with the timeshare company or 
his loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance  Mr B says that he entered into 
the loan agreement in September 2009 but Barclays Partner Finance says that the 
loan was made to Mr B in May 2009 and Ive seen a letter from Barclays Partner 
Finance that was sent after the loan was made and is dated in June 2009 so I 
consider it to be more likely than not that the loan was made to Mr B in May 2009;
nor have I been provided with any of the other contracts relating to Mr Bs upgrades 
of his timeshare in May 2013, 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019 or any loan agreement 
that he used to pay for those upgrades but I consider it to be clear from Mr Bs 
complaint form and the correspondence from his representative that his complaint 
relates to the timeshare that he bought in May 2009 and the loan that was made to 
him by Barclays Partner Finance at that time;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Bs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his claims under the 
Limitation Act and his representative says that theres no statutory time limit on 
raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act and the time limit of six years 
applies to the raising of a court action;
I accept that Mr B has referred his complaint to this service within six years of the 
event that hes complained about  which is the turning down of his claims under the 
Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance has 
acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
Mr Bs claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Bs claims under section 75 are that the timeshare was misrepresented to him 
and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him, and that 
theres been a breach of contract;
in making a claim under the Consumer Credit Act, Mr B is seeking a legal remedy, so 
if Barclays Partner Finance turned down his initial claim, he would be able to ask a 
court to consider it or ask our service to assess if Barclays Partner Finance had 
acted fairly  but that means that Barclays Partner Finance is able to consider any 
legal defence it may have to his claims, whether or not Mr B subsequently decided to 
take his claim to court - so although the Consumer Credit Act doesnt contain any 
explicit time limits within the body of the legislation, Im satisfied that the Limitation 
Act does apply in the way it does to all legal claims;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr B could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that induced him into buying the 
timeshare when he entered into the contract to buy the timeshare in May 2009 as 
that was when he entered into an agreement based on what he says were the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as he entered into 
the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
May 2020, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;Mr Bs representative says that Mr B only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Barclays Partner Finance after he sought advice from it in January 2020  but 
when he had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Bs 
claims;
Mr B and his representative say that the timeshare company went into liquidation in 
May 2020 so is unable to provide the services to him which is a breach of contract for 
which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable under section 75  but the timeshare 
company with which he entered into a contract in May 2009 appears to be a different 
company to the company with which he upgraded his timeshare in May 2013 and 
subsequently and which has now stopped trading;
as Mr B used the loan from Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the original 
timeshare in May 2009, Im unable to consider a breach of contract by another 
timeshare company under a later timeshare agreement as part of this complaint  
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
breach of the contract that Mr B entered into in May 2009 and for which Barclays 
Partner Finance would be liable under section 75;
Mr Bs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr B and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr B entered into the loan agreement in May 
2009 and settled it in October 2010 - so Mr B would have needed to make a claim 
against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of October 2010  but he didnt 
make a claim to it until May 2020, more than nine years later, which was outside of 
the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Bs representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mr B and that he didnt discover the 
concealment until after hed sought advice from it in January 2020;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mr B and his representative have set out what they say happened before Mr B 
entered into the contract with the timeshare company and loan agreement in May 
2009  but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information, in fact many of the things that 
they say werent right would have been known to Mr B at the time of the sale, so I 
dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Mr Bs representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told him 
about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, 
was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mr B risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
his representative also says that the timeshare company marketed and sold the 
timeshare as an investment  but I consider that any claim about that would now be 
time-barred under the Limitation Act for the reasons set out above;
Mr Bs representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr B and that no 
affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to him;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr B and he 
didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or ask 
it for any information about the affordability assessment until May 2020  as the loan 
was made in May 2009 and ended in October 2010, I consider it to be more likely 
than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loan would now be time 
barred; 
nor have I seen evidence to show that Mr B was unduly pressured into entering into 
the timeshare contract or the loan agreement in May 2009 or that the timeshare 
company used unacceptable commercial practices against Mr B  he didnt complain 
to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until May 2020  more than nine 
years after he entered into the agreements and I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues 
before then;
hes also described the five upgrades that he bought between 2013 and 2019 and, if 
he considered that he was unduly pressured into entering into the timeshare contract 
or loan agreement in May 2009 or that the timeshare company had used 
unacceptable commercial practices, I consider it to be unlikely that hed have bought 
those upgrades; 
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Mr Bs claim by 
August 2020 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it should have 
assessed his claim under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so I cant say that 
it acted fairly and reasonably in response to his claims  but I consider that it wouldnt 
have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would have said that 
the claims werent made within the periods set out in the Limitation Act; and 
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that hes had with his timeshare and the 
difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the 
money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
