The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that contracts that they entered into with a supplier for some 
replacement windows and roof trims, which they paid for using fixed sum loan agreements 
with Shawbrook Bank Limited, and the loan agreements, were misrepresented to them and 
that the loans werent affordable for them. Mr and Mrs H are being helped with their 
complaint by a representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs H entered into a contract with a supplier for some replacement windows 
that they signed in June 2016  the initial cost of the windows was £7,942.80 from 
which a finance discount of £1,642.80 was deducted so the cost of the windows was 
reduced to £6,300 and they made an advance payment of £1,000;
they also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank, that they 
electronically signed in June 2016, to pay for the windows  the amount of the loan 
was £5,300 and they agreed to repay it by 96 monthly repayments of £116.06;
the replacement windows were fitted in August 2016 and later that month they 
entered into another contract with the supplier for some roof trims  the initial cost of 
the roof trims was £3,860.30 from which a finance discount of £460.30 was deducted 
so the cost of the roof trims was reduced to £3,400 and they made an advance 
payment of £99;
they also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank, that they 
electronically signed in August 2016, to pay for the roof trims  the amount of the 
loan was £3,301 and they agreed to repay it by 96 monthly repayments of £72.29  
and the roof trims were fitted in November 2016;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative complained to Shawbrook in October 2018 that the 
agreements had been misrepresented to them but it discussed the complaint with the 
supplier, described the process that had been followed, and didnt agree that the 
agreements had been misrepresented;
a complaint was made to this service but our investigator didnt think that there had 
been a breach of contract or a misrepresentation and he thought that Shawbrook 
Bank had acted fairly in how it responded to Mr and Mrs Hs complaint;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has asked for their complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman so Ive carefully considered their representatives complaint letter which 
says, in summary  and amongst other things  that: the prices of the replacement 
windows and roof trims were inflated before discounts were applied to falsely give the 
impression of a discount; the finance discount coerced them into entering into the 
agreement which was a breach of contract; incorrect figures were used in the 
agreements; the suppliers terms are unfair, there have been breaches of the 
Financial Conduct Authoritys Consumer Credit sourcebook; and the fixed sum loan 
agreements were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Hs claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr and Mrs H signed the contracts with the supplier for the replacement windows and 
the roof trims to confirm that: they understood the suppliers gold account program 
and how it worked; the pre-contract credit information had been explained to them 
and theyd been given a copy; their income was accurate and they werent expecting 
any changes to their financial circumstances; theyd been given a copy of the Money 
Matters booklet; and that the cancellation rights had been explained to them;
I consider that the prices of the windows and trims were clearly set out in the 
contracts and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence show that the supplier 
acted unfairly or unreasonably in selling the windows and trims to them or in 
connection with the loan agreements;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H tried to cancel any of the 
agreements and they entered into the agreements for the roof trims after the 
replacement windows had been fitted  I consider that they would only have done so 
if they were happy with the way that that had been handled;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the suppliers terms are 
unfair or that Shawbrook Bank has breached the Financial Conduct Authoritys 
Consumer Credit sourcebook in these circumstances;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (or Shawbrook Bank);
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the loan agreements are unaffordable for 
them  Shawbrook hasnt been able to show that it properly considered whether the 
loans were affordable for them (as it should have done) but Mr and Mrs H havent 
provided the information thats been requested from them so that the affordability of 
the loans at the time that they were made can be properly assessed;
Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs H have provided enough evidence to show that 
the loan agreements were unaffordable for them at the time that the loans were 
made to them; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to end the fixed sum loan agreements, to refund to Mr and Mrs H 
any of the money that theyve paid for the replacement windows and roof trims, to pay them any other compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.
If Mr and Mrs H are suffering financial difficulties, I suggest that they contact Shawbrook 
Bank and explain those difficulties to it. Its required to respond to any such difficulties 
positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
