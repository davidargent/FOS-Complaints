The complaint
Mr J complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wouldnt refund him for an item he
bought from the UK, unless he returned it to an overseas address. Mr J said that the cost of
the return would greatly exceed what he paid.
What happened
Mr J said that he bought an item from someone hed understood to be a UK seller. The item
came with a warranty. It stopped working during the warranty period. He contacted the
seller, but they didnt reply, so Mr J asked PayPal to help. But Mr J said PayPal provided him
with an overseas address to return the item to.
Mr J said it wasnt reasonable to ask him to send this overseas. Hed bought the item from
the UK, and he wouldve been happy to return it to a UK address, but returning the item to
an overseas address would cost much more than he initially paid. Mr J said he kept trying to
explain this problem to PayPal, but it just didnt respond to him.
PayPal said that Mr J made a purchase for £34.10 on 16 February 2020. On 13 may, he filed
a dispute, saying that the item was significantly not as described. On 7 June, PayPal said
he could have a refund if he sent the item back. The address that PayPal showed us for
returns was an overseas address. On 17 June, PayPal said that as Mr J hadnt sent the item
back, he couldnt have the refund.
PayPal said it would have covered up to £15 of those return costs for Mr J. But it said
because he didnt send the item back, it had decided this claim against him.
In response, Mr J sent us screenshots of the details of the purchase hed made, which he
said showed that this item came from the UK.
Our investigator thought that this complaint should be upheld in part. She said that PayPal
hadnt told Mr J about the returns payment it offers, and she thought that if Mr J had known
about it, he would have used it. So she thought that PayPal ought to pay Mr J £15.
PayPal didnt agree. It said that information about the support it provides for returns is
available on its website, just as PayPal's buyer protection policy is. PayPal said Mr J didnt
use the service, he didnt return the item, and he didnt provide proof of return. so PayPal
didnt think he was eligible for a refund of the item under its buyer protection policy, or for a
refund of up to £15 GBP for the return cost.
But our investigator didnt change her mind. She thought that Mr J wouldve returned the
item if hed known about this service, and would have got a partial refund as a result. Our
investigator said that PayPals returns service was mentioned on its website, but not in its
user agreement, and it was very difficult to find details of the returns service without the
direct link that PayPal had sent to us. She still thought PayPal should pay £15 to Mr J.
Mr J accepted that. But PayPal didnt. It wanted this complaint to be considered by an
ombudsman. Mr J said that if this wasnt going to be resolved quickly, then he wanted the full
amount hed paid. And he stressed how difficult it had been to deal with PayPal.
This case was then passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr J said this item was purchased from a seller who advertised that they were based 
in the UK. What hes said persuades me that he hadnt intended to deal with an 
overseas seller.
I asked Mr J to send us further pictures of the advertisement for the item he 
purchased, as the initial pictures he sent were a little difficult to read. What hes sent 
now includes a clearer version of the picture hed already sent us. The two sets of 
pictures are consistent. Having looked at these pictures, I think that it was reasonable 
for Mr J to conclude that he was buying from a seller based in the UK. Although 
PayPal says this seller is based overseas, the advertisement Ive seen seems to me 
likely to give a different impression to buyers.
I note that its not actually a requirement of PayPals buyer protection, that the item 
must be returned. And because I think it was reasonable for Mr G to have concluded 
that he was dealing with a UK seller, I dont think that, in this particular case, it was 
reasonable for PayPal to ask Mr J to return this item to an overseas address. I think 
its likely that if PayPal had looked further at the claim Mr J made, it would have 
provided a refund under its buyer protection policy without asking Mr J to make a 
return. So I think that PayPal should pay Mr J the £34.10 he originally spent on this 
item, now.
I also think that Mr J has been put to a considerable amount of trouble, in making this 
complaint. So I think that PayPal should also pay Mr J £100 in compensation, to 
make up for the unnecessary trouble he has been put to.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J was delighted. He said that the sale involved bad advertising, and he felt PayPal then 
let him down. 
PayPal said it accepted my provisional decision.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposedMy final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund to Mr J £34.10 for his 
initial purchase, and pay £100 in compensation.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2021.
