The complaint
Ms G complains about how Aviva Insurance Limited (trading as HomeServe) handled her 
claim under her Plumbing and Drainage Plus policy.
What happened
On 8 August 2021, Ms G had a leak from the waste pipe under her kitchen sink. She called 
HomeServe to make a claim on her policy. Ms G says she was placed on hold by one of 
HomeServes agents for around 20 minutes. Unhappy, Ms G hung up and called 
HomeServe again. This time, one of HomeServes agents was able to open a claim for Ms 
G. However, they told Ms G that a plumber wouldnt be able to attend her property until the 
following day.
On 12 August 2021, Ms G complained to HomeServe. She said that in her first call to 
HomeServe, she was told it couldnt send anyone out to fix the leak that day. She queried 
this, saying HomeServe advertised itself as offering services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
She said after this, she was placed on hold for 20 minutes, so she had to call HomeServe 
back. Ms G said when she called, she asked to make a complaint but was told the 
complaints team werent available that day (a Sunday). 
Ms G was unhappy HomeServe hadnt sent a plumber out to fix her leak on 8 August 2021, 
which meant she couldnt go to work that day. Ms G explained she and her daughter are 
disabled and were afraid of slipping and falling because of the leak. Ms G said she was 
assured that in an emergency, a plumber would be sent to her on the day  that is why she 
bought her policy. Ms G was also unhappy she was asked to pay a £30 excess which the 
policy required before she made a claim. She says she was worried about doing this before 
the problem was fixed in case it couldnt be fixed.
HomeServe said it wasnt able to trace Ms Gs first phone call to HomeServe, in which she 
says she was placed on hold. It asked her to provide the phone number shed called from or 
the name of the agent she spoke to so it could try locating the call. It didnt uphold her 
complaint. 
Unhappy with this response, Ms G referred her complaint to our service where one of our 
investigators looked into it. He said the terms of Ms Gs policy required HomeServe to attend 
her property within a reasonable timescale  and he thought attending the next day was 
reasonable. And because HomeServe hadnt managed to find a record of the call during 
which Ms G says she was placed on hold, the investigator wasnt able to comment on what 
happened in the call.
Ms G didnt accept this. She said she also called HomeServe on 24 August 2021 and said 
the person who wrote its final response had lied in the letter because he didnt call her as he 
should have done. The person Ms G spoke to in this call said he would get his manager to 
call Ms G within 24 hours, but the manager never called. When Ms G called HomeServe 
again a few days later, she was told she would be called after the bank holiday, which also 
never happened. Ms G asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. So, its been 
passed to me to consider and make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HomeServe has confirmed it checked its records and found one call from Ms G on 
8 August 2021 at around 1.30pm. Having checked all calls in the hour before its first record 
of speaking to Ms G, HomeServe hasnt been able to find the first call where Ms G says she 
was put on hold for 20 minutes. 
Without further details, such as the name of the person Ms G spoke to, HomeServe has said 
it cant locate the call Ms G has complained about. I think HomeServe has made a 
reasonable effort to find the call. Its clear Ms G was frustrated by this first call. And its 
unclear why Ms G was put on hold for this amount of time, but claims such as this can 
sometimes take time to set up, especially as Ms G wanted a plumber to come that same day 
and there wasnt one readily available. But, without being able to locate and listen to this call, 
I dont think its fair for me to ask HomeServe to take further action in this regard.
Ms G was unhappy about being asked to pay £30 before her leak was fixed. I understand 
her point about paying before the problem is fixed in case it cant be fixed. But the problem 
was fixed in this case. And Ms Gs policy requires that if an excess is payable on the policy, 
it will need to be paid before HomeServe sends out an engineer  so I dont think 
HomeServe was wrong here.
Ms G is also unhappy she had to wait a day for a plumber to fix the leak and shed said she 
only took her policy out because she was led to believe someone would come out on the 
same day in an emergency. But the general conditions of Ms Gs policy say:
When your claim requires us to visit your property, we will attend within a reasonable 
timescale. If something beyond our control makes that impossible to keep to  well 
let you know as soon as possible and give you another time when we can visit.
Ive not seen anything in the evidence available that proves Ms G was told she could always 
have someone attend her on the day she asked for help when she took the policy. I think the 
terms of Ms Gs policy allow HomeServe to attend within a reasonable period  and I think 
attending the next day was reasonable in the circumstances. 
I note Ms G said HomeServes agent lied in its final response of 16 August 2021, and should 
have called her. However, all of this relates to HomeServes subsequent handling of the 
complaint. Complaint handling isnt an activity which our service is able to consider. So, I 
cant comment on this part further. 
My final decision
Whilst I appreciate Ms G feels very strongly about this matter, for the reasons explained 
above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
