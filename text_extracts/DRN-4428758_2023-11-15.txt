The complaint
Mr B complains that Nationwide Building Society lent irresponsibly when it approved various 
loans. 
What happened
In February 2016 Mr B applied for a £20,000 loan over 70 months with Nationwide to 
purchase a car. Nationwide says Mr B gave an income of £2,500 a month and used a 
household outgoings figure of £610 plus £88 for council tax and £500 for mortgage 
payments. Nationwide says it carried out a credit search and found Mr B had repayments of 
£290 a month that wouldnt be impacted by the loan application. Nationwide says it 
calculated Mr B had £911 disposable income which showed the new loan, with a payment of 
£380, was affordable. The loan was approved.
In May 2017 Mr B applied for a second loan, this time for £2,000 over 44 months. 
Nationwide says Mr B declared an income of £2,400 a month in this application and that it 
used a household expenditure figure of £595 plus £85 council tax a month. Nationwide says 
it used a mortgage payment of £400 a month plus credit card minimum payments of £258 
and existing loan payments of £612. Nationwide calculated Mr B had around £481 available 
which was sufficient to cover his new loan payments of £58. The loan was approved. 
In April 2018 Mr B applied for a top up loan of £12,150 over 70 months. Nationwide says Mr 
B gave an income figure of £2,250 a month and that it used a figure of £606 for regular 
outgoings plus £114 for council tax. Nationwide says it used mortgage costs of £300 a 
month, credit card payments of £430 a month and existing loan payments of £376 a month. 
Nationwide says Mr B had surplus income of £422.66 which was sufficient to cover his new 
loan payment of £219.26. The loan was approved. 
In January 2019 Mr B applied for another top up loan, this time for £1,500 over 84 months. 
Nationwide recorded an income figure of £2,500 and used a regular outgoings figure of £643 
plus £118 for council tax. Nationwide found credit card payments of £200 plus existing loan 
payments of £734. Nationwide says that left Mr B with £448 as disposable income which 
was sufficient to cover his increased loan payment of £30. 
Last year, Mr B complained that Nationwide had lent irresponsibly and it issued a final 
response. Nationwide said it had carried out reasonable checks each time Mr B applied 
before deciding whether to lend and that the loans were all affordable based on what if 
found. Nationwide added Mr B had settled some of the loans early and didnt agree it had 
lent irresponsibly. 
Mr B referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. In its file 
submission, Nationwide said Mr B had waited too long to refer his complaint about the 
February 2016 loan application to us which meant we couldnt consider the merits. Another 
ombudsman went on to issue a decision that confirmed Mr Bs complaint about the February 
2016 (and later applications) fell within the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service. The 
case was passed back to the investigator to review. 
The investigator upheld Mr Bs complaint and said that Nationwide had failed to provide 
evidence to support the lending decisions it made. The investigator reviewed the case based 
on the evidence on file, in line with our remit. The investigator wasnt persuaded that 
Nationwide had shown it lent responsibly or carried out proportionate checks before 
approving Mr Bs loan applications and upheld his complaint. 
On 6 October 2023 Nationwide requested an extension to 18 October 2023 in order to reply. 
Despite a further chase on 20 October 2023 we didnt hear back from Nationwide. On 31 
October 2023 the investigator contacted both parties to say Mr Bs case would be passed to 
an ombudsman as Nationwide had failed to respond and gave a final response date of 14 
November 2023. On 8 November 2023 Nationwide said it would respond by 10 November 
2023. We didnt hear back from Nationwide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before providing credit, lenders need to complete reasonable and proportionate affordability 
checks. There isnt a set list of checks a lender is required to carry out, but it needs to 
ensure the checks are proportionate when considering things like: the type and amount of 
credit being provided, the size of the regular repayments, the total cost of the credit and the 
consumers circumstances.
In its initial submission, Nationwide gave us some information about the figures it used when 
assessing Mr Bs loan applications. Whilst the information is reasonably detailed, it wasnt 
backed up by any evidence to show what Nationwide found during the applications Mr B 
made or how the applications were scored by its systems. Ive looked at the information on 
file, including a copy of Mr Bs credit file and his bank statements for the periods surrounding 
his applications. 
Mr Bs first application in February 2016 was for £20,000, a substantial sum. I havent been 
persuaded that Nationwides submissions have provided clear grounds to verify the checks it 
completed were proportionate. But Mr B hasnt submitted any statements to cover the period 
either. Whilst I understand Mr B is unhappy with the loan that was approved, the figures 
provided by Nationwide indicate the repayments were affordable. On balance, I havent been 
persuaded the February 2016 loan was irresponsibly approved by Nationwide. 
Mr B went back to Nationwide for a further £2,000 in September 2017. At this point, Mr Bs 
income figure had dropped to £2,400. I note Nationwide used lower figures for Mr Bs 
mortgage costs and regular outgoings than in the previous application. As Nationwide hasnt 
supplied evidence of its lending decisions, its not clear why. But by this time, Mr Bs regular 
payments for credit had increased as he owed around £45,000 in unsecured debt. That 
meant Mr B was paying around £790 a month to service loan repayments plus around £475 
for credit card payments. Added to the regular outgoings of £595 and mortgage costs of 
£400 Nationwide used, that only left around £60 a month after Mr Bs outgoings were 
factored. Im not persuaded that was a sustainable position for Mr B in the long term. I agree 
with the investigator that Nationwide would most likely have declined Mr Bs loan application 
in September 2017 if had taken a closer look at his circumstances and obtained further 
evidence. By the time Mr B applied again in April 2018 and January 2019 I think it shouldve been 
reasonably clear to Nationwide hed become reliant on credit to make ends meet. In the 
circumstances, I think Nationwide shouldve carried out better checks, like verifying Mr Bs 
income or reviewing his bank statements. Mr Bs bank statements from the period show that 
he was gambling a substantial amount each month. In the circumstances, if Nationwide had 
carried out more comprehensive checks, I think it wouldve declined to proceed with the loan 
applications Mr B made in April 2018 and January 2019. Taking all the available information 
into account, Im satisfied Nationwide lent irresponsibly when it approved the loans in April 
2018 and January 2019. 
As I havent seen evidence that supports Nationwide carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks when assessing the loan applications Mr B made in May 2017, April 
2018 and January 2019 and the information available indicates it lent irresponsibly, Im 
upholding his complaint and directing it to refund all interest, fees and charges applied. Im 
not telling Nationwide to take any further action in relation to the loan approved in February 
2016. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct Nationwide Building Society to settle 
as follows: 
- Add the total amount of money Mr B received as a result of the loans approved in 
May 2017, April 2018 and January 2019. The repayments Mr B made to these loans 
should be deducted from this amount.
- If this results in Mr B having paid more than he received then any overpayments 
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated from the date the 
overpayments were made until the date of settlement.) 
Or
- If any capital balance remains outstanding, Nationwide should attempt to arrange an 
affordable/suitable repayment plan with Mr B
- Once the balance has been cleared, remove any adverse information recorded on Mr 
Bs credit file in relation to the May 2017, April 2018 and January 2019 loans
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Nationwide to take off tax from this interest. Nationwide 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2023.
