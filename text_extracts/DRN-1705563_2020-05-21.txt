DRN-1705563
The complaint
Mrs S complains that the amount Capital One (Europe) plc collects to cover her credit card 
payment can change after the statement has been received. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
I understand Mr Z, on Mrs S behalf, says Capital Ones process of claiming direct 
debit payments is not logical and wants it to put a cut off date in to ensure the 
amount it collects is the same as shown in the statement. But Capital One is free to 
decide how to collect payments and whether to reduce the amount due to reflect 
refunds made to the credit card. 
Capital One confirms it claims the direct debit payment a few days before the due 
date to ensure cleared funds are received in time. 
Capital One hasnt made an error in this case and has collected Mrs S payment in 
line with its normal processes. 
Im satisfied Capital one has dealt with Mrs S complaint fairly, so Im not telling it to 
do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2020.
