The complaint
Mr Y is unhappy with ClearScore Technology Limited trading as ClearScores handling of
two disputes he raised about information on his credit file.
What happened
I spoke with Mr Y and he clarified his complaint is about two queries he raised with
ClearScore:
Query one
In June 2021, Mr Y raised a query with ClearScore about information a company, P, were
recording on his credit file. Mr Y told us he managed to resolve the issues himself, which
cost him money, as he felt ClearScore didnt help him with this.
Query two
In February 2022, ClearScore received a query from Mr Y about a default that was
registered in 2017 by a bank C. Mr Y said he told C he was prepared to pay the
outstanding amount, but they didnt allow him to do this. So, Mr Y asked ClearScore to
remove the default from his credit file as he doesnt feel it should be on there.
ClearScore said they received both queries and, on both occasions, they forwarded Mr Ys
query on to the credit reference agency (CRA) E for them to investigate further. ClearScore
explained they did this because E are the party who hold the credit information. Whereas,
ClearScore simply allow their customers access to view this data and arent able to amend
any data on a credit report.
Our Investigator looked into Mr Ys concerns about the query he raised in relation to C. In
summary, he thought ClearScore did what they could to help Mr Y and as they arent 
responsible for the information showing on Mr Ys credit file, he didnt think ClearScore had
acted unfairly in not removing the information in relation to C.
Mr Y disagreed with our Investigators view and didnt feel wed investigated matters
properly. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision on the matter, setting out the below:
To explain further, ClearScore themselves are not a CRA, rather they provide credit
information and broking services. ClearScores reports allow their customers to see what
information is being reported about them by lenders and other companies, through the CRA
- E. ClearScores website sets out that if a customer feels incorrect information is appearing
on their credit file, the first thing they should do is let the company or lender of that account
know. A customer can also raise a dispute with ClearScore which will then go to E to
investigate. Its common for E to contact the original lender or company of the account the
dispute is raised about as part of their investigations.
ClearScore provided us with information showing that when Mr Y submitted query one to
them in June 2021, this was forwarded to E and Mr Y was provided with instructions for
tracking this dispute with E. I think ClearScore acted fairly in doing this as they did what was
expected in raising Mr Ys dispute with E. I note Mr Y wrote to ClearScore again following
them raising this query and said E were useless, but I cant hold ClearScore responsible for
Es actions. Nor can I comment on whether E acted fairly in this decision.
Mr Y raised another query about several matters, which included his account with P, in
August 2021. I can see Mr Y made references to trying to get a response from E and he felt
he wasnt being helped. But ClearScore told Mr Y that they forwarded his query on to E
which is whats expected of them. I can see from these communications Mr Y also
mentioned the defaulted account with C. So, it seems to me this query was raised before it
was raised again in February 2022 (query two above). Nonetheless, Mr Y told ClearScore in
September 2021 that E told him they contacted C about the defaulted account. So, I think its
fair to suggest ClearScore did what they needed to do by passing on this dispute - it seems
E were investigating things further for Mr Y. With that said, I think ClearScore acted
reasonably when explaining to Mr Y that as this dispute was with E, ClearScore considered
Mr Ys case with them to be closed  there wasnt anything else ClearScore needed to do.
While ClearScore forwarded query two to E in February 2022 when Mr Y contacted them
about this again, ClearScore told us they realised an error was made by their agents as they
said they shouldnt have forwarded this dispute on to E. ClearScore said this was because
the defaulted account with C was from 2017 - defaults stay on a credit report for six years
and cant be removed unless they werent meant to be there in the first place. While I realise
ClearScore have said they could have told Mr Y sooner that a dispute with E wasnt going to
be successful, Mr Y said he wanted the default with C removed and didnt want it to be on
his credit file. So, Mr Y would have always needed to have taken matters up with C about
getting the default removed, as they are the data owners. With that in mind, I dont think it
was necessarily wrong for ClearScore to forward this dispute to E, but I appreciate
ClearScore could have better explained things to Mr Y. ClearScore apologised for any
inconvenience caused to Mr Y in relation to this and I think this is fair. Therefore, I currently
wont be asking ClearScore to do anything more.
ClearScore responded and accepted my provisional decision. Mr Y didnt provide me with 
any further comments or new information to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party have provided me with further information to consider, I see no reason to 
depart from my provisional decision. To summarise, I think ClearScore could have provided 
clearer explanations to Mr Y when they received his query in February 2022. But, that's 
different from them doing something wrong - and overall, I dont think ClearScore did 
anything wrong in the handling of Mr Ys queries.
My final decision
For reasons explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2023.
