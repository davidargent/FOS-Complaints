K820x#14Complaint
Miss B complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA  (PayPal) suspended access to 
her account  before closing it and refused to release funds it held on her behalf without 
explaining why. 
Background
Miss B sold items via an online auction and used  her PayPal account to receive  payments. 
On 6 February 2019 PayPal decided to review  Miss Bs account. On 22 February 2019 it 
took the decision to permanently limit access to the account. PayPal also said Miss B 
couldnt withdraw the balance of Â£962.32  for a period of 180 days. 
Miss B complained to PayPal but says it didnt respond so she contacted our service. After  
we got in touch with PayPal it responded to Miss Bs complaint on 3 April 2019. PayPal said 
the agreement  Miss B had accepted when she set up her account  allowed it to limit access if 
it had concerns over the way it had been  operated. PayPal also said that its terms allowed it 
to place a hold on the account which meant  it wouldnt release the balance  until 
12 July 2019.  
An adjudicator at our service looked  at Miss Bs complaint but thought  PayPal had dealt with 
it fairly.  He said that PayPals terms meant  it could restrict account  access  and the funds 
held on Miss Bs behalf. The adjudicator  said that PayPal had shared information in 
confidence with us about its decision but he couldnt  share that with Miss B. 
In response, Miss B gave  her view of why PayPal had taken the step of limiting  her account. 
Miss B explained she had been  in hospital which had led to some  transactions  being 
refunded but felt PayPals decision was unfair. Miss B was particularly frustrated that PayPal  
refused to release her funds for around six months. Miss B asked to appeal so her complaint 
has been passed to me to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Miss B is frustrated.  PayPal has told her about its decision but has 
only provided a limited amount of information explaining why it suspended  her account. 
Whilst I understand why Miss B wants to know the reasons behind PayPals decision, I cant 
force it to share that information. PayPals terms mean it can review a customers account 
use and decide  whether  to continue its relationship and providing payment services.  The 
terms dont say that PayPal has to provide  a full explanation of its reasons. 
In this case, PayPal  says its taken the decision to end its relationship  with Miss B because,  
after a review, it was concerned the account represented a potential  risk, as set out in 
section 9.1 of its terms of use. Ive looked  carefully  at the terms and they allow PayPal to 
suspend, block,  limit or close  Miss Bs account if it has reason  to believe she has engaged in 
what it calls a restricted activity. 
Ref: DRN07672022PayPal has sent us information that goes into the reasons behind its decision. I can see it 
reviewed the way Miss Bs PayPal account operated and took the step to limit access  and 
end its relationship. PayPal has already told Miss B that it believed  the account  represented  
a risk which is why it took the decision to limit access and ultimately close  it. Thats a 
decision PayPal is entitled to take and our service cant force it to continue  where  it believes 
there is a risk. 
The information PayPal  sent us relating to its investigation has been provided in confidence 
as its commercially  sensitive. I understand why Miss B wants  to know more  about the 
decision but Im satisfied the information  is sensitive in nature and that PayPal has raised a 
reasonable objection to it being shared. Whilst I cant go into the specifics  of PayPals 
investigation, Im satisfied that its decision  to limit access and close  the account was 
reasonable and in line with its terms of service. 
Miss B has raised concerns that PayPal refused to release  the outstanding balance  to her 
for 180 days.  But PayPals terms say that it can block  an account and hold the funds for as 
long as reasonably needed to protect  it against a risk of financial loss. Im satisfied PayPal 
was allowed to delay  releasing the balance to Miss B. 
Miss B says PayPal didnt  settle fees that were  due to an online auction  service during the 
period in question. But PayPal told Miss B it had suspended her account  and was holding 
the funds it contained. I think it was clear from what PayPal told Miss B that she wouldnt be 
able to use her account for transactions while access was suspended.  I wouldnt expect  
PayPal to settle the fees due to a third party during the period Miss Bs account was 
suspended. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Miss B but I havent found that PayPal has made a mistake. PayPal 
reviewed Miss Bs account and said it believed it represented a risk. PayPals terms of 
service say it can limit access to an account  where  it believes there is a risk and Im satisfied 
thats a decision  its entitled to make. Whilst I understand Miss B wants a better explanation 
behind its decision,  I cant force PayPal to provide commercially sensitive information.  But 
Im satisfied PayPal has acted in line with its terms in this case and that its dealt with 
Miss Bs complaint fairly. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 January 2020.
