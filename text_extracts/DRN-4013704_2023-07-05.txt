The complaint
Mrs A has complained that her adviser at Quilter Financial Services Limited (Quilter) has 
coerced her into making payments and money has been taken from her bank account 
without her permission. Mrs A says the investments have performed badly and she has 
suffered a loss of £100,000. As a result, she has a shortfall in her monthly income which she 
needs to finance her retirement.
What happened
Mrs A had an ISA account and Collective Investment Account (CIA) with Quilter. The advice 
to invest had been given by a different business so Quilter is not liable for any advice prior to 
Mrs A becoming a client in October 2017. In October 2017 the CIA was valued at £120,338 
and the ISA at £104,393. Mrs A was withdrawing £1,000 each month. 
In December 2021 Mrs As adviser  an appointed representative of Quilter  decided to no 
longer offer his services to Mrs A as he considered her to be vulnerable and didnt wish to 
advise her without a third-party present. As a result, Mrs A closed her account. 
Mrs A was concerned about actions taken on her account and raised a complaint with 
Quilter. In its response to Mrs As complaint it said the following;
It provided a timeline of events of Mrs As accounts and detailed all the cash 
movements.
Mrs A had made an overall profit.
It explained the fees and charges that had been incurred on the account. 
Its opinion was based on the documentary evidence available. It didnt uphold the 
complaint. 
Mrs A wasnt happy with the outcome and Quilter brought her complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman. Our investigator who considered the complaint didnt think it should be upheld. 
He said;
He gave background to some the cash movements on the account and its value over 
the years  transfers from the CIA to the ISA, the reduction in value because of the 
withdrawals from her CIA, impact of the pandemic, costs for a new house etc.
Mrs A had fully encashed her CIA and when the relationship with her adviser ended, 
she fully encashed the remaining investment in her ISA and transferred the funds to 
her current bank account.
He couldnt see there was anything to suggest that money was taken from her 
account other than withdrawals he had identified which appeared to have been at her 
own request. He couldnt see her adviser had recommended she make the 
withdrawals that she did.
Money taken out of Mrs As account was a combination or withdrawals and adviser 
fees. He couldnt see that Quilter had done anything wrong. 
Mrs A didnt agree with the investigator and requested her complaint be decided by an 
ombudsman, so it has been passed to me. Mrs A provided further submission for my 
consideration. In particular she said;
A payment date of £40,00 didnt tally with her bank statement. Quilter said it had 
taken place over a weekend which Mrs A thought was a failure and omission in 
Quilters accounting records.
In assessing the encashment, contributions she had made were summarised as 
payments out.
As her bank balances were being manipulated all investment was being converted 
back to Quilter and no growth was credited to her account. The figure of £84,000 
quoted by the investigator was a profit for Quilter and not her.
Encashment proceeds had been withheld by Quilter. 
She referred to the opening balance on her account of £269,396 and an additional 
contribution of £220,000 which she said hadnt been taken into account by the 
investigator. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After doing so, I have reached the same conclusion as the investigator and broadly for the 
same reasons. I appreciate that Mrs A has been very worried about her account and the 
impact on her finances in retirement, so Ill explain why I have reached the conclusion that I 
have. 
Both parties to the complaint are aware of all the deposits in and withdrawals from the 
account so I wont detail them again here. But I have reviewed them and will comment as I 
consider necessary. 
I should point out that Mrs A has also complained complaint about Quilter Investment 
Platform (QIP) which holds her account. This complaint is being dealt with separately, but I 
make reference to QIP in this decision as appropriate.  
Mrs As account with the predecessor of QIP began in November 2014. The investment 
advice was given by a previous firm and it was in October 2017 that Mrs As new adviser  
an appointed representative of Quilter  took over. As such while Quilter might have 
information about Mrs As account prior to October 2017 it was only responsible for any 
advice or management of the account after that date. 
Mrs A initially invested £220,000 into her CIA in 2014. When Quilter became responsible for 
Mrs As portfolio in October 2014 her CIA was valued at £120,338 and her ISA at £104,393  
a total of £247,731. Mrs A was taking a monthly income of £1,000 from the CIA.
Over the years Mrs A used her CIA (plus surplus cash in some instances) to fund her ISA on 
an annual basis. She also continued to take a monthly income from the account between 
January 2015 and June 2020. These amounts varied between £1,000 and £1,500. The total 
amount taken in regular withdrawals was £84,150. There were other one-off withdrawals.
In July 2020 Mrs A removed the remaining cash in her account - £57,937.88 to help finance 
the cost of a house purchase. The remainder of £22,062 needed for the house purchase was taken from her ISA account, leaving the ISA valued at £113,588. From then, the income 
payments were taken from the ISA and were reduced to £700 per month. 
Mrs A financed her 2020/21 ISA from surplus cash of £20,000 which took the value of her 
ISA to £134,136. In June 2021 Mrs A paid in a further £19,400 to her ISA which was valued 
at £162,565. And in December 2021 Mrs A encashed her ISA, the resulting £167,232.72 
was sent to her bank account. 
So, despite the depletion of capital by one-off and regular withdrawals, its clear Mrs A made 
an overall gain during the six years since 2014 which suggests her portfolio hasnt performed 
badly.
Ive cross referenced some of the withdrawals from the CIA and ISA and Mrs As bank 
statements she has given us and I cant find any discrepancies in the amounts withdrawn 
from the portfolios and the amounts paid into Mrs As bank accounts. While I accept the 
number of bank statements Mrs A has given us is limited and I havent been able to carry out 
a full review, I have nothing to suggest any fraudulent activity has taken place or that any 
funds have been syphoned off and returned to Quilter. 
Mrs A has referred to the opening balance on her account of £269,396 and an additional 
contribution of £220,000 which hadnt been taken into account by the investigator. 
Mrs A has provided us with a schedule of Investment Advice charges Analysis and I can 
see there is a statement valuing the Combined Portfolio at £269,396 in November 2014. I 
cant see where that statement originated but it includes a bond with another product 
provider as well valued at £87,588 and the [previous adviser]/Quilter investment valued at 
£181,808. So, I think its unlikely this ties in with the amount Mrs A recollects depositing with 
Quilter at inception of her CIA with Quilter. It was a valuation of her overall investments. 
And I note from Mrs As bank statements that a cheque for £220,000 was debited from her 
current account on 6 November 2014. Prior to that, on 4 November 2014 there is a credit of 
£138,872.31 from her previous adviser which partially funded the £220,000 payment. So, Im 
satisfied, from the information that I have been given that Mrs As initial deposit from her 
bank account into the CIA was £220,000 so I think what Quilter has told us is most likely 
correct.
For the ISA I can see there was a one-off deposit at the inception of the account in 
November 2014 of £15,306.12 and a further transfer in from another product provider in 
December 2014 of £58,243.02. This was topped up over the years using transfers from the 
CIA and surplus funds provided by Mrs A. 
Mrs A has referred to a payment of £40,000 which she has queried. I can see from a letter 
dated 21 May 2020 that Quilter confirmed that the statements which were enclosed 
October 2017 to July 2018  detailed two £20,000 top-ups into her ISA account. One from a 
cheque dated 14 February 2018 and another with a payment date of 27 July 2018 which 
resulted from a bed and ISA transaction. From what I can see from Mrs A annotations on 
that letter she considers that those payments were made by her via cheque. 
A cheque for £20,000 was paid out of her bank statement on 28 June 2021 which is 
recorded as a payment into her ISA on 25 June 2021. Mrs A has queried the discrepancy in 
dates between the two. I note those dates do fall over a weekend, so I think what Quilter has 
said about this is likely and credits/debits recorded by two parties might not be exactly the 
same. The figure of £19,400 was recorded on Mrs As ISA statement and Quilter has 
confirmed that £600 was debited from the £20,000 as charges which Im satisfied clears up 
any questions about the discrepancy in the two amounts. Ive reviewed the correspondence from Mrs As adviser withdrawing his services. And I know 
that Mrs A was unhappy about this. But the adviser explained his reasons  he assessed her 
as being a vulnerable customer and he had to comply with certain regulatory obligations 
because of that. So I cant agree that he did anything wrong even though I recognise the 
impact this had on Mrs A. 
I appreciate that Mrs A has been very worried about her investments. But taking all of the 
above into account I cant agree that Quilter has done anything wrong. I have seen nothing 
to suggest that any fraudulent activity has taken place in the account. From the cash 
movements Ive been able to review there is nothing that has caused me concern or made 
me consider that any cash has been removed or transferred without Mrs As knowledge and 
agreement. And in spite of the withdrawals, Mrs As portfolio was profitable over the time that 
it was with Quilter. 
Overall, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint and I wont be asking Quilter to do anything further. 
I do appreciate that Mrs A will no doubt be disappointed with the outcome that I have 
reached but I hope I have been able to explain sufficiently so that she understands why. 
My final decision
For the reasons given, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 August 2023.
