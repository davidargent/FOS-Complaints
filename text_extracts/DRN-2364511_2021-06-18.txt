The complaint
Miss S made a claim of fraud to National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) after she lost her 
purse and noticed transactions on her account, she says she didnt make. She is unhappy 
because NatWest originally declined her claim and closed her bank account. She feels it 
treated her unfairly in the process.
  
What happened
Miss S told us she lost her purse on a bus on her way to work on 4 February 2019. Miss S 
said that as soon as she realised her purse was missing, she went to her nearest branch to 
report her card lost. The branch printed off Miss Ss bank statement and she highlighted a 
number of transactions going back to 1 February 2019 that she told NatWest she didnt 
recognise as being one she had made.
NatWest originally decided to hold Miss S liable for the disputed transactions because it said 
she had made multiple fraud complaints since having an account with NatWest and 
because this was her third compromised card since May 2018. It also said that the pattern 
of spending didnt fit typical point of PIN compromise for the chip and PIN transaction. On 12 
February 2019, NatWest gave Ms S 60 days notice of account closure.
During our investigation, Miss S told our investigator she had made a mistake over the 
number of original disputed transactions. As it had been a while, she said she had found it 
difficult to pinpoint exactly when the first disputed transaction had taken place. She said 
there may have been some confusion at the time of reporting the disputed transactions as 
she was stressed about the situation. She said the original statement print out did not 
include locations of transactions which had made it more difficult to pin point when the 
disputed transactions started.
Having established a new point for the first disputed transaction, our investigator upheld the 
complaint and NatWest agreed to pay the £29.49 in disputed transactions along with any 
associated overdraft charges from the transactions. Our investigator also considered 
whether NatWest should pay Miss S any trouble and upset but felt that none was due. This 
was because the investigator considered there was a misunderstanding between the parties 
about which were the actual disputed transactions, and she didnt think it was solely 
NatWests fault.
Miss S feels she was treated unfairly and doesnt agree that NatWest should have closed 
her account  although she does say that shes not interested in having an account with 
NatWest again. Miss S is unhappy about the way she was spoken to by a member of staff 
over the phone whilst she was in the branch. She was extremely stressed at the time due to 
personal circumstances. 
Miss S also had an overdraft at the time of the account closure and says she has since been 
harassed by three different debt recovery companies. Miss S feels she should not have to 
pay back her overdraft and should be compensated for the embarrassment, distress and 
humiliation caused.
As the case could not be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision.
Im sorry for the length of time it has taken for Miss Ss case to reach me for a final decision 
and I thank both parties for their patience.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same conclusion as the investigator broadly for the same 
reasons.
There appears to be a genuine misunderstanding around the circumstances of the fraud 
claim between the two parties. I believe this played a part in NatWest originally declining to 
refund the disputed transactions to Miss S. 
Miss S submitted the claim for fraud and highlighted the transactions to NatWest. NatWest 
assessed Miss Ss claim for the full transactions going back to 1 February 2019 based on 
what she had told them. 
I can understand why the information available to NatWest when assessing the claim caused 
them to decline it. One of the mistakenly highlighted disputed transactions was a chip and 
PIN payment, despite there being no point of PIN compromise. This was alongside a pattern 
of spending over several days that wasnt typical of fraudulent activity. So, I dont think it was 
unreasonable of NatWest to have declined the claim in those circumstances.
Having revisited which transactions Miss S is disputing, NatWest has now agreed to refund 
the £29.49 she is now claiming. Because both parties have agreed with this aspect of the 
complaint, I see no reason to go into further detail other than to say, I believe this is a fair 
and reasonable outcome in the circumstances of this complaint for the reasons already 
outlined by the investigator.
Turning to the closure of Miss Ss account, I have noted that Miss S would not want another 
account with NatWest, but I have considered whether NatWest did anything wrong when it 
closed Miss Ss account. 
Banks sometimes choose to end their relationship with customers. This can be due to a 
number of reasons  and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the customer. Just the 
same as if Miss S decided to stop banking with NatWest, she wouldnt have to tell them why. 
While NatWest was entitled to close Miss Ss account  it must do so in line with the Terms 
and Conditions. Ive reviewed the Terms and Conditions and Im satisfied that NatWest 
acted fairly when giving Miss S 60 days notice to close her account. NatWest exercised its 
right to no longer offer Miss S banking facilities and Ive seen nothing to suggest NatWest 
has made an unfair decision. So, I wont be asking NatWest to do anything differently.
I appreciate Miss S is unhappy she has been chased for the £249.24 debt she owed to 
NatWest. This is money Miss S has had the benefit of, so I think its right that she repays 
this. Ive gone on to consider whether NatWest did anything wrong as part of this process.
I can see NatWest wrote to Miss S on 29 April 2019 because it had been unable to make a 
suitable arrangement with her regarding the debt. It explained it was passing the debt on to a 
third-party collection agent. On the 30 May 2019, the third-party debt collector wrote to Miss 
S offering a settlement offer or alternative repayment options on behalf of NatWest. It seems 
Miss S made did not engage about possible repayment arrangements. So, I dont think it 
was unreasonable of NatWest to pass the debt on to a third party in the circumstances.I do understand that Miss S feels strongly, and I dont doubt that the events she has 
described have caused her distress and inconvenience. I know Miss S will be disappointed 
by this outcome, but I can only make an award for distress and inconvenience if the 
business did something wrong or made a mistake. I cant safely say that it has here.
 
My final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is I uphold this complaint in part and require 
NatWest to pay Miss S £29.49 along with any associated overdraft charges from the 
transactions.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 July 2021.
