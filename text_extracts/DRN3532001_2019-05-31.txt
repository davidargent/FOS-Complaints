K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  about loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Pounds  to Pocket P2P) 
lent to her. She says the loans were irresponsibly lent.
background
I issued my provisional decision in March  2019 where I set out a detailed  background to this 
complaint. This provisional decision is attached as an appendix at the end of this decision 
and it forms part of my final decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I asked Miss B and P2P to let me have their comments on my provisional  decision by the 
deadline provided. The deadline  has now passed  and P2P has responded to say it had 
nothing further  to add. Miss B hasnt provided  any further comments.
As neither has disagreed with my provisional findings, I see no reason to depart of the 
conclusions I previously  reached.
my final decision
I do not uphold  Miss Bs complaint  and make no award against CashEuroNet  UK LLC
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 July 2019.

extracts  from my provisional  decision
background
Miss B took two instalment loans with P2P from March 2014 to August 2015.  The loan amounts  
varied from £50 to £300  and from the information P2P has provided, the loans were  as follows.
loan number date taken amount date repaid
1 31/03/14 £300 31/03/15
1a 04/04/14 £150 31/03/15
1b 20/04/14 £100 31/03/15
1c 25/04/14 £50 31/03/15
2 27/08/15 £200 28/08/15
Miss B topped   up her borrowing on loan 1 three times  and repaid the loan including the topups 
within 12 months  of the original advance. Miss Bs maximum payments for loan 1 varied from around 
£55 to £102 over 12 monthly repayments.
There was about a five month break between when Miss B repaid loan 1 and when she borrowed 
loan 2. Loan  2 was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments  but I can see that Miss B repaid it 
within one month.
When Miss B complained to P2P through a third party representative,  it didnt uphold  her 
complaint. It said it carried out sufficient  checks before lending to her and didnt think  she was 
dependent on the loans. Miss B didnt accept the outcome of P2Ps  investigation and referred the 
complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint  and ultimately thought that P2Ps checks on loan 1 
went far enough but it should have done more before agreeing to lend loan 2. And had it carried  out 
further checks, its likely to have found that Miss B was unable to afford the loan and it shouldnt have 
lent to it her.
P2P didnt agree  with our adjudication and asked  for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. And so the complaint has come  to me  an ombudsman for a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken  into account  the law, any relevant  regulatory  
rules and good industry practice at the time the loans  were offered.
P2P needed to carry out proportionate  checks to see that Miss B could sustainably  afford  to make 
her loan repayments  before agreeing to lend.  Its checks needed  to be customer focussed and could 
take into account  things like the size and length of the loan and what it knew about the customer.
P2P has provided information to show that before it lent any of the loans to Miss B, it
checked her income and normal living  expenses. It also searched her credit file and checked her 
employment and housing status. I can also see from the email correspondence  that P2P asked 
Miss B for a copy of her bank statement or payslip before agreeing to lend loan 1.
At the time, Miss B was employed and renting. She declared her income as £1,280  throughout the 
lending relationship and her total declared expenses throughout the lending was £525  this 
included housing - £150, utilities - £75, transport - £50, food - £75, other credit commitments £150 
and other  expenses  - £25.
Ref: DRN35320013P2P has provided a summary of its search into Miss Bs credit file and Miss B has also provided  a 
copy of her credit file and I can see that there  were  no defaults  or county  court judgements  (CCJs) 
recorded on her file at the time.
were P2Ps  checks sufficient/proportionate?
Loan 1 was for £300 and Miss B was due to repay it over 11 monthly instalments with the highest 
repayment amount of around  £56. Given that it was her first loan and the maximum  repayment 
represented a small portion  of her declared  income, I think P2Ps checks went far enough. Also 
Miss Bs declared expenses suggest that she could  afford the loan repayments over the term.
A few days later she took out loan 1a although  she hadnt repaid any of the capital she 
borrowed on loan 1. This meant  that her debt increased and she was now due to repay around 
£80 monthly  over a period of 12 months. I think P2Ps checks here also went  far enough  and 
the checks  suggest  that Miss B could afford the loan repayments.
I can see that Miss B took out two further top  ups without repaying any of the capital and this 
meant that by loan 1c, she had borrowed £600 and was due to make monthly repayments of 
around £105  for 12 months. Again for both loans 1b and 1c, I think P2Ps  checks  went  far enough  
and those checks  suggest Miss B could afford the loan repayment.
For loans 1 to 1c, the maximum loan repayment  amounts were small  compared  to Miss Bs 
declared income and from the information Ive seen, Im not persuaded  that P2P should have been 
prompted to take its checks further at this stage especially as it was early  in the lending  
relationship.
Miss B took out loan 2 almost five months after fully repaying all her borrowing on loan 1 including  its 
top  ups. Loan 2 was for £200  to be repaid in six monthly instalments of around £57.
I can see that Miss B had one late payment charge  before she borrowed loan 2 but I dont think  
this shouldve caused P2P to take its checks further.  I say this because Miss B was now 
borrowing less than the capital amount  on her previous borrowing and this loan was due to be 
repaid in six monthly instalments  a shorter term than her previous loan. Also,  the loan 
repayments represented a small  portion of her income  and given  that she declared her expenses  
as £550, it was reasonable for P2P to believe  that she could sustainably  afford the loan 
repayment.
In summary,  I dont think P2P did anything wrong by giving Miss B any of the loans. I think its 
checks for each loan went far enough and suggested that Miss B could  afford  the loan repayments 
in a sustainable manner.
