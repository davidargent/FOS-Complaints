The complaint
Mrs A is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont reimburse her for an item she 
paid for but which she never received under their Buyer Protection Scheme.
What happened
Mrs A bought a TV for which she paid £680 using her PayPal account. Mrs A went to collect 
the TV with the intention of scanning a QR code provided by PayPal as proof that she had 
received the item. However, when Mrs A arrived to collect the TV, she noticed it was 
damaged and so didnt accept it and left it with the seller. 
Mrs A asked the seller to refund the money shed paid for the TV, but the seller refused. So, 
Mrs A asked PayPal to reimburse the money shed paid for the item shed never received via 
their Buyer Protection Scheme. But PayPal said that Mrs A wasnt covered by their scheme 
and so refused her request. Mrs A wasnt happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal responded to Mrs A and said that because she had gone to collect the TV, she 
wasnt covered by their Buyer Protection Scheme. Mrs A wasnt satisfied with PayPals 
response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that PayPals Buyer Protection 
Scheme did provide protection to customers who collected items and used a QR code to 
confirm collection. Mrs A had a QR code, but because the TV was damaged and she didnt 
take it, she didnt use it. As such, our investigator didnt feel it was fair that PayPal would 
decline Mrs As claim and they recommended that PayPal reimburse Mrs A the £680 she 
had paid along with a further £50 as compensation for the trouble and upset PayPal had 
caused her by not accepting her claim.
PayPal didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forward by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied from the information presented to this service that Mrs A did go to collect the TV 
that she paid for but that she didnt accept the TV because it was in a damaged state and 
that she left the TV with the seller.
PayPal have said that Mrs A isnt eligible for a reimbursement of the £680 she paid the seller 
because she went to collect the item. This is because PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme 
stipulates that a claim wont be successful if a buyer collects a bought item in person.
But PayPals terms also stipulate that the in-person collection exemption doesnt apply if a 
QR code is used to confirm collection. And Mrs A had a QR code, which Im satisfied from 
her testimony she intended to use, but which she reasonably and understandably didnt use 
because she ultimately didnt collect the TV, having seen that it was damaged.
It seems unfair to me that PayPal would, in all likelihood, as per the terms of their Buyer 
Protection Scheme, have honoured Mrs As claim if shed scanned the QR code  confirming 
collection of the damaged TV  and then claimed a reimbursement on the basis that the TV 
was damaged and so was received by her significantly not as described.
In the scenario described above, Mrs A would have needed to have returned the TV to the 
seller. But there was no need for Mrs A to have done this because she didnt accept or 
receive the TV because it was in a damaged state at the point of collection. And it makes 
sense to me that Mrs A would not have accepted a damaged TV and would have sought a 
reimbursement of the money shed given to the seller for that TV.
As such, it seems unfair to me that PayPal would decline Mrs As claim for a reimbursement 
under their Buyer Protection Scheme, seemingly on the basis of a loophole. And this is 
because I feel that the actual circumstances of Mrs As claim  that a seller has refused to 
reimburse her for a damaged item which she didnt accept from the seller because it was 
damaged  is clearly the type of scenario that PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme purports to 
protect its account holders from.
Finally, PayPal havent provided any additional reason for declining Mrs As claim beyond 
their taking the position that Mrs A going in person to collect the item and not scanning the 
QR code means that she isnt eligible for reimbursement under their scheme.
All of which means that Ill be upholding this complaint and instructing PayPal to reimburse 
Mrs A the £680 that she paid the seller for the TV she didnt receive. PayPal must make this 
reimbursement to Mrs A within 30 days of being informed that Mrs A has accepted this final 
decision, should she choose to do so.
Additionally, its clear that PayPals actions here have cause Mrs A an amount of trouble and 
upset that, by any reasonable standard, she shouldnt have had to incur. Because of this, my 
instructions to PayPal also include that they must make a further payment of £50 to Mrs A, 
as compensation for the worry and inconvenience they have caused.
Putting things right
PayPal must reimburse £680 to Mrs A within 30 days of being informed that Mrs A has 
accepted this final decision, should she choose to do so.
PayPal must also make a further payment of £50 to Mrs A.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above,
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2023.
