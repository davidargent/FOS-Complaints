K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains HSBC Bank Plc (HSBC) gave him incorrect information when he called 
them.
background
Mr B says when he called HSBC on 23 July 2018  at 13.00 and 16.00 and on 24 July 20181 
at 14.15 he was given incorrect information. He says HSBC told him they have insurance 
and if he paid £25 they would give him back 50000 USD which  had been transferred out of 
his account. Mr B quoted payment references  QMS 180522-00460 and RUK 180424-
000235 
HSBC werent able to send us a copy of their formal final response to Mr Bs complaint  as it 
hadnt been scanned onto their file. They told us it was sent to Mr B on 3 August 2018. They 
told us they didnt uphold the complaint  in relation to insurance. But HSBC  accepted  their 
overall customer service couldve been better and told us theyd credited £50 to Mr Bs 
account to compensate for this.
Our investigator listened to the calls HSBC provided  from 23 and 24 July 2018 but found no 
evidence Mr B was told about  insurance.  She went onto explain that she couldnt see how 
Mr B could claim even if HSBC had insurance. She thought HSBCs  actions  in paying £50 
for giving Mr B conflicting information when he called was fair. The investigator also later 
considered a further call between  Mr B and the complaints team  and found that contained no 
mention of insurance. She also investigated  if Mr B had been  charged the £25 fee for the 
recall of funds discussed and established  no refund was due as the charge  wasnt applied  to 
Mr Bs account.
Mr B disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to make a decision.  On 29 November 2018  Mr 
B attended our offices and with video  recordings he asked  the staff to view. He was asked to 
send the videos to the service so they were available to the ombudsman for review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the view 
that this isnt a complaint which I can properly uphold. Ill explain why.
In this complaint  relates only to Mr Bs assertion  that during calls on 23 and 24 July 2018 
HSBC told him they had insurance and if he paid £25 they would give you back $50,000. Mr 
Bs concerns about the transfer of the 5000  USD on 21 April have been dealt with separately 
and I wont be commenting on that here as its been the subject of a final decision.
The investigator has given a full summary of the background to this complaint in her letter  
giving Mr B her opinion. I think shes covered most points  quite clearly  and theres  not a 
great deal I can add to what shes already told Mr B.
Ive listened to all three  calls provided by the bank  and I find no evidence  of mention of any 
insurance. But I do think overall the information  across the calls was confused  Ill give 
some examples. In the third call Mr B was told that to recall the payment would cost £25. Im 
not sure why he was told this as the payment had already  been  returned some months ago. 
And in the earlier calls the operative  seemed to think the money was still with the recipients

for Mr B. But I think HSBC recognised this when they responded to his complaint. And I think 
their credit of £50 to his account is a reasonable response for this mistake.  So I dont require 
HSBC to do anything  further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2019.
