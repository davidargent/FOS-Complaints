The complaint
Ms S says PDL Finance Limited  trading as PDL (PDL) - irresponsibly lent to 
her.                           
Background
This complaint is about eight short-term loans PDL provided to Ms S between April 2014 and 
January 2015. Ms Ss borrowing history is as follows:

Before this services involvement, PDL agreed to uphold Ms Ss complaint about loans 6, 7 
and 8 and made an offer in line with our approach. Ms S wasnt happy with this offer so 
brought her complaint to us.  
Our adjudicator upheld Ms Ss complaint and thought the loans from loans 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the repayment was a significant amount of Ms Ss 
income and the overall pattern of the borrowing suggested that Ms S wasnt managing her 
money. PDL disagreed but offered to uphold loans 7 and 8. The offer was put to Ms S, but 
she again declined it and the complaint was passed to me to issue a final decision.
 
My findingsIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
PDL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that PDL should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that PDL was required to establish 
whether Ms S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Ss complaint. Having done this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Ms Ss complaint about loans 1 to 3. Ms S didnt respond to the 
adjudicators opinion. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making any further 
findings on them other than they formed part of Ms Ss overall borrowing. 
PDL has offered to refund all the interest and charges Ms S paid on loans 6, 7 and 8 as well 
as remove any adverse information about these loans from her credit file. I agree with this 
offer for loan 6 but I think there is more PDL needs to do in relation to loans 7 and 8. I will 
explain this in more detail later in my decision. I also think PDL shouldnt have lent to Ms S 
loans 4 and 5 either. Ill explain why. PDL says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Ms S and the results of these checks  
didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Ms S fourth loan in just over three months, I think 
PDL should have been looking to build a clear picture than it did about Ms Ss finances 
before lending her this loan.
I say this because Ms S was borrowing £550, which was due to be repaid in one payment 
plus interest. This meant that Ms S would be repaying around £715 from her monthly income 
of £1,350. The repayment represented a significant proportion of Ms Ss income and I think 
PDL ought to have realised this and the potential for Ms S to struggle to make the 
repayment. Given Ms Ss income and borrowing, it seems there was a significant chance of 
Ms S having to borrow again to meet her commitment under this loan. I think this was proven 
when  for loan 5 - she borrowed a larger amount on the same day she repaid loan 4. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of PDLs lending history with Ms S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which PDL should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so PDL should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
As I mentioned above, although PDL has agreed to uphold loans 7 and 8, I think it needed to 
go further with what it offered than it has done. I say this because I think that Ms S lost out 
because PDL continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans Ms S borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
Ms Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 8 and PDL should put things right.
Putting things right  what PDL needs to do
refund all interest and charges Ms S paid on 4 and 5  as well as loans 6 to 8 if it 
hasnt done so already;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 4 and 5 as well as loan 6 from Ms Ss 
credit file;
the number of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 and 8 should be removed from Ms Ss 
credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL to take off tax from this interest. PDL must give Ms 
S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
 
 
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Ms Ss complaint. PDL Finance Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
