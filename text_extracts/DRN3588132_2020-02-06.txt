K820x#14Complaint
Ms M is unhappy that NatWest UK Plc declined her mortgage application.
Background
In January 2019, Ms M applied for a mortgage  with NatWest via a broker.  After reviewing 
Ms Ms application, NatWest said it couldnt  offer her a mortgage.
Ms M says NatWest  initially approved her application. So, she wants  an explanation. She 
also wants NatWest to apologise and reinstate its mortgage offer.  
NatWest said it has to follow standards  and rules for all mortgage  lenders. It said its policies 
and procedures complied  with the lending  code. And said it hadnt made any error when 
assessing Ms Ms application  or when arriving at its decision  to decline the application. It 
said it had applied its lending criteria  correctly. And couldnt go ahead  with offering Ms M a 
mortgage. Ms M wasnt  happy  with this response, so she brought  her complaint to our 
service.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said Ms Ms application passed its initial 
credit reference checks, which is why the application was initially approved.  However, Ms M 
didnt meet NatWests  lending criteria. So, her application was declined. Ms M disagreed.  
She wants NatWest to reinstate its mortgage  offer. 
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
My findings  
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As a starting point,  no one is entitled to borrow money; even where a lender has lent before,  
its not obliged  to do so again.  But a lender must  treat customers fairly. In the context of an 
application for lending, that means assessing it fairly  in accordance  with the banks lending  
criteria.  And  like all lenders, NatWest was entitled  to set its own lending criteria, provided  it 
complied with various rules and guidance which lenders have  to follow.
Lenders criteria are commercially sensitive and not generally made public.  And, its not the 
role of an ombudsman  to interfere with a lenders commercial judgement  on how much  it will 
lend, and I see no reason  to depart  from that position here. 
Like all lenders, NatWest considers information  and evidence it receives  in respect of a 
mortgage application. It carries out its standard underwriting checks  to try to confirm the 
accuracy of what its told and to decide  whether it wants to lend.  A lender has to look at all 
the information about a consumer and decide  if its willing to grant  the mortgage by reference 
to its lending criteria.  And having completed  its checks NatWest decided  Ms M didnt meet 
its lending criteria. So, it wasnt willing to offer Ms M a mortgage.  Ive looked at the 
information NatWest  relied on to reach  its decision And having done so I find NatWests 
refusal was in line with its lending  policy. 
Ref: DRN35881322Its important to note that theres no obligation to lend  and theres no obligation  to give 
reasons for a refusal either. So, whilst I appreciate  Ms M would like this information,  I cant 
say NatWest has done anything wrong  by not providing an explanation  for its decision.
I appreciate Ms M feels NatWest treated her unfairly when it declined her mortgage 
application. But ultimately the decision it reached was one that broadly reflected its lending  
criteria.  Just because  NatWest wasnt willing to lend to Ms M doesnt mean NatWest was at 
fault because  it wasnt. 
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2020.
