The complaint
Mr H complains that the Police Mutual Assurance Society Limited (PMAS) did not make it 
clear to him what a Plan was or of the impact of making further ISA subscriptions on his 
ability to make partial withdrawals or transfers.
What happened
Mr H said this meant he was not able to transfer his first ISA subscription to another provider 
when it matured in 2019 as this would have constituted a partial transfer, something PMAS 
did not permit. It also mistakenly transferred his later May 2016 Fixed Term ISA subscription 
to a new provider before it matured. While it rectified this error and compensated Mr H, he 
feels the award should be increased given the stress and upset this caused.
He also says he lost £375 of interest on the £16,286 which could not be transferred and 
instead had to be used as 'new' ISA funds. He also wants £100 for the early transfer error.
An adjudicator at this service felt PMASs compensation had been fair and reasonable.
In summary she noted:
PMAS was entitled to make a business decision to only permit complete transfers of 
an ISA Plans holding to new providers
While Mr H could have made partial withdrawals, this wouldnt in practice have been 
possible given hed committed to a one-year fixed term ISA
She wasnt convinced that PMAS  in any of its documentation - had made clear that 
any additional ISA subscriptions would be made into the same Plan or the 
implications of this for transfers
It would be a key consideration for any customer who was thinking about taking more 
than one Fixed Term ISA subscription, over a number of tax years, to know this 
would stop their ability to transfer out any ISA subscription to another provider, until 
the final Fixed Term ISA matured
PMAS failed to explain the impact of subscribing to another Fixed Term ISA  either 
over the phone or in writing within the first 30 days of the May 2016 ISA being taken 
out i.e. that an additional Fixed Term ISA subscription would impact his transfer out 
options after his first February 2016 Fixed Term ISA subscription matured
Mr H said that had he known he wouldnt be able to transfer his February 2016 Fixed 
Term ISA subscription until his May 2016 subscription had matured, he would have 
ensured his finances were in such that he did not use all his 2018/19 ISA allowance 
so he could keep the 2015/16 ISA subscription funds, and their interest, tax-free
But he said even if fully aware of PMASs rules he would still have taken out the May 
2016 ISA and so wouldve had to withdraw, rather than transfer, his original ISA 
subscription maturity
He did not use all his 2018/19 ISA subscription so he experienced no financial loss 
when the money was withdrawn and used for a new ISA subscription with a different 
provider
PMASs compensation for the incorrect early surrender was fair: paying the full fixed 
interest hed lost, the lost interest with the new provider and £25
Mr H did not agree that PMASs offer was adequate, saying:
He estimated his loss at £375 (a years interest) as he was unable to utilise his full 
ISA allowance as this needed to be partially used to pay in the sum he was forced 
encash from his PMAS Plan
He had not said he would still have gone ahead with the May 2016 subscription even 
if hed been aware of PMASs rules; rather that he would have been able to decide 
what to do if fully informed
£25 is not adequate compensation for the amount of stress and worry caused by this 
issue and the ongoing impact on his overall health
PMASs documentation made it impossible to assess whether to go ahead with 
ongoing ISA subscriptions
In a provisional decision, I said:
PMAS is fully entitled to set its own rules regarding ISA transfers but the specific rule in this 
case clearly limits clients ability to act when a particular subscription - such as a fixed-term 
product - matures. Many other providers do not impose this significant limitation.
Given this, I believe it has a clear responsibility to signpost this issue in all its documentation 
and for its staff/advisors to point this out to clients such as Mr H. The fact that it mistakenly 
set up two Plans, which would've meant in theory that Mr H could have done what he 
wanted with the first maturing product, made things even muddier in this case.
Having read all the correspondence, I agree with many (but not all) of Mr H's concerns and 
do not believe £25 is close to being adequate compensation for the trouble and upset PMAS 
caused.  I've read and considered Mr H's argument about being unable to fully utilise his 
2018/19 ISA allowance and his clarification about what he might have done if aware of 
PMAS's rules at the outset.
While I don't share the adjudicator's view that he would definitely have gone ahead anyway 
and that he definitely did not suffer a loss (by having to reinvest the maturity sum using part 
of his 2018/19 allowance), neither do I think there is sufficient evidence to safely say that Mr 
H did suffer a £375 loss, as he claims.
Taking account of the evidence overall, I cannot be certain about either of these issues. 
However, I am satisfied that PMAS should pay Mr H significantly more than £25 in lieu both 
of his trouble and upset and potential loss.  
I currently intend to instruct the Police Mutual Assurance Society Limited to pay Mr H an 
additional £200 (over and above the lost interest and £25 it has already paid.
PMAS disagreed with my Provisional Decision and said:
Mr H issued the transfer instruction in relation to the second block of investment with 
a clear caveat not to action before his investment matured at the end of the fixed 
term
His primary lump sum was transferred early in errorOn Mr H raising the issue we transferred the additional growth component, on 
maturity to the new provider, and they confirmed this would be transferred with no 
impact to his ISA allowances
This means Mr H received the full transfer value of his ISA, albeit over two payments
As the delay in providing the second payment resulted in a notional loss of interest, 
we obtained the interest rate applicable from the new provider, and calculated the 
lost interest on the second investment component
This was reimbursed to Mr H directly
Based on the information provided to us by Mr H the impact was minimal and he was 
put back in the position he would have been had the error not occurred
He was also paid the standard compensation we pay for a basic processing error
Based on the information from Mr H there was no other impact indicated
There was no mention from Mr H of health issues or impact related to such issues at 
the time
As such we believe Mr H was put back into the position he would have been in had 
the error not occurred, and was compensated in line with our normal approach for 
processing errors
Whilst we recognise there was an ongoing issue in relation to the transfer of the 
original investment, this was a separate transfer request on the remaining holdings
We acknowledge that although the transfer was consequential to the original 
complaint, the error being addressed was a separate processing issue caused by 
human error and therefore not directly a result of the original issue. 
We would appreciate help in understanding the position of the impact, which we have 
not accounted for and warrants the compensation uplift
It then quoted from various sections of the literature Mr H had been provided with and/or 
advised to check, arguing that this made clear the nature of a Plan and the impact of ISA 
transfers before all the subscriptions had matured. It asked, in effect, what more it could 
have done to make things clearer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont dispute the timeline PMAS has provided, including what it did to put its one 
acknowledged error right. I also accept Mr H was not fully aware of the original double Plan 
problem and its implications till after raising his complaint.
However, I remain satisfied that it should pay Mr H an additional £200 in trouble and upset 
for the following reasons:
Mr Hs original complaint, and complaint to this service, centred on the fact that he 
could not transfer his maturing ISA subscription to another provider until the latter 
one had matured. He maintained that PMAS had failed to make this limitation clear 
when he took out either the first or second subscription. He argued that this had 
given rise to various losses and to significant trouble and upset
This is the complaint that I and the investigator assessed including our view of the 
likely impact of any errors by PMAS and the trouble and upset this might have 
caused Mr H
Given I believe PMAS did make various errors or omissions  though not several of 
those alleged by Mr H - I was entitled to consider what impact this may have had on 
Mr H and whether PMAS should pay additional compensationPMASs decision to place all of a clients ISA subscriptions into a single plan is a very 
significant limitation on an investors ability to decide what to do at the end of a fixed 
term
The Government-backed product is specifically designed to encourage yearly 
subscriptions, hence the annual tax-free allowance, year. A typical risk-free ISA 
investor, attracted to a fixed-term product, is likely to want the freedom to choose 
where to reinvest the proceeds at maturity, often in a new competitive fixed-term 
product.
In this context, PMAS single plan structure imposes a very severe restriction to many 
typical ISA investors
Given this, and the fact that many providers do not impose this restriction, I believe it 
is essential to spell this limitation out to a far greater degree than was the case in the 
literature Mr H was provided with. I dont agree that the Key Facts document did this 
sufficiently
It is not for me to say how this should have been done. However, to take the example 
of travel insurance policies, this service takes the view that where a particular policy 
has an unusual or surprising exclusion this must be clearly and prominently spelt out 
in the key sales documentation and, if necessary, made plain in any conversations 
with would-be purchasers. 
So I believe PMAS needed to provide Mr H with a very prominent and clear 
explanation of the implications of taking out additional ISA subscriptions in the 
original literature. To meet such requirements it would, in my view, need to 
prominently spell out that investors cannot transfer their money  at maturity  to 
another provider if they have since taken out any other ongoing fixed-term ISA 
subscriptions. I am not satisfied it did that
Nor, having listened to the key phone calls, do I believe its call handlers pointed to 
the limitations of the single plan structure  something which I think may well have 
affected Mr Hs decision to take out either or both of his ISA subscriptions
While the mistaken issue of two plans, or the apparent issue of two plans, was not 
the cause of Mr Hs complaint it nevertheless contributed to the problem latterly and 
added to Mr Hs overall stress and upset
PMASs letter of 12 February 2019 sets out Mr Hs options when his first ISA 
matured. It states that its Options ISA gives him the flexibility to use his proceeds via 
a range of options and specifically refers to transferring his ISA to another provider. 
This was clearly misleading if not incorrect as it did not allow Mr H to do so until all 
his other ISAs had matured
PMAS did not offer compensation in lieu of this serious error and, in my view, fully 
warrants a significant portion of my proposed £200
I recognise that both PMAS and Mr H have raised a large number of issues which I 
have not addressed here, particularly concerning the various phone calls
But, overall, I do not believe these significantly impact on the extent to which this 
complaint should be upheld or the degree of compensation. I share the investigators 
view that PMASs call handlers ought reasonably to have spelt out or spelt out more 
clearly the implications of taking out additional fixed-term ISA subscriptions and that 
the references to a single Plan were not sufficient to make Mr H aware of these
Putting things right
PMAS must pay Mr H an additional £200.
My final decision
I instruct Police Mutual Assurance Society Limited to pay Mr H an additional £200.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2020.
