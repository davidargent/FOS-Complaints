K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains about the way he was treated by Madison  CF UK Limited (trading as 118118 
Money) when he told them he was experiencing financial difficulties. 
background
In December 2016 Mr S entered into a Fixed Sum Loan Agreement  with 118118 Money. The 
amount of credit was £4,968.73 payable  over 24 months at £396.50  per month.  The total 
amount repayable was £9,516.00.
Initially Mr S made his monthly payments on time.  However in June 2017 Mr S became 
unemployed and his payments in October, November  and December 2018  were returned.
118118 Money made attempts to contact Mr S but these were unsuccessful. In January 
2018 Mr Ss account  was passed to recoveries.
The recoveries team attempted to agree a repayment  plan with Mr S. At the end of January 
2018 Mr S made a partial  payment of £350  but no repayment plan was agreed.
Mr Ss payments in February and March  2018  were returned.  In April 2018 the contractual  
monthly payment  of £396.50 was processed.
Mr S complained to 118118 Money.  He said hed already paid off the loan (excluding 
interest) and felt that the settlement figure quoted to him was incorrect.
In its final response 118118 Money  said the reduced settlement figure was offered based  on 
financial information provided by Mr S after he sought help from a money advice service.
Mr S wasnt  happy with the response and complained  to this service. He said he was in 
financial difficulties and that the payment processed  in April 2018 had left him unable to pay 
his rent.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. He said that 118118 Money had tried to agree a 
repayment plan with Mr S but Mr S hadnt entered into a conversation about this. The 
investigator also said that Mr Ss direct  debit was still active and was processed in April 
2018.
Mr S didnt agree. He said he couldnt  commit to a repayment plan whilst he was 
unemployed. He felt that 118118 Money had acted  unfairly in taking a payment from him in 
April 2018 because he had already  lodged  his complaint by that time.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When a consumer gets into financial difficulties a business should treat them in a positive 
and sympathetic way. I can see that Mr S advised 118118 Money about his financial 
difficulties. The business has responded by trying to agree  a repayment plan with Mr S. 
Based on the information Ive seen it doesnt look as if Mr S has been  willing  to discuss a 
repayment plan.  
Ref: DRN38790572I appreciate that Mr S is currently unemployed but just as 118118 Money has a responsibility  
to act positively  and sympathetically,  I would expect Mr S to take steps to try and agree a 
way to make  payments  going forwards, even if these are small amounts.
I can see that Mr S has asked 118118  Money  to waive  all of the interest  on the loan.  Theres 
no obligation  on a business to freeze or waive interest when a consumer is experiencing 
financial difficulties. In the circumstances Im satisfied  that 118118 Money has responded 
positively and sympathetically to Mr S and I think it has made reasonable efforts  to contact 
Mr S to try and reach agreement with him over a repayment plan.
Im aware that Mr S is unhappy that a payment was taken from his account in April 2018.  
118118 Money has explained that Mr Ss direct  debit  is still active.  So whilst Mr Ss direct 
debits payment had been returned  in previous months, it was processed in April 2018 
because his bank  allowed  it.
Because Mr S hasnt  agreed a repayment plan with 118118 Money hes still liable to pay the 
contractual monthly payment.  So Im unable to say that 118118 Money has done  anything 
wrong in taking the payment in April 2018.
Ive taken account of Mr Ss comments about  the payment being  taken  after he had lodged  
his complaint with the business and this service. Theres no reason  why Mr Ss obligation to 
make payments should end or be put on hold whilst his complaint is investigated, so I cant 
say that 118118 Money  has acted unfairly.
I understand that Mr S will be unhappy  with my decision. But having considered  all of the 
available information  Im unable to say that 118118 Money has acted unfairly and I wont  be 
asking it to do anything.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2019.
