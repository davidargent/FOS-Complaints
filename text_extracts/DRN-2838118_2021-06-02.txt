The complaint
 Mr G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal)unfairly charged him  foreign 
currency fees. He would like the fees refunded.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
Mr G incurred foreign currency conversion fees on the purchase and refund of items 
he bought via PayPal  because his debit card was linked to a foreign account. PayPal 
says Mr G hadnt updated the currency on the card so all transactions would default 
to the foreign currency. On this basis I believe PayPal was technically correct in 
applying the foreign currency charges that it did. 
However, I cant see any evidence that Mr G was ever told he had to contact PayPal 
to change the currency on his account. Ive seen a screenshot of Mr Gs PayPal 
account with shows the account as a GBP one. So I think Mr G could reasonably 
assume from this that any payments would be made in GBP particularly as he has 
told us he loaded his card with GBP. 
On this basis I think its fair for Mr G to get a refund of the charges he paid, and I 
agree with our investigators recommendation of £50 for the inconvenience.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold this complaint . In full and final settlement PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie,SCA should:-
Refund fees and charges applied to the purchase and refund of the two transactions 
in question with 8% simple interest from the date of payment to the date of settlement
Pay Mr G £50 compensation for the inconvenience
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2021.
