K820x#14complaint
Mrs M is unhappy  National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest)  placed a default notice against  
her name. 
background
Mrs M had an account with NatWest. She went to work abroad for a number of years.  But 
she made a few transactions so the account remained active. When she tried to use her 
online banking in July 2018 she discovered her account was overdrawn and NatWest had 
closed it. NatWest had also placed a default  on her credit file. Mrs M said shed asked 
NatWest to contact her by phone  and email. But it hadnt told her when  the account became  
overdrawn. So she wants the default removing and her account re-instating.
NatWest said the account  became overdrawn in December 2015.  Itd written to Mrs M on six 
occasions between  September 2017  and January 2018 warning  the account would become 
dormant and passed to its recoveries team if it remained in debt. NatWest said itd applied  
the charges correctly. And although  Mrs M had asked for correspondence by email it had to 
send letters when  an account was passed to recoveries. But as a gesture of goodwill it had 
credited the account with a refund of £252.21. Once the remaining  balance had been 
cleared the bank said it would update  Mrs Ms credit file. 
Mrs M wasnt satisfied  with NatWests response. So she contacted our service and our 
adjudicator looked into the matter. She could see the matter  had been very distressing for 
Mrs M. But she felt NatWest had acted fairly. The account wasnt  receiving any credits. And 
she felt NatWest had tried to contact  Mrs M. But banks  are obliged to send default notices by 
post. And Mrs M hadnt  received them  as her postal redirect had ended.  
Mrs M didnt  agree. She didnt think NatWest had made  reasonable efforts.  So itd acted 
unfairly towards her. And shes asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I can understand Mrs Ms frustration. She 
feels NatWest has breached its duty towards  her. So Ive looked carefully at everything 
Mrs M and NatWest have said.
When Mrs M moved abroad she asked NatWest  to communicate by email. And the bank 
updated its records. But payments in December  2015 caused  her account to become 
overdrawn. Over a period of time the interest and charges increased the overdraft. There 
hadnt been any recent activity. So NatWest decided to close  the account and pass  the debt 
to its recoveries department. 
Based on whatve I seen  I dont  think NatWest did anything wrong. The debt wouldve 
continued to grow if it hadnt  closed the account.  And I cant say NatWest  has breached the 
terms and conditions of the account  by writing to Mrs M despite her request for emails. The 
terms do say it will contact customers by post, email and phone. 
Its normal practise for banks to try and contact  customers by letter when accounts are 
passed for recovery. And its not the role of this service  to tell banks how to run their 
businesses. Our role is to see if NatWest  has made  any mistakes.
Ref: DRN41774702Mrs M said she wouldve paid the balance immediately if shed known. And I can understand 
her frustration. But she said she tried to access her account online in 2018.  And thats how 
she discovered a small overdraft had increased to over £200. But I cant  hold NatWest 
entirely to blame  for Mrs M not being  aware of the situation. Mrs M had a responsibility to 
manage her account and she couldve  checked  online during the time she was abroad.
Unfortunately the postal  redirect  had ended when NatWest wrote  to Mrs M during  2017  and 
2018. But although NatWest had correctly  followed  its procedures  I can appreciate why 
Mrs M is so upset.  The bank knew she was working abroad and had a note on its file to 
contact her by email. 
I can see NatWest has refunded charges totalling £252.21 as a gesture of goodwill. This 
leaves a small balance  for Mrs M to clear. And it means Mrs M hasnt been heavily penalised 
for what started out as a relatively small,  overlooked,  debit balance.  
NatWest does have  an obligation to report how Mrs M managed her account to the credit 
reference agencies.  And it was Mrs Ms responsibility to make sure the account remained 
within the agreed limits  even if she was working abroad.  She couldve used online or 
telephone banking to periodically check her balance and make  sure everything was okay.  
I realise Mrs M will be disappointed with this outcome. But I dont think NatWest  needs to do 
anything more. It has refunded the charges and interest that accumulated on the account 
while Mrs M was abroad. And NatWest said it will update Mr Ms credit  file to show  it is fully 
satisfied now the small  outstanding  amount has been paid. So I think  the banks response is 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2019.
