She was self-employed at the time of taking out the first loan. She then took up salaried 
employment in August 2018. She was offered a top up loan in February 2019 and took up 
the loan which she used in part to pay off the balance on loan 1. She got into difficulties with 
the repayments for loan 2 and made complaints about the difficulties caused to her in paying 
the loan.
118 118 Money said it assessed that Miss S was able to afford both loans, based on its 
credit search, the online application form, and its independent verification of Miss Ss 
income.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to consider whether 118 118 Money completed reasonable and proportionate checks 
to satisfy itself that Miss S would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way and/or 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences. Then taking that into account I have 
to consider whether in the circumstances 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision.
Miss Ss complaints about the administration of the loan and her difficulties with paying back 
the loan have already been dealt with as a separate complaint by this service. So whilst I 
understand that she is still concerned about the way she was treated and her difficulties with 
repaying loan 2, in this decision I can consider only the complaint about the decision to lend 
the monies for both loans. 
loan 1
118 118 Money carried out a credit check. That check showed Miss S to have a credit card 
with what was said to be a delinquent balance of £399 on it. But she had been making 
regular payments towards this. She had no other outstanding loans or credit card balances. 
Out of an income of £1,400 per month it was assessed that she needed to pay £14 towards 
her credit balances. I think the check was reasonable and proportionate and didnt in my 
view show the need to do further checks. I think it was reasonable to assess that she was 
able to afford the loan. I have noted Miss Ss bank statements but there is nothing I can see 
of any concern in them. I think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision.
loan 2
Miss S had paid regular payments towards the first loan. The credit check showed that she 
had continued to make regular payments towards her credit card balance, and hadnt been 
using the card. She had recently taken out a new credit card which had a small balance on it 
of £!20. She had a similar income and similar credit liabilities. So again I dont think the 
information would have alerted 118 118 Money to carry out further checks. I think 118 118 
Money made a fair lending decision in respect of this loan.
I appreciate that Miss Ss representative has done a more up to date credit check which 
shows Miss Ss financial position as being worse, but I dont think it would be reasonable to 
apply this to her position at the time of taking out the loans.
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 March 2022.
