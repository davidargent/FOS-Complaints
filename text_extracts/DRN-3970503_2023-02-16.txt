The complaint
Miss A is unhappy with the actions of National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) after she 
reported what she believed to be a duplicate payment from her account.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision in January 2023 to explain why I thought Miss As complaint 
should be partially upheld. And I said Id consider anything else anyone wanted to give me. 
This is an extract from that provisional decision:
On 16 September 2020, Miss A made a rent payment of £1,050 by debit card to her
propertys management company. However, on 22 September 2020, Miss A noticed that this
payment was due to be taken again. Miss A contacted her property management company
to discuss this, but they directed her to speak with her bank instead.
Miss A then raised the issue of the duplicate payment with NatWest. NatWest applied a
temporary credit to her account whilst it conducted an investigation into what had happened.
However, when NatWest issued its final response, it said it could only see one payment
leaving Miss As account and that was the payment on 22 September 2020. NatWest said it
appeared that it had taken five days for Miss As property management company to claim
the payment authorised on the 16 September 2020. And between the payment being
authorised and the funds being claimed, the funds had once again become available in Miss
As account and been withdrawn. As NatWest had identified no duplicate payment, it re-
debited the funds it had previously temporarily credited to Miss As account and this left Miss
A with an unarranged overdraft. Miss A says she received no prior notification from NatWest
that the amount would be re-debited.
Miss A said she lost her job during the Covid-19 pandemic and was now in receipt of
benefits which barely covered her everyday living expenses. So, she couldnt afford to repay
the debt. NatWest eventually passed it to a debt collection agency. NatWest also said it
planned to close all of Miss As accounts and gave her 60 days notice. Miss A asked for
these actions to be placed on hold whilst her complaint was investigated as she wanted to
use her accounts to maintain her existing direct debits. NatWest declined to wait for the
outcome of this complaint before taking any further action.
Miss A has also told us that whilst her complaint was being investigated, she spoke to
NatWest about a cashback payment of £69.60 which she needed access to in order to meet
her day to day living expenses. The cashback payment had been paid into the account with
the unarranged overdraft attached and so Miss A did not have access to it. Miss A has said
she was told during this conversation that this money would be paid into an account she
specified. This did not happen. Miss A said this resulted in her having to sell some of her
belongings to meet her living expenses. NatWest recognised that the payment wasnt made
as agreed and it offered Miss A £50 by way of an apology. This amount was also paid into
the account that was overdrawn so Miss A did not have access to it either. Regardless, Miss
A didnt think this was enough and said that when she contacted NatWest to discuss this,
she was treated poorly.
As an agreement was not reached, Miss A brought her complaint to this service and one of
our investigators looked into things. They didnt uphold the complaint. The Investigator said
she was satisfied that there had been no duplicate payment. She also said that Miss A had
been contacted about the unarranged overdraft debt on a number of occasions but had
failed to make any repayments. For this reason, she didnt think NatWest had done anything
wrong in passing the debt to a third-party debt collections agency. She pointed out that Miss
A had had the benefit of the funds that now made up the unarranged overdraft  it had been
used to pay her rent. And so she didnt think the overdraft charges applied to the account
had been applied unfairly.
Finally, the investigator said the £50.00 already offered to Miss A for not crediting the £69.60
to an account of her choice was fair. She said she had listened to a recording of the call that
took place between Miss A and NatWest but she didnt think NatWests advisor had behaved
unreasonably.
Miss A did not agree. She said:
she would not repay the outstanding debt until NatWest also took responsibility for 
some of it.
NatWest had reversed the temporary credit payment because it had not been able to 
read her email that supported her arguments that the rent payment had been taken 
twice  despite her sending this within the timeframe given. It had failed to notify her 
that her email was unreadable before taking this course of action.
NatWest had told her they would credit an account of her choosing with the cashback 
payment of £69.60. They hadnt and had lied to their customer.
It was unnecessary for NatWest to close all her accounts and this couldve left her 
without an account from which to pay her bills.
She had been treated poorly from the outset of her complaint and this warranted 
additional compensation.
As an agreement has not been reached, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im currently minded to reach a slightly different outcome to the one
reached by our investigator, in that I think the compensation offered to Miss A should be
slightly increased. Ill explain why in more detail below.
The duplicate payment
Having reviewed Miss As account statements for the period in question, I am satisfied there
was no duplicate rent payment. The payment Miss A authorised to her property
management company on 16 September 2020 was taken only once  on 22 September
2020. It appears that the five delay in collecting the payment has caused the confusion here.
Miss A authorised the payment on 16 September 2020 and at this point the payment was
showing as pending with the funds not being available to spend  so it couldve looked like
they had left the account. However, by 21 September 2020, the payment had still not been
claimed by Miss As property management company. At this point, the funds became
available in Miss As account again. Having reviewed Miss As account statements, I can see Miss A then withdrew the funds via 
a series of transactions within a 24-hour period. So, when Miss As property management 
company later claimed them, this took Miss A into an unarranged overdraft. Miss A says 
during one of the calls she has with NatWest that she may not have noticed at the time that 
the funds available in her account where actually the funds that shouldve been used to pay 
her rent and she had likely continued to spend as normal.
It is Miss As responsibility to ensure she has enough money in her account to cover her bill
payments. In this case, Miss A had withdrawn the funds she had initially intended to be used
to pay her rent when they bounced back into her account. This meant she didnt have
enough money in her account to cover the rent payment when it was eventually taken on 22
September 2020. This resulted in an unarranged overdraft being added to her account to
cover the cost.
The outstanding debt
In line with the terms and conditions of Miss As account, NatWest is entitled to apply interest
to an unarranged overdraft that its customer has had the benefit of. In this case, Miss As
unarranged overdraft has been used to meet her rent payment. She has therefore had the
benefit of the funds that make up this overdraft and this is now money Miss A owes the
bank. In line with the terms and conditions of Miss As account, NatWest are entitled to
charge interest and apply charges to any outstanding debt owed to them.
Having reviewed NatWests account notes, I can see that Miss A was contacted on at least
12 occasions about this debt before it was passed to the third-party debt collection agency.
Miss A had been contacted by telephone, email and letter but the debt remained unpaid.
Miss A has also told us that she does not intend to make payment towards the debt until
NatWest also accept some responsibility for it.
Miss A has been given the option to speak with NatWest about her finances and set up a
repayment plan that is affordable to her. But, based on what Ive seen, Miss A did not take
any steps to approach NatWest or repay the debt before it was passed on. When a customer
does not repay a debt which is owed, the bank is entitled to pass the debt to third-party debt
collection agency. And this is what has happened here. Given that Miss A has declined to
repay the debt or engage with NatWest about it, I dont think NatWest has acted
unreasonably in applying interest and charges to the account and passing it on to a third-
party and I wont be asking it to do anything more here.
Customer service
As part of its investigation into the duplicate payment, NatWest asked Miss A to provide
some additional information and it provided Miss A with a deadline within which to provide
this information. NatWest said that it would re-debit the temporary credit it had applied to
Miss As account if this information wasnt provided.
It is not in dispute that Miss A responded to NatWests request, by email, within the given
timeframe. However, for some reason, NatWest were unable to read the contents of the
email. But rather than contact Miss A to let her know and ask her to resend the email in a
legible format, NatWest re-debited the temporary credit from her account.
Whilst Im not persuaded this had an impact of the overall outcome of this complaint, Im
satisfied that the credit would have been removed eventually once it was identified that there
had been no duplicate payment, I am satisfied that Miss A was treated poorly here. And
having listened to the calls that take place between NatWest and Miss A later on and herwritten correspondence, its clear to me that this did cause Miss A some upset. Miss A has
thought throughout the complaint process that this was the reason her claim and been 
declined. Its clear that Miss A was struggling financially at the time and she felt NatWest 
werent interested in her complaint or listening to her. Im persuaded that NatWests actions 
in not contacting her about the problems with the email only compounded these feelings of
frustration for Miss A. Im not satisfied that the actions taken here by NatWest were good
enough.
I have also listened to a recording of the call where Miss A and NatWests advisor discuss
having the £69.60 cashback payment paid into an account of Miss As choosing. Miss A is
clear that she needs this money to pay her phone bill. She says she cant risk being cut-off
as she is currently looking for work. It is agreed with Miss A that this payment will be made
available in her savings account within two hours. Again, it is not in dispute that this does not
happen, and as part of my investigations, I asked NatWest what went wrong. NatWest hasnt
been able to identify what exactly went wrong but it acknowledged that something had. It
said it had paid Miss A £50 in compensation to say sorry for this error.
Im not persuaded that the £50 currently offered by NatWest is enough to compensate Miss
A for its error here. Miss A makes it clear during the conversation with NatWest that her
financial situation is very difficult, and she is relying on this money to pay her phone bill.
When NatWest dont do what they say theyre going to do, Miss A then has to resort to
selling some of her belongings. I can also hear in the call recordings how distressed Miss A
is about not having access to this money. And so, I dont think the £50 offered here is
enough to compensate Miss A for the upset and distress caused. Im also not satisfied that
paying the compensation offered into the overdrawn account was the right thing to do here
either. Miss As complaint was based around the account in question being overdrawn and
not having access to her cashback payment. NatWest also paying any compensation due to
Miss A into this account continued to compound this issue and appeared to show a
considerable lack of interest on NatWests behalf to Miss As vulnerable financial position.
For the reasons set out above, Im currently minded to conclude that NatWest should
increase its offer of compensation to £150 in order to fairly compensate Miss A for the errors
in its investigation and the upset they caused. When calculating this amount, NatWest
should take into account that Miss A has already received £50 and this has been used to
reduce her overall overdraft debt. But it should look to pay the additional amount directly to
Miss A.
Finally, Ive listened to the calls that took place between Miss A and NatWest and Im not
persuaded Miss A was treated poorly during any of them. There are a number of instances
during the calls where the conversations breakdown. Miss A is clearly upset about the
actions being taken on her account and with the answers she is being provided with. But this
doesnt mean that NatWests advisors were rude or that they acted unprofessionally in any
way.
Im also not persuaded that NatWest has acted unfairly in deciding to close Miss As
accounts. NatWest is entitled to close Miss As accounts, just as Miss A is entitled to close
her accounts with NatWest. But before NatWest closes an account, they must do so in a way
which is fair and complies with the terms and conditions of the account. The terms and
conditions of the account say that NatWest can close an account by giving 60 days notice.
NatWest have done this, so Im satisfied it has complied with this part. Ive then gone on to
consider whether NatWests reason for closure was fair and I think it was.
Miss A, at the time, had a significant outstanding debt that she had indicated she was
unwilling to pay. NatWest are entitled to set their own policies and part of that will form their
risk criteria. Its not in my remit to say what policies or risk appetite NatWest should have inplace and it appears they acted according to their risk appetite here and I dont think that
was unreasonable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im minded to reach the same overall conclusions I reached in my 
provisional decision. Ill explain why.
NatWest didnt respond to my provisional decision as it had nothing further to add. Miss A 
responded to say that whilst she maintained that NatWest should take some responsibility 
for some of the money owed, she would accept the compensation put forward as resolution 
of her complaint. 
As neither Miss A nor NatWest have provided any further submissions, I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank 
Plc. 
National Westminster Bank Plc should now pay Miss A additional compensation amounting 
to £100 to an account of her choosing. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 March 2023.
