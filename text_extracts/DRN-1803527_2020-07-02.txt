The complaint
Mrs H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc used compensation from mis-sold 
payment protection insurance (PPI) to reduce a debt it says Mrs H owes. Mrs H wants the 
compensation paid directly to her.
What happened
Mrs H complained about PPI she was sold with three loans. NatWest agreed the PPI on the 
loans was mis-sold and calculated compensation.
It sent Mrs H three letters offering compensation totalling £1,247.01. Mrs M signed and 
returned the acceptance forms.
But NatWest then contacted Mrs H and said that because she had previously been bankrupt 
it would use the compensation to reduce the outstanding debt she had with the bank.
Mrs H is unhappy with what NatWest has done. She said as the bankruptcy had ended the 
compensation should be paid to her and not used to reduce anything that wasnt cleared 
under the bankruptcy.
Our adjudicator said that NatWest could use the compensation to reduce the unpaid debt 
and didnt need to pay it to Mrs H. Mrs H wasnt happy with this and asked for an 
ombudsman to consider her case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Hs complaint and Ill explain why.
In 2005 Mrs H entered bankruptcy and she was discharged in 2006. This meant that all    
Mrs Hs debts were brought into the bankruptcy and any assets were used to pay something 
towards those debts if possible. NatWest has told us that its total claim in the bankruptcy 
was over £8,000.
When Mrs H was discharged from her bankruptcy it didnt mean her debt to NatWest no 
longer existed. It meant that NatWest couldnt ask or chase her to pay back the outstanding 
debt. But the debt still existed and remained over £8,000.
So, when NatWest calculated the PPI compensation it owed Mrs H it meant that both parties 
owed each other an amount. Mrs H owed NatWest a larger amount, so I think its fair that 
NatWest can use the amount it owes her to reduce her debt with NatWest.
Mrs H has told us she has had other PPI claims with other businesses paid directly to her. 
But I think that is a matter for individual businesses to decide and in this case I dont think it 
would be fair for me to direct NatWest to pay compensation to Mrs H when she owes 
NatWest a larger amount.Ive also thought about whether NatWest should have told Mrs H at the point it made the 
offers how it intended to use the compensation.
I agree it would have been useful if NatWest had mentioned in the offer letters that it would 
be using the compensation to reduce the outstanding debt. But I do note the letters all stated 
that:
If you are. or have been, subject to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), Protected 
Trust Deed, Bankruptcy or Sequestration, any payment we make will be made to the 
relevant account. Any disbursements due to you under the terms of the arrangement will 
then be managed by the Group's Insolvency Team.
And NatWest has also told us it sent three text messages to Mrs H on receipt of the 
acceptance forms restating the above. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Hs complaint. I think its fair for National 
Westminster Bank Plc to use the compensation from the mis-sold PPI to reduce Mrs Hs 
outstanding debt with the bank.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
