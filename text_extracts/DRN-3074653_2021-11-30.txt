DRN-3074653
The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain about the decision by ERGO Reiseversicherung AG (ERV) to turn 
down their travel insurance claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy covers cancellation in certain circumstances. The policy lists those 
circumstances, which includes redundancy. 
However, the policy doesnt cover cancellation because of a job offer. Although Mr 
and Mrs S think the cover is too limited, the cancellation cover provided is common 
for travel insurance policies. I havent seen a travel insurance policy that provides 
cover because an insured has received an offer of employment. 
I do sympathise with Mr and Mrs S. Mr S had been unemployed for several months 
and felt that if he didnt cancel the holiday, his offer of employment would be 
withdrawn. 
Nonetheless, Im satisfied that ERV acted fairly and in line with the policy terms when 
it turned down the claim.
For these reasons, although I understand Mr and Mrs Ss disappointment, I dont uphold this 
complaint.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S and Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 December 2021.
