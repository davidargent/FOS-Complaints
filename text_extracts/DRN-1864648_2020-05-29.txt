The complaint
Miss F has complained about loans granted to her by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). Miss F says that she could not afford to repay her 
loans and had to borrow again to meet her living costs the following month. She says Sunny 
should have realised from the number of times she borrowed from it that her debt problems 
were getting worse and that it wasnt responsible to keep lending to her. 
Miss F brought her complaint to this Service via a claims management company. For 
simplicity, I will refer to Miss F throughout this decision.
What happened
Sunny agreed 36 loans for Miss F from January 2018 to April 2019. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £50 to £500. The 
below table sets out some of the information Sunny has provided about these loans (with 
numbers rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran 
concurrently and all were repaid.

Our adjudicator upheld Miss Fs complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges she paid on loans 5 to 36.
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest and charges on 
loans 29 to 36  because, it said that it may have been prudent to have done things 
differently after we granted her twenty eighth  loan; due to Miss [F] being in a lending 
relationship with us for just over a year at this point and the amount borrowed increasing. 
Miss F didnt accept this offer and so the complaint came to me, as an ombudsman, to 
review and resolve. I issued a provisional decision on 14 April 2020 explaining why I was 
thinking of coming to a different view of Miss Fs complaint and provisionally found that it 
was irresponsible of Sunny to have agreed to lend to Miss F from her eighteenth loan 
onwards. 
Neither party has responded to my provisional findings so I will now issue my final decision 
on the matter. If Miss F accepts my decision, it will be legally binding on the parties.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Neither party has 
provided any comment, new information or arguments following my provisional decision, so I 
see no need to depart from my provisional conclusions. For completeness, I will set out my 
reasoning and conclusions again.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when Miss F took out her loans. 
The relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) said 
that for all loans Sunny needed to check that Miss F could afford to meet her repayments in 
a sustainable manner. This meant Miss F being able to meet her repayments out of her 
normal income without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether or not Miss F would be able to meet her repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny says it asked Miss F for information about her income and expenses  each time she 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Miss Fs monthly income as £1,200 when she first 
applied, which increased to £1,500 for her fifth loan onwards. It recorded her monthly 
expenses as ranging from £334 to £824. Sunny also said that it checked Miss Fs credit 
record through a third-party credit reference agency and took into consideration her existing 
credit commitments, though it hasnt provided the information it obtained. 
Miss F hasnt provided her credit file or any bank statements so I have limited information 
about her financial situation or how she was managing any existing credit commitments. 
Even if I found that Sunny ought to have carried out more comprehensive checks before 
lending to Miss F, I dont have enough information to determine what the lender might have 
found out about her circumstances and whether it would have declined to lend to her at any 
point. And looking at everything in the round, I havent seen any strong indications in the 
information I do have to suggest that Sunny should have declined to lend to Miss F in the 
months before July 2018.
Miss F took out 16 loans from January to June 2018. She usually had several running at any 
one time and was making repayments most months. Shed borrowed continuously, taking 
out her next loan the same day or within a few days of repaying her previous one. From the 
information Sunny provided it seems the largest amount shed been committed to repaying 
at any one time amounted to £600 in February and rose again to £450 in July (across loans 
12, 13 and 17 and 18). 
Sunny doesnt consider that taking out concurrent loans is a sign of financial difficulties. I 
agree that this alone might not suggest so, but the purpose of short term lending is intended 
to address a temporary shortfall in income. In this case, the emerging pattern of borrowing 
continuously and taking out further credit just after making repayments is suggestive of 
someone who has an ongoing need for credit not just a temporary shortfall in income. Sunny has also said that Miss F repaid all her loans, sometimes early. Successfully repaying loans 
however, doesnt necessarily equate to being able to repay them sustainably, in other words 
without having to borrow again or go without. 
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Miss F paid on loans 29 onwards because 
it said it recognised that the amount she needed to borrow was increasing and shed been 
borrowing for over a year at that point. I agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these 
loans but I also think Sunny should have stopped lending to Miss F before then, specifically 
when she asked for her 18th loan in July. Shed been continuously in debt to Sunny for 
about six months by then and I think at that point, if not before, the pattern of lending itself 
indicated that Miss F wasnt managing to repay her loans in a sustainable way. I think Sunny 
should have recognised this and declined to lend to her.
I think Miss F lost out when Sunny agreed loan 18 and went on to agree more loans for her  
because these loans unfairly prolonged her indebtedness and allowed her to take expensive 
credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. The number of loans and 
length of time she borrowed over was likely to be seen negatively by other lenders, 
potentially keeping her in the market for high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Miss F from and including her eighteenth loan taken out on the 14 July 2018. In order to put 
things right for her, Sunny should
refund all interest and charges Miss F paid on loans 18 to 36; and
pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
remove all information about these loans from Miss Fs credit file because any 
information recorded about them is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 My final decision
 As I've explained, I am upholding Miss F's complaint in part and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as Sunny to put things right as outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
