The complaint
Mr S says Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mr S bought the policy in 1997 at the same time as taking out a credit card through the post. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ss case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ss complaint because:
Mr S ticked a box on his credit card application form to indicate he wanted PPI. There 
was a box ti indicate if he didnt want it, but he didnt tick that box. So, I think Barclays 
made Mr S aware that he had a choice about buying the PPI, and that he chose to take 
it. 
Barclays didnt recommend the PPI to Mr S so it didnt have to check if it was right for 
him. 
Its possible the information Barclays gave Mr S about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr S doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy didnt cover  and based on what I know about his circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been useful to him. So, I dont think better information 
wouldve stopped him buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ss comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
