Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny.co.uk (ECI) irresponsibly 
lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 16 instalment loans which ECI provided to Mr S between  April 2015 
and July 2016. Mr Ss borrowing history  with ECI is as follows:

Mr S told us ECI had failed to see he had become dependent  on these loans and was 
borrowing other short-term loans to repay previous ones. He added  the lending history he 
had with ECI made it difficult  for him to achieve  a long-term solution to his financial issues. 
He said ECI had not carried out enough affordability assessments and that if it had, it would  
have declined to lend any more to Mr S.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. ECI disagreed with our adjudicators opinion about the complaint 
and asked for an Ombudsmans  decision. At a later time ECI said it would agree to uphold  
Mr Ss complaint from loan 15 onwards. This offer came in just before the file was passed to 
me to review  so it wasnt put to Mr S. But I dont think  its a fair way to resolve the complaint 
and so Ive issued my decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Having done that, I have  decided to partially  uphold  Mr Ss complaint  by saying loans 5 to 16 
should not have been made. 
Ref: DRN22704462ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Mr S could sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr S had with ECI, so 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
I went on to look at the remaining loans 5 to 16 which Mr S took out. As our adjudicator 
explained, a proportionate  check for loans 5 and 6 would most  likely have shown that Mr S 
was not managing his money because  he was having difficulty repaying his previous  ECI 
loans. A more proportionate  check would also have shown he had other  short-term  loans and 
was using online betting sites. So it seems reasonable to say that Mr S was unlikely to be 
able to sustain  repayments on these loans.  ECI should have seen this and not lent to him. 
Ref: DRN22704463Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Mr S, to see if there was a 
point at which ECI should reasonably have  seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 7. 
I say this because:
At this point ECI ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay the loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out 6 loans within around 5 months. So ECI ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ss indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £150  and loan 7 was for £200. At this point ECI ought  to have 
known that Mr S was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income but 
to meet an ongoing  need. 
From loan 7 onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within days or weeks  of 
settling a previous one. And he also, at times, had more than on loan running at the 
same time 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed ECI. Loan 16 was taken 
out 15 months after Mr Ss first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr S had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to ECI over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because  and I agree with Mr Ss submissions here:  - 
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to have 
had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 16 and ECI should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr S paid on loans 5 to 16 (inclusive) ;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  payment information about  loans 5 and 6 from Mr Ss credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  7 to 16 (inclusive)  should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires ECI to take off tax from this interest. ECI must give Mr S 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN22704464my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
