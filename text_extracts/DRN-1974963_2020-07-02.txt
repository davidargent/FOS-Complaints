The complaint
Mr S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited wouldnt send him his statutory 
credit report online. He said they would only send it to him by post because they said they 
were unable to verify him.
What happened
Mr S contacted TransUnion by email on 23 September 2019 explaining that he was having 
technical issues when he was trying to sign up online for his credit report. TransUnion 
explained they were unable to provide him with his credit report online at that time  but they 
said they could post Mr S his credit report to his home address. Mr S didnt want this to 
happen because he felt it wasnt secure  but online access was.
Unhappy with this, Mr S complained to TransUnion who explained that signing up for his 
online credit report wasnt automatically agreed. They said they have a robust verification 
procedure and their online service is subject to their verification and validation procedures. 
They said they are unable to give online credit report access to consumers if they cannot 
verify and validate their identity.
Mr S didnt accept what TransUnion had said so he brought the complaint to our service 
where it was looked at by one of our investigators. Our investigator didnt think that 
TransUnion had acted unreasonably. She said we wouldnt ask TransUnion to waive their 
verification process, so she was satisfied they hadnt done anything wrong.
During this period, Mr S managed to find out that TransUnion held an incorrect address for 
him, so he thought this was the reason why they were unable to verify him. He contacted 
TransUnion and amended the address and he was able to access his credit report online.
Mr S still remained unhappy because he wants answers as to why TransUnion held an 
incorrect address for him. He asked for the complaint to be looked at by an ombudsman, so 
it has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. While Im sorry to disappoint Mr S, I wont 
be upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
I appreciate it would have been frustrating for Mr S as he wanted to view his credit report 
online and he was unable to do so. I understand now that this has been rectified and he has 
the ability to use the online system for this.
TransUnion have their own verification and validation processes that they are entitled to 
adhere to. If they are unable to verify one of their consumers, they wouldnt allow online 
access for credit file reports  as they would need to be certain that the person viewing them 
was the actual person entitled to see them.Mr S says he found out himself that TransUnion held an incorrect address for him and once 
he updated the details with them, he was able to view his online credit report. Mr S wants to 
know why TransUnion held an incorrect address. He says that two other credit reference 
agencies have both got his correct address and he hasnt had any issues with them, so he 
doesnt understand why TransUnion had a different address. He believes they keyed it 
incorrectly.
Its clear that TransUnion couldnt verify Mr S which is why they wouldnt allow him to view 
his credit report online. Based on what happened afterwards, Mr S found out that 
TransUnion held an incorrect address for him which seems to be the cause of the issue. We 
made enquires to find out where TransUnion obtained their addresses from and they said 
they get addresses from a number of sources, but its not clear where the mistake came 
from. The important thing now is that this has now been fixed. I dont think based on this, 
TransUnion acted unreasonably when they said they wouldnt be able to allow Mr S to view 
his credit report online. They offered to send the credit report by post, and I think this was a 
reasonable compromise  but Mr S didnt want to receive it by post. In this situation, we 
wouldnt have expected TransUnion to do anything further because  they gave a solution to 
get Mr S access to his report.
I appreciate that Mr S would like an answer as to why TransUnion held an incorrect address 
for him, but its not always possible to find out why things have happened. Our role is to 
ensure that any outcome and resolution under the circumstances, is both fair and 
reasonable. 
As Ive already mentioned, I dont think that TransUnion have acted unfairly and 
unreasonably when trying to verify and validate Mr S before they allowed him online access 
to his credit report. They offered to send him a report in the post, and I think that was a 
reasonable step for them to have taken in the circumstances. While I appreciate this was 
frustrating for Mr S, this was minimal inconvenience to him so Im not asking TransUnion to 
make an award. And Mr S now has online access, so the problem has been solved.
I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr S, but Im satisfied that TransUnion have 
acted fairly in this situation.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30July2020.
