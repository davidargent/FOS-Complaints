The complaint
Mr K complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA placed a permanent limitation on his 
accounts and withheld his money for 180 days.
What happened
Mr K said he had two active PayPal accounts for a number of years. Mr K says that during 
the pandemic (summer 2020) he was abroad and needed access to money, so he 
transferred funds between his two PayPal accounts and withdrew the funds from his bank 
account. He says he did this again in September 2020 as he was in a similar situation. 
Mr K says that PayPal limited his accounts, one of which contained Â£1,900. He says he 
contacted PayPal about this, but they only gave him generic responses and permanently 
limited his accounts. Mr K says he was unable to access his funds for 180 days which 
caused him stress and he needed to borrow money to pay his rent.
PayPal did not uphold Mr Ks complaint. PayPal said that they had the right to limit access to 
any account reported to be involved in possible fraudulent or high risk behaviour. PayPal 
said they can use commercial judgement to decide what factors to consider when making 
that decision and they do not need to make these public because it would potentially open 
up routes for somebody to circumvent their system. 
PayPal later communicated with Mr K regarding his account holding a balance and said that 
in accordance with their user agreement, any funds in the account will be held for 180 days. 
After 180 days, they would contact Mr K with information on how to withdraw any funds in 
the PayPal account. PayPal later released the funds to Mr K.
Mr K brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator did not uphold his complaint. She 
said that PayPal decided to cease their relationship with Mr K as PayPal felt there was a 
potential risk associated with his accounts. Our investigator said that Mr K was aware 
PayPal would be holding his money for 180 days. And they have released the funds in 
accordance of the terms and conditions of the account. She said she was satisfied that 
PayPal followed their processes and the terms of their user agreement.
Mr K asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint. He said that PayPals systems 
should have picked up his duplicate account years ago and closed it. He said that he had 
transferred money between the accounts several times in the past and sometimes for large 
amounts. He also says that PayPal said his funds could be held up to 180 days, so they 
could have released his money earlier to him, especially as he needed the money to pay 
bills and he had explained this to them. Mr K said the only thing our investigator has really 
considered is PayPals user agreement rather than if they had measures in place.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr K has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive considered
and read everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and
informal body Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and
reasonable here.
Ive considered what Mr K has said about PayPals controls and the measures they have in 
place. I want to be clear to Mr K here that our service cant tell a business how their 
procedures should operate. But we would be able to look to see whether the business has 
followed their procedures in the actions theyve taken with Mr K and applied these fairly.
As Mr K has received his funds from PayPal, what I need to consider now is if PayPal made 
an error in how they applied the permanent limitation to his accounts or if they should have 
released his money to him earlier than the 180 days when he explained his financial 
difficulties to them. 
The first thing Ive looked at is whether PayPal were entitled to place a permanent limitation 
on Mr Ks accounts. Ive looked at the PayPal user agreement, which Mr K will have agreed 
to when he opened his accounts. The user agreement shows a list of restricted activities. 
And I can confirm that the reason Mr Ks accounts are permanently limited is listed in the 
restricted activities. So Im satisfied that PayPal were entitled to place a permanent limitation 
to his accounts. 
Ive considered what Mr K has said about PayPal not contacting him earlier regarding his 
duplicate account or him transferring money between the accounts. But their user agreement 
says, if we believe that you've engaged in any of these (restricted) activities, we may take a 
number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole 
discretion. So Im persuaded that this is clear that PayPal can decide when to take the 
actions if they decide that a restricted activity is carried out. Mr K is aware that our service 
cant disclose the reason why Mr Ks account is limited so I cant confirm his accounts are 
permanently limited because of the issues hes mentioned. 
I appreciate this will be very frustrating for Mr K but PayPals user agreement states we may 
be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to 
you about such decisions. We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk 
management or security procedures to you. So I dont think theyve been unfair to Mr K for 
limiting his accounts or not giving clear reasons for doing so.
Ive considered what Mr K has said about PayPal holding his money for 180 days. He says 
PayPals message says that they could hold his money for up to 180 days. So Ive thought 
about Mr Ks personal circumstances and what he says he told them in relation to paying his 
bills. And while this would have been a frustrating time for Mr K, I cant say that PayPal were 
unreasonable in not releasing his funds. I say this as they are clear in the message that they 
can hold it for up to 180 days. So Mr K willve been aware at the outset that he may not be 
able to access the funds for up to this period of time. And although Mr K may have been 
suffering financial difficulties at the time, Im not persuaded that it was unreasonable for them 
to do so based on the PayPal user agreement conditions which Mr K agreed to when 
opening his accounts.
PayPals user agreement also states that they may hold onto the funds (including, without 
limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal's rights arise from 
your engagement in the restricted activity). So Im not persuaded that PayPal were unfair to 
do so here where his account was limited based on a restricted activity being carried out.
I know that Mr K thinks the only thing which our investigator considered is the PayPal user 
agreement. And I have looked at his circumstances as a whole. But in order to uphold Mr Ks complaint I would need to see that PayPal acted outside of their user agreement. This is 
because Mr K agreed to the user agreement whether he read the full agreement or not. But 
for the reasons Ive already given Im satisfied that they have acted in line with their user 
agreement. So it follows that I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2021.
