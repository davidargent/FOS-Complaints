The complaint
Ms G and Mr H complain that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to them the money 
that theyve paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being represented in 
their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Ms G and Mr H had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in May 2011 and they 
entered into an acquisition agreement to upgrade their membership in June 2011 by buying 
some membership points. The purchase price of the points was £15,576 and they traded in 
their trial membership which was given a value of £5,995 so the balance due from them was 
£9,581. Ms G and Mr Hs made an advance payment of £500 and entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of £9,081. Ms G and Mr H agreed to 
make 144 monthly repayments of £129.42 to First Holiday Finance. 
Ms G and Mr H upgraded their membership again in July 2011 when they entered into 
another acquisition to buy some more membership points. The purchase price of those 
points was £14,082 and Ms G and Mr H made an advance payment of £500. They entered 
into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of £13,582 (which 
included consolidation of their June 2011 loan and the account for that loan was then closed) 
and agreed to make 144 monthly repayments of £193.58 to First Holiday Finance. 
Ms G and Mr Hs representative made claims to First Holiday Finance in May 2018 about the 
loans under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the points were mis-
sold and, but for the misrepresentations made, Ms G and Mr H wouldnt have purchased the 
points nor entered into the loan agreements. It said that the terms of the agreements were 
unfair as an undisclosed commission was paid and Ms G and Mr H were pressured into 
entering into the loan agreements. A statement from Mr H was provided. 
First Holiday Finance responded to those claims and set out why it considered that they 
shouldnt be upheld and it provided a response from the holiday company. Ms G and Mr H 
werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Their complaint 
form says that: First Holiday Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their 
ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; and the membership was 
misrepresented. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Ms G and Mr Hs complaint should be upheld. She 
said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Ms G and Mr H 
and First Holiday Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
Ms G and Mr Hs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in 
detail and sets out further reasons that it considers that there was an unfair relationship. It 
has also described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Ms G and 
Mr H. Our investigator then said that she hadnt seen anything to persuade her that the 
lending was unaffordable at the time of the loans and she explained why she didnt consider 
that First Holiday Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission that it 
paid to the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms G and Mr Hs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Ms G and Mr Hs complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claim that 
theyd made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to this service within 
six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 
applies to their claim;
Ms G and Mr Hs claim was made under section 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not First Holiday Finances response to that claim was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances;
I consider it to be clear from Ms G and Mr Hs representatives letter to First Holiday 
Finance in May 2018 and the complaint form that was sent to this service that the 
claim was made under section 140A and that no claim was made under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act so I havent considered any complaint about First Holiday 
Finances response to a claim under section 75;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
First Holiday Finance says that the June 2011 loan was fully consolidated in the July 
2011 loan and that the account for the June 2011 has closed  it said in June 2022 
that Ms G and Mr H had been maintaining repayments on the July 2011 loan and 
hadnt contacted it to suggest any form of inability to continue with repayments  as 
that loan hasnt ended I dont consider that Ms G and Mr Hs section 140A claim 
about the loans is time-barred;
Ms G and Mr Hs representative described in the letter that it sent to First Holiday 
Finance in May 2018 the ways that it says that the membership points were mis-sold 
to Ms G and Mr H and the ways that they were misrepresented to them;
Mr H provided a witness statement in which he describes what he says happened  
he says that they were advised that they were only points away from getting the gold 
standard membership and could get half price holidays or holidays for two weeks for the price of one week, or would get priority bookings and that the more points they 
had, the more holidays they could have, the better availability that they could have, 
and the flexibility of the worldwide resorts  but hes described the issues that theyve 
experienced including struggling with availability, the resorts arent exclusive and can 
be enjoyed by other who dont have to pay the maintenance fees and the standard of 
accommodation that theyve used isnt as good as the accommodation that they used 
for their trial;
Ms G and Mr Hs complaint form says that: First Holiday Finance paid a commission 
to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured 
them into entering the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them; and the membership was misrepresented;
Ms G and Mr H bought a trial membership in May 2011, they upgraded their 
membership in June 2011 when they bought some membership points and they 
bought more membership points in July 2011;
Ms G and Mr H signed acquisition agreements (which included the terms and 
conditions) and a membership declaration in June and July 2011 and First Holiday 
Finance says that theyve used their membership points to purchase 16 holidays;
Ive carefully considered what Mr H has said in his statement and the other 
information that Ms G and Mr Hs representative has provided (including its detailed 
response to our investigators recommendations) but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the membership points were misrepresented to Ms G 
and Mr H by the holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the 
acquisition agreements by any misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that the terms of the acquisition agreements are unfair or that the 
membership points were mis-sold to Ms G and Mr H;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms G and Mr H complained to the holiday 
company or First Holiday Finance about any of those issues until May 2018  nearly 
seven years after they entered into the acquisition agreements and if they considered 
that the membership points had been misrepresented or mis-sold to them, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance before then;
Ms G and Mr Hs representative says that First Holiday Finance paid an undisclosed 
commission to the holiday company  but First Holiday Finance says that no 
commission was paid and it doesnt pay any commission to the holiday company and 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that it did pay a commission to the 
holiday company;
Ms G and Mr Hs representative says the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Ms G and Mr Hs ability to afford the loan but First Holiday Finance 
says that it carried out standard underwriting procedures based on the information 
supplied by Ms G and Mr H to ensure that the loans were affordable for them and it 
was satisfied that they were able to afford the monthly repayments;
it also says that Ms G and Mr H completed a compliance confirmation in which they 
confirmed that theyd received the pre-contract credit information form and that they 
were given adequate time to consider it;
First Holiday Finance says Ms G and Mr H have never contacted it to suggest that 
they may have any difficulty in maintaining the monthly repayments and the conduct 
of their account never suggested that they were at any time struggling to meet the 
repayments;Ive not been provided with evidence showing the affordability assessments that were 
made but Ive seen no evidence to show that the loans werent affordable for Ms G 
and Mr H when they were made to them in June and July 2011;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms G and Mr H asked First Holiday Finance for 
any information about its affordability assessment before May 2018  as the loans 
were made to them in June and July 2011, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have raised any concerns about the affordability of the loans before 
then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Ms G and Mr H were 
unduly pressured into buying the membership points or entering into the loan 
agreements or that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices 
against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms G and Mr H complained to 
First Holiday Finance about those issues until May 2018 (nearly seven years after the 
loans had been made to them) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have complained to First Holiday Finance about any such issues before then;
Ms G and Mr Hs representatives response to our investigators recommendations 
includes claims about the unfairness of the management charges and other claims 
which werent included in the claim that was made to First Holiday Finance in May 
2018 or in the complaint form that was provided to this service  as those claims 
havent been made to First Holiday Finance Im unable to make any finding about 
them in this decision;
Im not persuaded that Ms G and Mr H have provided enough evidence to show that 
their relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Ms G 
and Mr H and First Holiday Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for First Holiday Finance not to uphold 
Ms G and Mr Hs claim under section 140A; and
I sympathise with Ms G and Mr H for the issues that theyve have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require First Holiday Finance to refund to them any of the money that 
theyve paid under the loan agreements, to pay them any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms G and Mr Hs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
