K820x#14complaint
D, a limited company,  complains that Barclays Bank Plc (trading as Barclaycard) did not 
provide a refund of charges in the way it said it would.
background
D has a merchant account with Barclaycard. In November 2018 it complained about the 
charges. These had increased and included  a non compliance charge. Barclaycard said that 
it would  refund the total charges from May to October 2018 of £288.10. However, it only paid 
£158.58 to Ds bank account  having  netted outstanding charges on the merchant account of 
£129.52. 
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint be upheld. He said that the final 
response letter had said that £288.10  would be paid to the bank account. Barclaycard could 
have been clearer  about how the money would be applied. But he did not think  it had acted 
unreasonably.
D did not agree and said that Barclaycard had not done what it said it would and that we 
hadnt followed our own rules in dealing with this complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service provides informal dispute  resolution  and we look at the circumstances  of any 
complaint afresh.  We dont have to follow here what Barclaycard offered as a resolution. And 
I cant see that weve not acted in line with our rules contained in the Dispute Resolution 
Handbook established by the Financial Conduct Authority. As D did not agree with our 
investigators view the complaint has been passed  to me for a final decision.
Ive looked at the merchant statements for D. The charges  due from May to October 2018 
totalled £288.10 and this included the October 2018  charge  itself of £64.76. I havent seen 
any evidence to show that these charges were not due under  the agreement  between D and 
Barclaycard. 
When D complained  Barclaycard  noted  that it had not been using the service and as a 
gesture of goodwill said it would refund some charges.  It said in the final response letter  
dated 23 November  2018 that a credit  of £288.10  has been applied  to your bank account 
for the period of May 2018 to October 2018.
What I believe it had expected when making  that statement is that the charges for October 
and November 2018 would be paid by D. The charge  for November  2018  was a further 
£64.72. And D had not paid the cumulative amount owing  shown in the November 2018 
statement of £129.52.  The refund  of £288.10 was applied to the merchant account and the 
net figure of £158.58 paid to Ds bank  account on 4 December 2018.
Given that the refund from Barclaycard was to cover  charges paid including  October  2018  I 
see no issue at all with the outstanding  charge for the month of October 2018 being  netted. 
And there was no basis for a refund of the November 2018  charge based on what  had been 
agreed. Barclaycard took the view that this was fairly due anyway.
Ref: DRN87302832I understand why D was unhappy with this approach. But Im not in a position fairly to ask 
Barclaycard to do anything else. This refund was as I say a gesture of goodwill and 
Barclaycard could expect  D to keep the account up to date after that. 
I dont have a reasonable  basis to require Barclaycard to do anything further.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
