K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  gave him incorrect advice 
when he asked for certain transactions to be cancelled and this wasnt  done.
To settle  matters hed like NatWest  to refund the amounts it debited from his account.
background
Mr P is a sole trader and has a business account  with NatWest. He used  his debit card to 
pay for a hotel overseas. He had a no show notice from the hotel for a booking that had been 
cancelled previously. He contacted the hotel and asked it not to take funds from his account 
and he also contacted NatWest on 1 February  2019 in the afternoon  and asked it to stop the 
payments to the hotelier.  He says NatWest agreed  to this.
However, a few days later Mr P found  out that four payments  of Â£277.94 were debited from 
his account and paid to the hotelier. Mr P complained to NatWest  about this.
NatWest said it had no reason to disbelieve that Mr P had incorrectly been told his payments 
could be stopped so it sent a luxury hamper  by way of apology. But it didnt agree to refund 
the money debited  because  it needed supporting evidence from Mr P to show the hotel 
booking had been cancelled.
Mr P says that if NatWest  had correctly told him the payments couldnt be stopped  he would 
have had options  like removing the money from his account  to stop the direct  debits being 
taken. He also says he should be able to control  transactions from his account.
Unhappy with NatWests  response,  Mr P brought his complaint to this service. One of our 
investigators looked into his complaint but didnt recommend that it should be upheld.
The investigator said that even if Mr P had been given the correct  information NatWest 
couldnt have  stopped  the payments from debiting his account  as they were already being 
processed when  Mr P contacted NatWest. So he didnt think  it would be fair to ask NatWest 
to refund the payments.
And if Mr P had removed  all the money from his account, this wouldnt have stopped  the 
payments going  through either and would have  resulted in his account becoming  overdrawn.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I broadly agree with what 
the investigator has already said.
NatWest hasnt been able to locate  the call Mr P made on 1 February 2019. But it accepts 
Mr P was incorrectly  told the transactions with the hotelier could be stopped when they 
couldnt. Its understandable that Mr P was upset to find that the transactions hed asked  to 
be stopped were later debited from his account. So I need  to look at the impact this has had 
on Mr P.
NatWest has provided information  to show  that the four transactions to the hotelier were 
processed early in the morning on 1 February 2019.  By the time Mr P contacted NatWest in 
the afternoon  to ask for the transactions to be stopped, the payments were already being 
Ref: DRN98952962processed. In these  circumstances  Im satisfied there was nothing  NatWest could do to stop 
the payments.  So I cant fairly ask it to refund these  payments to Mr P.
And even  if Mr P had been given the correct information - as Ive explained above - there 
was nothing NatWest  could have done to stop the transactions debiting  his account  because 
they were already being processed.
Mr P says that had he known the transactions couldnt be stopped he would have removed 
the money in his account to stop the payments being taken. But Im satisfied that if Mr P had 
done this, the payments would still have  debited as they were already being processed   so 
this would have  resulted  in his account  becoming  overdrawn.
I can also see that NatWest provided information to Mr P about  how he could  dispute  the 
transactions by way of chargeback. And I can see the Retail  Disputes Team asked Mr P to 
provide evidence to show  the hotel booking had been cancelled. Ive looked  at NatWests 
customer contact notes  and theres nothing to suggest Mr P provided the information 
requested. So I cant  find NatWest acted unfairly when it didnt raise a chargeback.
As the investigator  has explained strict timescales apply to chargebacks and unfortunately 
Mr P is now out of time to ask NatWest  to do this.
And even  if NatWest had raised a chargeback for Mr P theres no guarantee it would have  
been successful.  Thats because chargebacks can be defended by the merchant in line with 
the card scheme  rules. I think its more likely than not that the transaction would have  been  
defended by the merchant  as Mr P hasnt  been  able to provide a copy of the email he sent to 
the hotelier to ask for the booking to be cancelled.
In the circumstances Im satisfied that the incorrect information given by NatWest  didnt  have 
any substantial impact  on Mr P so Im satisfied the hamper provided by NatWest is sufficient 
to recognise the upset  caused.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 September  2019 .
