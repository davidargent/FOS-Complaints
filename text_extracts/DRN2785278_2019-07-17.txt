K821x#15complaint
Mr K complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) gave him loans  that he 
couldnt afford to repay. Mr K is represented  by a claims  management company. It asks that 
Quick Quid writes off any balance and pays  compensation for the upset caused to Mr K, with 
8% interest.
background
Mr K took out 13 short term loans,  plus a number of top ups, and one flex credit loan with 
Quick Quid between December 2012  and July 2016. He says he couldnt  afford  the loans 
and Quick Quid would have known this if it had made proper checks. Mr K says the cost of 
his debts increased to a level where  he couldnt meet his living expenses.  
Our adjudicator recommended  that part of the complaint should be upheld. She said Quick  
Quid wasnt wrong to offer loans 1 to 3 to Mr K. But it shouldnt  have offered loan 4 (the flex 
credit loan). By this time Mr Ks pattern of borrowing suggested hed become reliant on short 
term loans. 
There was a break of about a year between  Mr K repaying loan 4 and taking out loan 5. The 
adjudicator said given the break in borrowing, it wasnt  wrong for Quick  Quid to offer loans 5 
to 10. But it shouldnt have offered the top up of loan 10 in January 2015. The repayment 
was a significant proportion of Mr Ks income  and there was a substantial risk he wouldnt be 
able to repay it. And by the time Mr K took out loan 11 his pattern of borrowing suggested 
hed become reliant on short term loans.
The adjudicator said Quick Quid shouldnt have offered loan 4, the top up to loan 10 or the 
later loans. 
Quick Quid didnt agree. It said its checks were  proportionate and there was nothing  to 
suggest Mr K would have  difficulty  repaying  the loans. It said the flex credit loan (loan 4) was 
repaid in instalments over 10 months. And some  loans, including  loan 10, were repaid over 
three periods, giving Mr K time to accumulate  income for the larger, final repayment.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Mr Ks income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.

Loan 14  top up 05.07.2016 £100 £499 15.12.2016
Loans 1 to 3 (December 2012  to May 2013)
When Mr K took out loans  1 to 3 he told Quick  Quid his monthly income  was £1,150.  Quick  
Quid hasnt recorded  what, if anything, it knew about Mr Ks outgoings.  It says it did credit  
checks and this didnt  suggest any problems. 
While I think Quick Quid might have done more thorough checks before  agreeing  these 
loans, I dont think, given the amount of the loans,  Mr Ks stated income and that this was 
the start of the lending relationship, proportionate checks would have given it any reason to 
think the loans  werent  affordable or that further checks were needed.
Loan 4  flex credit  loan (August 2013  to June 2014)
I think when Mr K asked for loan 4 Quick Quid should have realised  further lending  was 
unsustainable. While this was a flex credit agreement with repayments over 10 months, 
Quick Quid still needed to ensure Mr K could repay it sustainably.
Ref: DRN27852783The loans offered by Quick Quid  were  intended for short term use. But by the time Mr K took 
out the flex credit loan hed been borrowing  from Quick Quid for about  eight  months. Loans 1 
to 3 were repayable the month after they were  taken out and all three were deferred  at least 
once. This could suggest Mr K was having  difficulty managing his money. There  were  no 
breaks between Mr Ks loans of more than about  a week.  Quick Quid  ought  to have realised 
Mr K was having to borrow  to cover the gap in his finances left by repaying  his previous loan. 
Having looked  at Mr Ks flex credit account,  I can see that hed drawn down the full credit 
limit (£750) by 23 August  2013. Quick Quid says the flex credit  agreement allowed Mr K to 
repay what hed borrowed  over 10 months  and the maximum  monthly repayment was £242. 
But Quick  Quid sent emails to Mr K asking him to pay more than this. Quick  Quid sent an 
email to Mr K saying £676 was due on 27 August 2013  and Mr K made a £676  payment on 
that date.
Mr K increased his borrowing again  in September 2013 and had again drawn down  the full 
credit amount by early November. He incurred late fees in December 2013 and January 
2014. He reduced  the amount owed in early 2014  but by early May 2013 hed drawn down 
£676 and by early  June  hed drawn  down the full credit amount. Quick Quid  sent an email 
asking for repayment  of £943 on 1 July 2014.
I think Quick Quid should have known from Mr Ks previous borrowing pattern that this 
lending was unsustainable. And I think the way Mr K used the facility supports this.
Loans 5 to 10 (June 2015 to January 2016)
There was a break of about a year between  Mr K repaying loan 4 and taking out loan 5. Mr K 
told Quick Quid his monthly income was £1,300 and his outgoings (which  included housing, 
utilities, food, transport  and credit commitments) were £525. Quick  Quid  says it did credit  
checks and this didnt  suggest any problems. 
Given the amount  of the loans, Mr Ks stated income  and expenditure and the break since 
his last loan was repaid, I dont think Quick Quid had any reason to think  the loans werent 
affordable. 
I think Quick Quid might have done more  thorough  checks  before agreeing these loans, 
particularly those requiring larger repayments.  But, given the amount of the loans, Mr Ks 
stated income and expenditure and the break  since his last loan was repaid, I think  its 
unlikely proportionate checks would have given it any reason to think  the loans werent 
affordable or that further checks were  needed.
Loan 10  top up (January 2016)
I think when Mr K asked for the top up to loan 10 Quick Quid  should have realised further 
lending was unsustainable. The amount of the last repayment due  £624  was a significant 
proportion of Mr Ks income.  I think Quick  Quid should have known there  was a real risk that 
Mr K wouldnt be able to meet his existing commitments and the repayment  without 
borrowing again. 
Mr K had given the same  income and expenditure information  since  June 2015, when he 
applied for loan 5. This suggested he had about  £775 of income left each month after 
meeting his stated  expenditure.  Yet hed been taking out loans on a regular basis  for seven 
Ref: DRN27852784months  10 loans and top ups in total.  This suggests he was having difficulty  managing  his 
money. I dont think it was reasonable for Quick Quid to rely on the expenditure information  
Mr K had provided.
Quick Quid says loan 10 was repayable over three months with the largest repayment at the 
end. It says Mr K could use surplus income from the first two months  towards the loan 
repayment. I dont  think,  in the circumstances, this is reasonable. I think its unlikely Mr K 
would be taking out loans on a regular  basis if he was in a position to put money aside each 
month. 
Loans 11 to 14 (March  to July 2016)
The loans offered by Quick Quid  were  intended for short term use. But by the time Mr K took 
out loan 11 hed been borrowing from Quick  Quid for about  10 months without a significant 
break. Mr K didnt make any real inroads into the amount he owed Quick  Quid.  His last two 
loans (with  top ups) were for £550 and £400  significantly more  than the £150  loan Mr K 
had taken out in June  2015. In August 2016  Mr K told Quick Quid  he was in financial 
hardship and it agreed a repayment plan for the outstanding debt.  
In effect, Mr K paid large amounts of interest  to service a debt to Quick Quid  over an 
extended period.  I dont  think this borrowing was sustainable. I also think  this number of 
loans would have  had an adverse effect on Mr Ks ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high cost loans.
what should happen now?
I dont think Quick Quid should have given Mr K loan 4 (the flex credit  loan),  the top up to 
loan 10 or loans 11 to 14 (including the top ups). So it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loan 4 (the flex credit  loan),  the top up to 
loan 10 or loans 11 to 14 (including the top ups);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  about  the top up of loan 10 from Mr Ks credit  file; and
remove all entries about  loan 4 (the flex credit  loan) and loans 11 to 14 (including the top 
ups) from Mr Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order CashEuroNet  UK LLC to take the steps 
and pay the compensation set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
