The complaint
Mr L complains about a failed buyer dispute with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal).
Mr L also complains his account has been limited.
What happened
Mr L bought a pair of trainers through a third-party online retailer that he says were not as 
described. 
Mr L raised a buyer dispute with PayPal and was advised to send the trainers back to the 
retailer. Mr L says that after he posted the trainers, PayPal declined the claim. Mr L went on 
raise a further claim for a disputed transaction, but PayPal found Mr L did pay for the 
trainers, so this was also declined. So, Mr L raised a complaint with the business. 
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. PayPal said that Mr L had breached the 
terms of his account by raising multiple claims. PayPal went on to limit Mr Ls account which 
prevented him from using it again. As Mr L remained unhappy, he brought his complaint to 
our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt find it should be upheld. Our investigator 
found Mr L had been making multiple claims across different accounts. So, he agreed that it 
was within PayPals terms and conditions that it could decline the dispute and limit the 
account.
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators view and said he had only raised the one claim. So, 
the complaints been passed to me to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
Mr L has given our service two email addresses that he uses. PayPal have confirmed these 
email addresses have been used to set up multiple accounts and subsequently multiple 
claims. Ive also seen evidence of these accounts. Mr L hasnt said that his email address 
has been used without his permission, so I have no reason to doubt these are in fact 
accounts linked to and used by Mr L. 
PayPals user agreement allows it to limit an account and decline buyers disputes at its 
discretion. Our service can look at whether this was fair in the circumstances of the claim. 
But, having considered the information given to me by both parties, Im satisfied that that 
PayPal hasnt acted unfairly or against the terms of the account in the circumstances of Mr 
Ls complaint.
The term PayPal have relied on when its limited Mr Ls account is
Abuse of our online dispute resolution process and/or PayPals Buyer. Protection 
program and/or PayPals Seller Protection program.
Although PayPal have not agreed to our service sharing more detailed information regarding 
the limitation due to its confidentiality, Im satisfied with the reasons theyve given for not 
doing so. I hope Mr L can take some assurance in the fact Ive seen the information as part 
of my investigation though.  
I understand Mr L has given our service evidence that shows only one closed buyer dispute 
case. Ive looked into this information carefully, and having done so, found that this only 
shows the number of cases against one of Mr Ls email addresses. The rest of the claims 
are against the second address Mr L uses. 
In summary, Mr L has clearly used different email addresses to set up and claim across 
several accounts. This is in breach of PayPals terms and conditions and I dont think they 
have done anything wrong or acted unfairly when it has declined Mr Ls claim and limited his 
account.
As Mr L sent the item back to the retailer, my suggestion would be to contact them and ask 
for a refund or the item back. Im unsure why Mr L has gone down the route of using PayPal 
rather than just direct with the retailer under its returns policy.
Its my understanding that Mr L also has an outstanding chargeback request with his bank. I 
would also suggest chasing that up.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
