No details have been given to us by STFL about the first loan and it may not have been a 
loan, but it has led to STFL numbering the loans on one of the spreadsheets it sent to us as 
if that was the first loan. So, for example, the loan issued 12 November 2018 is listed as 
loan 12 in the spreadsheet from STFL. Our adjudicator referred to 26 loans in total when she 
wrote to STFL and it has not corrected it. So, I have retained the same loan table and the 
same numbering of the loans for continuity. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that for STFL to rely on the 
information Ms L had given to them for loans 1 to 3 was correct. From Loan 4 our adjudicator 
did think that additional checks ought to have been carried out but in the absence of 
adequate financial information from Ms L then she could not come to a conclusion on loans 
4 to 6. Our adjudicator felt that the nature of the relationship and the lending requests from 
Ms L was such that STFL ought to have ceased lending at loan 7. 
Ms Ls representative has acknowledged this outcome but has not said either way if Ms L 
agrees with it or not. It has sent no additional representations. 
STFL disagreed and said that it had complied with guidelines, regulations and its own 
policies. 
And in relation to loans 25 and 26 STFL has specifically referred us to the 2019 FCA 166 
phase 2 Report, a copy of which was sent to us. And STFL went on to explain  
we took on board all the recommendations made by a skilled person and also the 
FCA. As from June 2020 all recommendations were completed and implemented into 
our application and credit decisioning process and these were reviewed by the FCA 
who found all loans analysed to be 100% complaint, and were signed off by the FCA 
These loans followed all policies and procedures and for this reason we believe that 
these loans should not be redressed.
I return to this in the body of the decision. The complaint remained unresolved and was 
passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Ms L has not given any specific response to the adjudicators view or its outcome apart from 
an acknowledgement from her representative. And so, I take it from that she doesnt 
disagree with it and loans 1 to 6 are not disputed. Therefore, I have not reviewed them.
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms L could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers
income and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer.
These factors include:having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Our adjudicator did think this this applied 
to Ms Ls situation from loan 7.
STFL was required to establish whether Ms L could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ls complaint.
STFL says it complied with regulations surrounding the loan approvals. The complaint has 
reached my desk to resolve and Ive reviewed all that STFL has said in reaching this 
decision.
STFL has referred to the Claim Audit Form completed by Ms L for her representative and 
submitted as part of this complaint. STFL says that there are discrepancies between what 
she had told it when she applied for her loans and what the Claim Audit Form states. I agree 
that it is not a document which can be relied on for accuracy of figures as the information 
has not been verified by other financial documents. 
I have looked at the overall pattern of STFLs lending history with Ms L with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which STFL should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STFL ought to have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans.
Given the circumstances of Ms Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7 and 
I say this because, by loan 7, she had been borrowing from STFL for nine months and the
borrowing had continued to increase. For example, loan 2 was for £200 and quite quickly 
into the relationship Ms L started to take two loans on one day. Loans 4 and 5 together 
amounted to £450. 
Ms Ls borrowing and repayment history also shows that a pattern of quick succession had 
clearly formed, with new loans often being taken on the same day the previous loan was repaid. This is something that continued for most of the rest of the lending relationship. And 
it started to develop that Ms L took loans when earlier ones had not been repaid. And it 
escalated further to be occasions when Ms L took two loans in one day or very close 
together.
The amounts being borrowed continued to increase  an example is where two loans taken 
within days of each other in February 2020 came to £800. Overall, I dont think that Ms L 
was making any real inroads to the amount she owed STFL. Loans 23 and 24  being 
almost the last two loans  were taken in February 2020 which was two and a half years 
since the second loan and many times more. Loan 2 was for £100 and loans 23 and 24 
combined were for £800. Shed been indebted to STFL for a long time. Ms L had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STFL over an extended period.
STFL has sent to us a detailed Report which it has confirmed it wanted me to consider in 
relation to loans 25 and 26 approved in September 2020. The Executive Summary of the 
Report tells me that STFL was issued with a Skilled Person Requirement Notice on 
21 October 2019 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Notice required STFL to 
appoint a Skilled Person under s166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 
(FSMA) to undertake various phased Reviews. It goes on to explain that STFL 
ceased lending following the Phase I report in order to implement required changes. 
Following a five-month period of not lending and in line with our recommended 
changes, STF implemented its updated lending policies and processes and 
recommenced lending on 20 July 2020.
Loans 25 and 26 were issued a couple of months after that restart of its lending in July 2020. 
My understanding is that STFL wanted me to consider the fact that the Report demonstrates 
that loans 25 and 26 were approved after it had updated its lending approach. So, I interpret 
that to mean that STFL is submitting to us that the loan approvals for loans 25 and 26 must 
have been satisfactory.
But having read the Report then its clear that the individual cases looked at as part of that 
Review were a sample and theres no indication here that Ms Ls two loans were part of that 
sample. The description in the report is that STFL and the FCA agreed a sample of 40 files 
would be sufficient to identify if STFs lending practices were compliant with the regulators 
rules and principles.
And even if the lending approval of loans 25 and 26 for Ms L was one of those sampled
files, I still think that the repetitive lending concept applies here. We look at all complaints 
here individually. An FCA review after two loans were approved does not necessarily lead 
me to think that the decision to lend was right within the context of Ms Ls lending history. 
I think that Ms L lost out because STFL continued to provide credit to her from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ls indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans over the three year period Ms L was in debt was likely to 
have had negative implications on Ms Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
I am upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 26 and STFL should put things right for Ms L.
Putting things rightIn deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms L from loan 7, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms L may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms L in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Ms L would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options.
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL shouldnt have given Ms L loans 7 to 26. If STFL has sold the outstanding debts it 
should buy these back if able to do so and then take the following steps. If STFL is not able 
to buy the debts back then STFL should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below.
A. STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms L towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything STFL have already refunded.
B. STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms L 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms L originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. STFL should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms L as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms L 
having made overpayments then STFL should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. STFL should then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans . If this results 
in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms L. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then STFL should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Ms L. STFL shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal STFL 
have already written-off.E. The overall pattern of Ms Ls borrowing for loans seven onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so STFL should remove these loans 
entirely from Ms Ls credit file.
STFL do not have to remove loans 25 and 26 from Ms Ls credit file until these have been 
repaid, but STFL should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms L
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ls complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2022.
