K822xcomplaint
Miss H complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford.
background 
Miss H took out a total of 5 loans with QuickQuid between June 2016 and August 2017. She 
topped up the fourth  loan once, and the fifth loan twice.  
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  he 
thought that the checks that QuickQuid  carried  out before making  the first four loans were  
proportionate. He pointed out that those loans  were relatively low compared  to Miss Hs 
declared income, and would have appeared to be affordable after her regular monthly 
expenditure was taken  into account. So he didnt think  QuickQuid had been  wrong  to make 
the first four loans. And even though he thought  that QuickQuid should have asked Miss H 
specifically about  any other outstanding short-term loans before it agreed to top up the fourth 
loan, it would still have  looked as if she could  afford  it.
But the adjudicator thought that when Miss H took out the fifth loan,  QuickQuid should  have  
begun to be concerned that she might be becoming dependent on short-term  lending. And 
he said it should have  carried  out a full review of Miss Hs financial circumstances before 
agreeing to lend further. If it had done  so, he thought it would have realised that she couldnt 
afford to borrow further. So the adjudicator said QuickQuid  should:
Remove  any unpaid  interest and charges from the outstanding balance  on the final 
loan and top-ups (which he referred  to as loans 5, 5a and 5b);
Refund all interest and charges  that Miss H paid on loans 5, 5a and 5b;
Pay interest of 8% simple per year on all refunds from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement
Remove any negative  information about loans 5, 5a and 5b from Miss Hs credit file.
In addition, he said that QuickQuid should  pay Miss H £50 as compensation for the customer 
service she experienced  when she was in financial hardship.
After the adjudicator issued his view, in response to a query  raised by Miss H, he explained 
that there  were, in fact, no unpaid interest or charges  on Miss Hs account. 
QuickQuid agreed to do as the adjudicator had recommended in all respects  other than the 
payment of £50 compensation  to Miss H. Miss H wasnt happy with QuickQuids offer, so the 
complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered Miss Hs borrowing history, I agree with the adjudicators view about 
whether QuickQuid was wrong to make the loans, and for similar reasons to those set out by 
the adjudicator.  
Ref: DRN02284152As QuickQuid has offered  to do as the adjudicator recommended in terms of refunding  
interest and charges on loans 5, 5a and 5b, and removing any negative information  about 
those loans from Miss Hs credit file. I wont consider the irresponsible lending part of 
Miss Hs complaint in further detail here. But I do need to consider whether its appropriate to 
require QuickQuid to pay compensation  to Miss H in addition  to this, as the adjudicator said 
it should.
Miss H says she was experiencing financial hardship and considerable stress, and had to 
seek advice from a debt management company, which set up a repayment  plan.  The debt 
management company  started making  monthly payments to QuickQuid on her behalf in May 
2018. But she says that in spite of this, she received continual phone calls,  text messages 
and a threatening letter from QuickQuid.  And when  she contacted  QuickQuid to explain that 
payments were being made under a debt management  plan, it told her it hadnt been  
receiving payments, and asked her to provide proof that the payments had been made. 
Miss H says she felt that QuickQuid was implying that she was lying. She had to contact the 
debt management  company to ask for evidence that the payments had been  made.  She 
says that even after that, she continued  to receive  communications about non-payment from 
QuickQuid. And shes dissatisfied  that QuickQuid didnt apologise for its mistake.
QuickQuid initially said that it hadnt sent any text messages to Miss H. But after Miss H 
provided evidence  that it had sent her a text message, it accepted that its records did, in 
fact, show that it had sent it. That message  was sent two days  before QuickQuid sent Miss H 
a default notice. And QuickQuid has told us its records show that Miss H phoned it twice 
shortly afterwards.
QuickQuid has contested Miss Hs version  of events. It accepts that it was mistaken  when it 
initially said that it hadnt sent any text messages to Miss H. But it says it didnt send any 
other text messages,  or phone Miss H about missed  payments. And it doesnt accept that 
one text message  would cause Miss H distress.
Miss H hasnt provided any further evidence of the calls and messages she says QuickQuid 
sent. But I can understand  that QuickQuids failure to record  the payments that the debt 
management company  was making on her behalf will have caused her worry and anxiety at 
a time when  she was already struggling.  And I accept that Miss H was caused 
inconvenience by having to contact  the debt management company for proof of the 
payments that it had made. Taking everything  into account, I think that its reasonable to 
require QuickQuid to pay Miss H £50 to reflect  the worry and inconvenience, as the 
adjudicator recommended.
Ref: DRN02284153putting things right
To put things right QuickQuid should  (as it has offered to):
refund all interest  and charges Miss H paid on loans 5, 5a and 5b (made on 4, 9 and 11 
August 2017 respectively);
add interest to those  refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
date of settlement*;
apply the refund first to repay the capital balance outstanding, and pay the balance  to 
Miss H; and
remove any adverse information about loans 5, 5a and 5b from Miss Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs require QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss H a certificate showing how much its taken  off if she asks for one.
In addition, QuickQuid  should pay Miss H £50 to reflect the trouble and upset it caused her, 
as Ive outlined  above.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) to put things  right by doing  as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 July 2019.
