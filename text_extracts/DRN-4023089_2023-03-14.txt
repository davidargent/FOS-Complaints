The complaint
Mrs J complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles (NewDay) was irresponsible when
it offered her a credit facility and later increased her credit limit.
What happened
NewDay opened a credit card account for Mrs J in December 2020 with a credit limit of
£900. This type of credit was an open-ended or running account facility. NewDay
subsequently increased Mrs Js credit limit to £1,650 in May 2021.
Mrs J complained to NewDay that the credit was unaffordable for her and it had been
irresponsible to open the account for her and increase her credit limit. Mrs J said that she
ended up getting further into debt over the years and had to keep borrowing from other
companies, and friends and family.
NewDay said that Mrs J ceased spending on the account the month after the credit limit
increase in May. It then closed Mrs Js account to new purchases in July 2021 following what 
shed said about the account being unaffordable.
NewDay said it acted correctly in providing Mrs J with her Marbles account. It said that it
reviews a customers account alongside external credit reference agency (CRA) data and if it
feels a credit limit increase is suitable, then one will be offered. In this instance a letter was
sent to Mrs J prior to the increase providing her with the option to opt out, which she didnt.
NewDay didnt uphold Mrs Js complaint.
Mrs J brought her complaint to us. Our investigator assessed the complaint and found that
NewDay wasnt irresponsible to have opened the account for Mrs J but that it should have
gone further in its affordability checks when it later increased her credit limit. Mrs J had
exceeded her existing limit the month before the increase was offered. They concluded that,
had proportionate checks been carried out at the time of the increase in May 2021, it was
likely that NewDay would have learnt that Mrs J wasnt in a position to repay further credit
without difficulty and so it wouldnt have increased her limit above £900. They recommended
that NewDay pays Mrs J compensation for this. 
NewDay disagreed with our investigators recommendation and the complaint came to me to 
decide. I issued a provisional decision in January 2023 explaining why I thought Mrs Js 
complaint should be upheld in part but why NewDay didnt have to take any further action. I 
allowed time for both parties to comment on what Id said or provide any new information 
they wished me to consider before making my final decision. Mrs J didnt reply to my 
provision decision. NewDay responded to say that it didnt wholly agree with my findings.
This is my final decision on the matter and will be legally binding if Mrs J accepts it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything again, including what NewDay said in response to my 
provisional decision, I remain of the view that NewDay should have looked into Mrs Js 
circumstances in more detail before increasing her credit limit in May 2021.  However, as 
before, I am not directing it to take any further action. Ill set out my reasoning again in this 
final decision and refer to NewDays comments where appropriate.
 
When making this decision Ive had regard to the regulators rules and guidance on 
responsible lending (set out in its consumer credit handbook  CONC) which lenders, such 
as NewDay, need to abide by. NewDay will be aware of these, and our approach to this type 
of lending is set out on our website, so I wont refer to the regulations in detail here but will 
summarise them.
Before entering into a credit agreement, NewDay needed to check that Mrs J could afford
to repay the credit out of her usual means, within a reasonable period of time, without
having to borrow further and without experiencing financial difficulty or other adverse
consequences. The checks needed to be proportionate to the nature of the credit, for
example the amount offered, and to Mrs Js particular circumstances.
With this in mind, my considerations are did NewDay complete reasonable and proportionate
checks when it first opened the account for Mrs J and later when it increased her credit limit
to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay the credit offered within a reasonable period
of time? If it didnt do this, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown
and, ultimately, did NewDay make fair lending decisions?
Mrs J told NewDay her salary was £20,000 when she applied for the Marbles account and
that she had other household income of £30,000. NewDay recorded that she was a self-
employed non-professional, her existing debt was £600 and she had no adverse information
on her credit file, such as county court judgements, defaults or arrears. NewDay said it used
a CRA tool to check what Mrs J said about her income and to estimate her expenses.
It seems Mrs J was managing her existing accounts with no obvious signs of difficulty and
the amount of money she was borrowing was relatively low compared to what shed said
about her means. Altogether, considering what NewDay knew about Mrs Js circumstances
alongside the amount of credit shed applied for, I think NewDays checks were reasonable
and proportionate and it wasnt irresponsible to open an account for her with this level of
credit.
When NewDay increased Mrs Js credit limit in May 2021 it said that it took into account how
shed been managing her account and any other debts she had. It provided some of the
information it relied on, and Ive reviewed this. I can see that within a month of opening the
account Mrs J had taken out £100 in cash and spent £670. The following month the account
balance was at £850 and went over the limit in April. Mrs J incurred an overlimit fee in May.
NewDay said that it increased Mrs Js limit in line with its internal policy on limit increases
where a customer has incurred over-limit fees. It said it would be unreasonable to consider
that this over limit fee and Mrs Js spending pattern were indicative of financial difficulty,
especially when Mrs J ceased spending on the account a month after the limit increase.
NewDay said Mrs J had been making regular repayments and the information it had about
her other debts didnt show signs of arrears or financial difficulties.
NewDay said in response to my provisional decision that Mrs Js account management 
behaviours did not exclude it from considering her for a credit limit increase. Newday also 
said that in addition to how Mrs J had managed her account, it considered information from her credit file and used a credit reference agency tool to check her account transactions and 
estimate her expenses before offering her a credit limit increase. 
As I explained in my provisional decision, this might be a reasonable and proportionate 
response in some cases. However, in this case NewDay knew Mrs J was self-employed and 
it hadnt looked into her income beyond a sense-check on her bank account deposits, nor to 
my knowledge did it gather any information about her actual living costs or other expenses. 
NewDay has said that it presumed Mrs Js other household income was her partners 
income but I dont think this could provide any reassurance of affordability without some 
further understanding or verification of her circumstances. 
Mrs J told us that she wasnt working at the time and relied on her husband to pay all of the
household bills including her personal finances. I still dont have any supporting information
about Mrs Js circumstances from the time, such as financial accounts, benefit or bank
statements so, in this case, I cant come to a view as to what proportionate checks might
have revealed and how this information might have impacted on NewDays lending decision.
Our usual approach where we find a credit limit has been irresponsibly agreed is to direct the
lender to return any interest and charges that have been applied to spending on the account
above this limit, in other words to consider these charges as overpayments. In this case,
NewDay told us that Mrs J didnt make any transactions on her account after the credit limit
increase and that it closed the account to new transactions in July 2021. So it seems to me
that even if I were to find that NewDay had been irresponsible when it increased Mrs Js 
credit limit, there wouldnt be any refund owing.
NewDay told us that Mrs J has continued to pay more than the minimum payment each
month so her account hasnt fallen into persistent debt and that it hasnt been able to contact
her to discuss the outstanding balance. Ill remind NewDay about its ongoing obligation to
monitor Mrs Js account and treat her fairly, with forbearance and due consideration
regarding her debt. However, I am not directing it to pay her any compensation.
My final decision
As Ive explained above, I am upholding Mrs Js complaint in part about NewDay Ltd trading 
as Marbles but dont require it to pay her compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
