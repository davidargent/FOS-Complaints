The complaint
Mr C is unhappy after National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made both his accounts 
dormant and later defaulted one of them. 
What happened
Mr C has two accounts with NatWest, which both have overdraft facilities. 
NatWest say that one of the accounts hadnt been credited since January 2020, so a 
dormancy flag was applied in January 2021. As both accounts were using the overdraft, they 
were both sent to collections. NatWest say it was their policy at the time to manage accounts 
jointly, in this way.
NatWest say they wrote to Mr C on 27 January 2021, 10 February 2021 and                       
25 February 2021 requesting payments into the account. Mr C has disputed whether these 
letters were sent. He says he didnt receive them and has provided evidence of a postal 
pause in his country of residence during this period. 
As no payments were made to the account, NatWest say they issued a pre-default letter on 
12 March 2021 and then a 60-day default notice on 26 March 2021. A formal demand was 
issued at the end of May, before the accounts defaulted. 
Mr C complained to NatWest. He said that credits had been applied to his accounts and that 
they hadnt done enough to contact him regarding this matter. He also said he hadnt been 
treated fairly as there was a postal pause at the time where he lives, due to the ongoing 
Covid-19 pandemic. 
Our investigator looked into it, but he thought that NatWest has acted fairly. He said that they 
had followed the terms and conditions of the account, made reasonable attempts to contact 
Mr C and applied the default fairly.
As no agreement was reached, the case has been passed to me to reach a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same conclusion as the investigator. Ill explain why. 
Mr C had two current accounts with NatWest. Both accounts had arranged overdrafts. 
Generally, overdrafts are meant for short term borrowing needs and are repayable on 
demand. There is also an expectation the account will be used regularly, fluctuating between 
being in credit and being overdrawn.
One of Mr Cs account (which Ill call A) was used broadly in the way I have described 
above. The other account (which Ill call B) wasnt. Following a credit in January 2020 the 
account went overdrawn in February 2020, and as debits continued over the following 
months the debit grew. The account was credited in February 2021, but the same day a 
large credit took it even further overdrawn. In these circumstances, I find it was reasonable 
for NatWest to want there to be a change in the way the account was being used.
NatWest wrote to Mr C in January, February and March 2021. These letters encouraged him 
to credit B and to make contact. The March 2021 letter said if contact wasnt made the 
overdraft on B would be removed and a default registered with the credit reference agencies 
(CRAs). I find this was reasonable as it gave Mr C opportunity to reassess his overdraft 
needs and discuss them with NatWest.
Mr C argues he didnt get these letters because either they werent sent, or they were 
impacted by Covid-related post issues in his country of residence. Im satisfied from 
NatWests records the letters were sent. And my understanding is they were sent to the 
address held for Mr C. I dont find NatWest was wrong not to notify Mr C by another method. 
And Im not persuaded, based on the evidence Mr C has provided, the postal issue was 
present when all the letters were sent. I find NatWest did enough to notify Mr C there was a 
problem and action was needed. Even if I was persuaded Mr C did not receive these letters, 
I am not satisfied he would have taken action. As to date, my understanding, is that he 
hasnt taken any action taken to bring the accounts up to date.
In late May 2021, NatWest removed the overdrafts and made the accounts inactive. At this 
time A was about £1,700 overdrawn and B was about £1,640 overdrawn. I find this was 
reasonable as NatWest hadnt heard from Mr C, and it was in line with what it said it would 
do. I accept it might have been unclear this would happen to A and B, but I dont consider it 
wrong for NatWest to take a combined approach.
NatWests actions prompted contact from Mr C. Mr C was dissatisfied his accounts could no 
longer be used and his overdrafts withdrawn. He complained. NatWest responded in mid-
June 2021. It explained why it had done what it had and encouraged Mr C arrange to repay 
his overdrawn balances. My understanding is Mr C didnt repay his debts, or agree an 
arrangement, leading to a default being registered for A and B. In light of my findings above, 
I find this was fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
My final decision, for the reasons set out above, is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2022.
