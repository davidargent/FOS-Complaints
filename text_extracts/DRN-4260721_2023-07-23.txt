The complaint
Mr B says Bank of Scotland plc  trading as Halifax (Halifax)  has unfairly declined his 
claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA).
What happened
In 2014, Mr B purchased six participaciones or shares of a company Ill call 
Business 1 from a company Ill call Business 2.
In total, Mr B paid €212,222 for the shares. (Each share had a nominal value of 
€35,370.33.)
He used his Halifax credit card account to make an initial payment of €5,000 
(£4,004.64) on 26 June 2014, and a further payment of €5,000 (£4,004.64) on 
28 June 2014. Mr B paid the balance by bank transfer.
Mr B purchased the shares with his two daughters. According to the notarised sale 
agreement, they owned an equal third parts each, and appointed Mr B to be a 
partner of Business 1.
Mr B says he purchased the six shares because he was told hed fully own a two-
bedroom, seafront apartment in Tenerife after three years  which would be 
transferred into his name  and that hed receive a yearly dividend of 4% until then.
In 2017, Mr B paid Business 2 a further £104,048 for a different investment. He didnt 
use his Halifax credit card account  or any other Halifax account  to pay for this, so 
I cant consider it as part of this complaint.
In June 2020, Mr B  initially with the help of a professional representative (PR)  
wrote to Halifax to make a claim under section 75 of the CCA. He said the 2014 
investment had been misrepresented. And he said that as Business 2 was now in 
liquidation, it couldnt provide the services he had purchased, which was a breach of 
contract.
Halifax declined the claim. It explained that section 75 of the CCA only applies to 
items that cost more than £100 and less than £30,000. As the cash price of the 
investment exceeded £30,000, it said section 75 doesnt apply.
Mr B then referred his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators didnt think it was unfair for Halifax to decline the claim. She 
agreed that section 75 doesnt apply in this case because the value of the investment 
exceeded £30,000.
Mr B disagrees and has asked that an ombudsman make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Section 75(1) of the CCA protects consumers who buy goods and services on credit. It says, 
in certain circumstances, that the finance provider is legally answerable for any 
misrepresentation or breach of contract by the supplier.
However, subsection (3) specifically says that it doesnt apply if the item has a cash price of 
more than £30,000. Here, the cash price of the investment was €212,222, which is 
significantly more than £30,000. 
Mr B says Halifax could have offered him £30,000 or at least refunded the two payments he 
made with his credit card account. 
I can appreciate why Mr B says this, and I understand his frustration and disappointment. 
However, Halifax isnt a party to the underlying contract, and it didnt receive or keep any of 
the money Mr B paid Business 2. Importantly, it didnt do anything wrong. 
Section 75 of the CCA is an unusual piece of consumer protection legislation in that it makes 
a creditor legally answerable for a suppliers wrongdoing  but only in limited circumstances. 
When it doesnt apply, I dont think its unfair for a creditor to decline a claim for a refund of 
some or all of the money thats been paid. And so although I have a great deal of sympathy 
for Mr B, I dont think it was unfair for Halifax to decline his claim.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 August 2023.
