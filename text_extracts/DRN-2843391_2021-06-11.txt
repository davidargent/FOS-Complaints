The complaint
Mr K complains that TSB Bank plc is asking him to repay a higher balance on his credit card 
than he believes is due. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat the full details 
here.  The key facts are:
Mr K ordered an item on line and paid £62.89 for it using his credit card on 27 March 
2020. When he received the item, he didnt believe it was of satisfactory quality or as 
described. He contacted TSB who initially told him to dispute it with the merchant 
through the on-line selling platform. 
On 20 April 2020 a refund for the disputed amount of £62.89 was made, and the 
credit card balance cleared to zero. 
Credit cards statements continued to include a sentence explaining the amount was 
in dispute until March 2021 when Mr K explained he had already received a refund. 
Mr K started spending on his card again in July 2020 and since then has spent 
further on it and made repayments. However, following a payment his balance was 
£62.89 until he spent further. He doesnt accept this amount is owed by him and 
thinks it is in some way connected to the original disputed sum. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint as she was satisfied the balance was 
correct.
Mr K asked for the matter to be reviewed as he is convinced TSB are asking for this money 
twice, once through the refund which should have been the end of the matter and once 
through him. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I have only summarised the findings and arguments above, I would like to reassure 
both parties that I have read and considered everything provided. Having done so, I agree 
with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Mr K received a refund for the disputed amount of £62.89 on 20 April 2020 bringing 
his account to a zero balance. 
He spent £13.65 on his credit card account on 8 July 2020. There was no further 
spending on the account until 21 October 2020. There were also no payments made 
during this time.
His statements show further spending of:
o21 October £9.45
o29 October £39.95
o7 November £22.75
o20 November £99
o16 December £65
o4 February £178
Mr K made three separate repayments during this time of:
o14 December £22.91
o14 January £164
o15 March £178
So when Mr K spent a further £22.75 on 7 March 2021, his balance was correctly 
showing as £85.64 on the March 2021 statement. 
I do understand Mr K has his direct debit set up to clear the outstanding balance. But 
as TSB had £62.89 recorded as being in dispute until March 2021, that amount 
wasnt included in any balance calculations, nor in any repayments that were taken. 
This meant Mr Ks direct debits for the account werent clearing the balance as they 
usually would; it isnt clear whether Mr K was aware of that or not. Im satisfied TSB 
hasnt added this amount back onto the balance; the balance is an accurate 
reflection of the spending and repayments made on the account. 
As I find Mr Ks balance was correct, I dont find any basis on which to ask TSB to make a 
refund or reduce the balance outstanding. 
My final decision
For the reasons given, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2021.
