K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid  lent to him irresponsibly.
background and findings 
I attach the main part of my provisional decision dated 16 August 2019, which forms part of 
this final decision and should be read with it. In it I explained why I intended to uphold  Mr Ms 
complaint in part. Both parties had time to provide any further comments  by 30 August 2019 
before I reached a further decision.  
I have not heard from either party. The reply date has passed. So I have reconsidered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide  what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory 
rules and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
And as nothing further has been received by either party I see no reason to alter the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision on 16 August 2019.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  is to do
Mr M has lost out and QuickQuid needs to put things right and so I direct that it refunds all 
interest and charges from the 24 January 2014  through  to the end of the FlexCredit  account.
QuickQuid needs  to apply 8% simple interest* per year to any interest and charges refunded 
from the date they were  paid to the date of settlement and it needs to remove  any adverse 
payment information  about the credit  account from Mr Ms credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 16 August 2019,  
I uphold Mr Ms complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should put things right for Mr M in the way 
I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 12 October 2019.

background
QuickQuid approved a running account  form of credit  for Mr M with a £400 limit. QuickQuid called this 
product a FlexCredit account. This was approved  on 10 January 2014.  The repayment period was a 
reasonable time. For this account  for Mr M that period was envisaged as ten months assuming the 
drawdown was for the full amount (£400). It was scheduled into that agreement and the example 
repayment amounts and dates were as follows: 
Payment Dates Principal Due Accrued Interest  Minimum Monthly  Repayment
31 January 2014 £40.00 £62.13 £102.13
28 February 2014 £40.00 £82.32 £122.32
31 March  2014 £40.00 £75.98 £115.98
30 April 2014 £40.00 £73.28 £113.28
30 May 2014 £40.00 £58.80 £98.80
30 June 2014 £40.00 £47.27 £87.27
31 July 2014 £40.00 £43.23 £83.23
29 August 2014 £40.00 £28.42 £68.42
30 September 2014 £40.00 £19.50 £59.50
31 October 2014 £40.00 £10.56 £50.56
Mr M had told QuickQuid that his net monthly income was £2,250 and at that stage  QuickQuid did not 
take any details of his declared expenditure. The email correspondence between the parties shows 
that Mr M responded to the QuickQuid request to send  in his payslips in January 2014. 
QuickQuid did carry out credit searches. We have not been sent the full results of those searches  but 
we have been  sent a summary. This summary  is undated. The second wave of searches was carried  
out in March  2017 then June and July 2017. So this summary may relate  to the searches carried  out 
in 2017 not January 2014.
The FlexCredit  account ran from January 2014 to March  2017. QuickQuid has told us that it was 
repaid. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  twice and thought that QuickQuid had done nothing  
wrong. Mr M disagreed and sent to us details of historic credit file records showing accounts  in 
arrears around January  2014. 
The complaint remains unresolved and has been passed  to me. 
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  I consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general  approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  
practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr M could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN14345443But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr M could sustainably repay his account   not just whether the repayments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the repayments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) and its predecessor  the Irresponsible  Lending 
Guide published by the Office of Fair Trading defined sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties 
and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator  explained, a proportionate check for this FlexCredit agreement  in January 2014 
would have included  knowing his income  and his regular  expenditure. QuickQuid did not have details 
of his expenditure and the full credit  check results have not been sent to us. So any regular  
expenditure those searches may have revealed are not known to me. But the limit applied for was 
£400 and the highest proposed repayment  in the example repayment schedule set out in the 
background section of this decision would have been around £122.  
This was Mr Ms first application to QuickQuid and for a £400 limit. With a declared monthly  net 
income of £2,250 where QuickQuid had received  copies of his payslips to verify that, then I think  that 
this was a reasonable lending decision based on proportionate checks. I do not plan to uphold  the 
actual approval of the FlexCredit  account on 10 January 2014. 
However, I have reviewed  the manner  in which QuickQuid then administered  and monitored this 
account and I think that it was poorly done. So I am planning  to uphold the complaint in relation to the 
drawdown on 24 January 2014 and all others after that, through  to the end of the account.  I will 
explain here.
The agreement was for £400.  Mr M drew down £400 on 10 January 2014. On 24 January 2014 Mr M 
received an email reminding him that a payment  of £462.13 was due to be taken  from his account  on 
31 January 2014. So this was in breach of the scheduled repayments as just over £102 was due on 
31 January 2014 not just over £462.  It looks like QuickQuid  was treating the £400 advance as a 
payday loan and asking  for the full amount. 
Ref: DRN14345444This precipitated Mr Ms application for additional funds of £400. This was granted and funds  
deposited on 24 January 2014. This was in breach of the £400 limit agreed just 14 days  earlier as his 
balance on 24 January 2014 became £800 even though it was immediately reduced down  again after 
the additional funds were approved. Just under  £446 was taken as repayments on the same day  24 
January 2014. 
A few days later on 30 January 2014, Mr M applied  again for additional funds and £400 was approved 
taking his balance  to £800 again and so was in breach of the limit. Again this £400 was reapplied to 
the account to reduce the balance.
I have seen no details of any new FlexCredit agreement.  QuickQuid  forwarded to Mr M £1,200 
principal sums  within  20 days  when  he had agreed to a £400 limit. Following this Mr M struggled to 
repay it and after 27 February 2014  he received a whole series of interest and late fees charges. 
The manner in which this FlexCredit account was run from the start was contrary  to the agreement, in 
breach of the limit, and not as expected by Mr M who had been informed that staged  repayments 
were expected. 
As well as these points,  the additional borrowing request on 24 January  2014 ought to have prompted 
additional checks about Mr Ms financial situation which I think  ought  to have included looking at Mr 
Ms regular financial expenditure, loans  and any other short term loans he may have had at the time.
The summary of the QuickQuid credit checks results  referred to in the background  part of this 
provisional decision  is inadequate as it is undated  and only a summary. I have been  sent details by 
Mr M of his personal credit file and I can see that in January 2014 he was in mortgage arrears and 
behind on his repayments on a credit card. These factors, plus the fact that he was asking for another  
£400 within days of the first drawdown on 10 January  2014, lead me to think  that Mr M was struggling 
to manage his finances and not able to repay these additional funds  on the credit account.  
Mr M has lost out and QuickQuid needs to put things right and so I am planning  to direct  that it 
refunds all interest and charges from the 24 January 2014 through  to the end of the account.  
QuickQuid needs to apply 8% simple interest* per year to any interest and charges refunded from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement and it needs  to remove any adverse payment 
information about the credit  account from Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest and it must give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
