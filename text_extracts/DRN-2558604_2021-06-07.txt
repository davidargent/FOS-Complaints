The complaint
Mr P complains about a default registered on his credit file by National Westminster Bank 
Plc.  
What happened
Mr P had a default registered on his credit file in 2010. When management of the debt was 
returned to NatWest in 2016, it incorrectly issued another default to his credit file, resulting in 
the default lasting on his credit file for longer than six years and reporting twice.
Mr P raised a complaint in 2017 and NatWest agreed to remove the default from his credit 
file. This wasnt done correctly, and the default started to re-report on Mr Ps credit file.
Mr P complained to NatWest again. It acknowledged that it had made an error and removed 
the default. It also offered Mr P £250 for the inconvenience caused. 
Mr P wasnt happy with the response and complained to this service. He feels that he should 
be entitled to greater compensation because of the impact this has had on him.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He did t think the compensation offered by NatWest 
was fair and said it should be increased to £500.
Mr P didnt agree with the amount of compensation, so Ive been asked to make a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P has said that he contacted NatWest repeatedly in 2017 to complain that the default 
hadnt been removed following his first complaint. Hes said that NatWest told him that it 
wasnt able to help because it couldnt locate a reference number for his complaint.
Ive reviewed the contact notes provided by NatWest. Theres nothing to suggest that Mr P 
contacted NatWest in 2017. Even if NatWest didnt hold a complaint reference number for Mr 
P, I think its likely that it could have located his account if he had provided his account 
information or other personal information.
I can see that Mr P made a partial settlement payment in 2018 but theres nothing to suggest 
that he raised any complaint about the default or his credit file at this time. If he had tried 
unsuccessfully to contact NatWest in 2017, I think he would have taken the opportunity to 
raise this in 2018 when he made the payment. 
Based on the information Ive seen, the first record of Mr P contacting NatWest about his 
credit file was in January 2020. So, although Mr P has said that hes been impacted by the 
default since 2017, I cant see that he made NatWest aware of the issue until 2020. I dont 
think its fair to expect NatWest to have done something about the default until it was made 
aware that there was an issue.
Ive listened to the calls that Mr P made to NatWest in 2020. Initially NatWest advised Mr P 
that it would arrange to have the default removed within 48 hours. When this didnt happen, 
Mr P contacted NatWest again and was advised that the default was correct and that it 
wouldnt be removed. I can see that NatWest asked Mr P to provide further information if he 
wanted it to review the default, but I cant see that Mr P provided anything until several 
months later. 
Putting things right
NatWest has acknowledged that it made an error by re-reporting the default. Its clear that 
this has impacted on Mr P  hes explained that he was turned down for a mortgage and 
other credit. Theres also been a related impact on his personal life.  Ive looked at Mr Ps 
credit file and 9apart from the default) I cant see anything which is likely to have resulted in 
him being refused a mortgage or credit. So, I think its likely that the default was the reason 
for that.
Taking everything into account, I dont think the compensation offered by NatWest is fair. But 
equally, I dont think NatWest can be held responsible for everything thats happened to Mr P 
over the last few tears. Ive taken into account the fact that, on the available information, 
NatWest was only made aware of the issue with the default in 2020.
Ive also thought about Mr Ps concerns about the customer service he received. Having 
listened to the calls and reviewed the information, I dont think NatWest provided poor 
customer service. I agree with Mr P that there was n occasion when NatWest called a day 
earlier than it said it would and that Mr Ps sister wasnt with him to take the call. However, 
Mr P has said that he was happy to take the call and Im satisfied that NatWest called early 
in order to try and resolve things sooner.
Im aware that Mr P feels that a manager should have called him to discuss compensation. 
Having listened to the calls, I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong here. Once Mr P 
had told the advisor the amount of compensation he was seeking, the advisor was clear that 
this wasnt an amount which could be considered and that the next step would be for Mr P to 
complaint to this service.
Taking everything into account, I agree with the investigator that the amount offered by 
NatWest isnt enough. I think a sum of £500 is fair and reasonable.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr 
P compensation of £500 for distress and inconvenience.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2021.
