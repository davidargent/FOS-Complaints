The complaint
Mr H says National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account without warning.
What happened
Mr H held an account with NatWest, which he last used on 17 January 2017. Due to the lack
of activity on the account NatWest says it wrote to Mr H to inform him the account was due
to close. The account closed on 24 October 2022 and NatWest says the necessary letter
wouldve been sent around nine months beforehand.
Mr H visited the UK and a NatWest branch on 10 October 2022. During Mr Hs branch visit
he requested a new card, which was due to be collected on 27 October 2022. When Mr H
collected the new card, he was informed his account had closed.
Mr H raised a complaint with NatWest, explaining he had not been informed by letter of the
account closure. Mr H also said he wasnt informed when he attended branch to order a new
card of the impending account closure. Mr H said NatWest should compensate him for the
inconvenience caused as he now needs to go through a reclaim process to access his
funds.
NatWest reviewed Mr Hs concerns and issued a final response letter on 10 November 2022.
In its response NatWest explained that it had sent Mr H the relevant letter about the account
closure. It also explained that the branch staff would not have had access to information
about the impending account closure so wouldnt have been able to inform him of this when
he requested a new card.
Dissatisfied with NatWests response Mr H referred his complaint to our service. An
Investigator reviewed Mr Hs concerns and found that NatWest had acted fairly in closing the
account, but as it couldnt show it had communicated the closure to Mr H a £100 payment
was suggested to recognise the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr H. The 
Investigator didnt think NatWest needed to cover any additional costs Mr H says he
incurred.
NatWest agreed with the recommendation made, but Mr H remained unhappy, and asked for
his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
I issued my provisional decision on 7 March 2023, which I have included below.
Provisional Decision
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Hs account was last used in 17 January 2017. The account terms and conditions allow
NatWest to close accounts if there has been no activity for five years. Mr Hs account
appeared to meet this criteria, so I am satisfied that NatWest acted fairly in deciding to close
the account.
NatWest says it wouldve informed Mr H about the impending account closure via letter
around nine months prior to the closure in October 2022. NatWest has the correct address
for Mr H, but Mr H says he never received the letter. NatWest hasnt been able to provide a
copy of the letter it says Mr H wouldve been issued. It also hasnt been able to provide any
further evidence to demonstrate the letter was sent to Mr H. Without this evidence, I think its
reasonable to conclude that Mr H wasnt notified of the account closure prior to his UK visit.
Mr H attended branch on 10 October 2022 and requested a new card. This request was
processed by the branch staff and Mr H was informed he could collect the card on 27
October 2022. Mr H says the branch staff shouldve informed him when he requested the
new card of the impending account closure. Based on the circumstances, I think Mr Hs
expectation is fair. I note NatWests comments that its staff wouldnt have had access to this
information. However, I think this view fails to take a holistic view of Mr Hs customer
experience. Mr H had requested a new card which indicated he wished to use the account. I
understand this activity in itself may not have stopped the account closing, but it clearly
showed Mr H was unaware of the impending closure and it wouldve been appropriate to
explain this to Mr H at the time. From Mr Hs perspective he hadnt received any notice about
the account closing, and if there was any important information regarding his account that he
needed to know, its reasonable for him to think that the NatWest branch staff wouldve
communicated this to him.
Ive considered the impact of this communication failing on Mr H. I can see the Investigator
recommended NatWest pay Mr H £100 in compensation, and Mr H thinks this amount fails
to recognise the impact on him. I understand Mr H has spent time and effort trying to resolve
his account issues, and he feels the amount awarded should take into account all of his
costs. Reaching an award for distress and inconvenience is seldom straightforward. The
issues involved are subjective by their very nature and the impact on the consumer can be
difficult to determine. In Mr Hs case I recognise he received poor service, and NatWest
shouldve done more to assist Mr H. I think £200 more accurately reflects the impact on Mr H
and is in line with our services approach to compensation.
Mr H has explained that in order to reclaim the funds in his account he needs to complete
the necessary forms and use a notary as he is based abroad. Given Mr Hs comments and
the circumstances of his complaint I am persuaded that Mr H wouldve taken steps to keep
his account open had he been aware of NatWests closure plans. So, I think it would be fair
for NatWest to cover the notary costs which Mr H will have to incur to access these funds.
Responses to the provisional decision
NatWest replied to the provisional decision, explaining it accepted my findings.
Mr H responded explaining that although my decision recognised NatWests failing the £200 
recommended was inadequate. Mr H says the amount failed to fully consider the amount of 
work and travel involved in trying to resolve his complaint. Mr H did however ultimately 
accept the recommendation. But he asked that I direct NatWest to pay the expenses he 
incurred (estimated at £1,500) to a charity selected by this service.  
As both sides have responded to my provisional decision, I will now issue my final decision 
on the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about Mr Hs comments, but I still dont think it would be fair to hold NatWest 
responsible for all the expenses Mr H says he incurred. Whilst NatWest couldve done more 
in its dealings with Mr H and his account closure, I dont think it would be fair to hold it 
responsible to the extent Mr H has outlined. Instead, I think £200 more accurately reflects 
the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr H. 
I also wont be directing NatWest to make a payment to a nominated charity. We are an 
impartial service so it wouldnt be appropriate for me to direct NatWest to make such a 
payment. Our role is to determine whether NatWest treated Mr H fairly, and to award 
compensation for the impact any shortcomings had on Mr H. So whilst I understand Mr Hs 
sentiments, I will not be directing NatWest to pay any additional compensation, to either him 
or a charity. I understand this will come as a disappointment to Mr H as he feels so strongly 
about his complaint, but I hope my provisional decision and final decision explain why I have 
taken this approach.
Putting things right
NatWest should do the following to put things right for Mr H:
Pay Mr H £200 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience caused by its failure 
to properly communicate with Mr H about his account closure.
Cover the notary costs Mr H will incur in order to access the funds in his account. 
Based on information provided by Mr H a £15 payment will cover these costs.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and require National Westminster Bank 
Plc to put things right by doing what Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2023.
