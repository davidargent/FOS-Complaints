The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) continued to apply interest to 
his loan whilst he was on a payment break.
 
What happened
Mr S has a loan with NatWest. Mr S missed a payment in February 2020. In early April 2020 
Mr S spoke with NatWest and discussed a payment break for his loan. Mr S has told us his 
income had been impacted by the pandemic and that he was waiting to start a new job. 
NatWest approved an initial payment break of three months and explained there would be 
no impact to Mr Ss credit file. Mr S says that NatWest failed to explain interest would 
continue to accrue during the payment break period of three months. 
In July 2020 NatWest approved a second payment break. The new payment break covered 
July, August and September 2020. In October 2020 Mr S began making payments again. 
In December 2020 Mr S complained when he found interest had continued to accrue against 
his loan balance during the payment break. Mr S says this wasnt explained when he called 
NatWest to apply. Mr S also says he was given confusing and misleading information about 
arrears on his account when he discussed the issue with NatWest. 
NatWest sent Mr S a final response and confirmed that interest continued to accrue during 
the payment breaks it offered. NatWest explained that Mr S had missed the February 2020 
payment which was separate to the payment break balance that accrued. NatWest refunded 
£45.12 of arrears interest and paid Mr S £75 as it failed to log his complaint correctly. 
Mr S referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. During the 
investigation NatWest offered Mr S a further £100 to resolve his complaint. The investigator 
agreed NatWest hadnt made it clear interest would continue to accrue when Mr S applied 
for the payment breaks. But the investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly by 
continuing to charge interest as the approach was in line with Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) guidance. 
Mr S asked to appeal and said he was advised it was a payment hold which meant his loan 
account would effectively freeze. Mr S also advised hed called NatWest to check everything 
was fine and made a payment to help clear arrears in April 2020. Mr S also said hed been 
given misleading information about the arrears balance. As Mr S asked to appeal, his 
complaint has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to Mr S calls with NatWest. During the call in April 2020 the call handler 
confirmed Mr S had missed a payment in February 2020. Mr S asked to apply for the 
payment break. I didnt hear the call handler say Mr Ls loan account would be frozen as a 
result. The call handler did talk about repaying the deferred amounts at the end of the 
payment break. But the line was poor and I didnt think the explanation was clear. So I can 
understand why Mr S didnt pick up on the fact interest would continue to accrue, despite the 
payment break being agreed. But I think its fair to note that there was never an option for Mr 
S to take a payment break without interest being applied to his loan.
I need to consider what Mr S wouldve done if the way interest accrued had been clearly 
explained. Ultimately, Mr S has explained his situation at the time was strained because of 
the pandemic and that a new job was delayed. I can see Mr S missed February 2020s 
payment and hes told us about the pressures of work at the time. I think its more likely than 
not that Mr S wouldve still proceeded even if NatWest had clearly explained interest would 
continue to accrue during the payment break. I havent been persuaded that Mr S is in a 
worse position as a result of the way NatWest explained the payment break process. 
NatWest paid Mr S £75 to apologise for service issues when he complained. I can see 
NatWest has provided some information that couldve been clearer and I think thats 
impacted the arrears details Mr S was given. NatWest has agreed to increase its offer by a 
further £100. In my view, thats a fair way to resolve Mr S complaint and reflects the service 
provided. So Im going to endorse the increased offer to resolve Mr S complaint. But, for the 
reasons Ive given above, Im not telling NatWest to refund interest that was applied to Mr S 
loan during the payment break. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr S complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to 
settle as follows: 
- If it hasnt done so already, refund £45.12 of interest to the loan account
- Pay Mr S a further £100 taking the total award for the distress and inconvenience 
caused to £175
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
