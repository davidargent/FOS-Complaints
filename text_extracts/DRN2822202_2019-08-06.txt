K820x#14complaint
Ms M is unhappy about the way National Westminster Bank Plc handled an overdraft facility  
on a joint bank account. 
background
Ms M complains NatWest  didnt tell her about  the conversations they had with her ex-
husband about the outstanding overdraft on a joint bank account  she says NatWest have 
breached data protection. She believes the overdraft would negatively  affect  her credit file 
and the other account she holds with NatWest.  Ms M says she felt pressured into paying  the 
outstanding amount on the joint account  which  then led to the closure of the account. Ms M 
wants NatWest to reimburse her expenses  and also compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience this has caused her.
NatWest say as Ms M and her ex-husband are both responsible for the overdraft on the joint 
account - they can pursue both parties either jointly or individually  for repayment of the debt. 
So they dont  think they did anything wrong in pursuing Ms M for the overdraft debt. 
NatWest reimbursed Ms M with the same amount she paid to clear the overdraft on the joint 
account as a gesture of goodwill. NatWest also told Ms M her other account would remain 
open and that a default wouldnt be applied to her credit  file in relation to this matter.
Our adjudicator looked into this complaint. He said NatWest hadnt  done anything in wrong  
in contacting Ms M about  the overdraft amount on the joint account  and that this was in line 
with the accounts terms and conditions. He also said NatWest didnt need  to pay Ms M any 
compensation for trouble  and upset. Ms M disagreed. She didnt think NatWest  had put her 
back in the position she wouldve been  in had this matter not occurred. So the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked first at the terms and conditions for the account. They say NatWest are able to 
discuss an account with any of the account  holders. And that this can happen without the 
consent of the other account  holder. They also say that all account holders are responsible 
to pay back any overdraft  on the account  and that NatWest can ask all or just one of the 
account holders  to repay the full amount of any money owed and not just a share. This 
applies even  if the account holder is, for some reason, unaware that an overdraft has been  
used on the account. 
Ive considered Ms Ms view that NatWest should have told her about the conversations  they 
had with her ex-husband. Whilst I cant be sure what conversations may have taken place  I 
dont think NatWest have  done anything wrong. I say this because the terms and conditions 
confirm theyre able to discuss an account  with any of the account holders without the 
consent of the other.
Ref: DRN28222022NatWest have sent us a copy of their internal notes showing the conversations  they had with 
Ms M about paying  the overdraft on the account  which Ive carefully looked at. Based  on 
these notes, I havent seen anything to persuade  me that Ms M was pressured in to pay the 
outstanding overdraft on the joint account. And as Ms M was jointly liable for the overdraft, I 
dont think NatWest did anything wrong  in pursuing her for it.
Ive considered whats happened in the round in relation  to this part of Ms Ms complaint and 
I believe the gesture  of goodwill NatWest  made  was generous. I say this because as Ms M 
was one of the account holders, she was responsible for the overdraft, regardless of whether 
she was aware it had been used or not. This means  NatWest didnt have to return  to Ms M 
the sum shed paid to clear the outstanding  overdraft. So I wont  be asking NatWest to do 
anything more.
NatWest have told us theyll  make sure a default isnt applied  to Ms Ms credit file and that 
her other account with them  is still open.  Ms M is welcome to check  her credit file should she 
have any concerns about this. NatWest have also told us the joint account Ms M held with 
her ex-husband is closed  and that there isnt an outstanding debt on it. As a result  of this, 
theyve confirmed Ms M wont be pursued  in relation to the debt on this joint account.
Next, Ive gone on to consider the impact Ms M says this complaint has had on her. Ms M 
says this issue has caused her a lot of inconvenience and its clear shes  found what  
happened here very distressing. NatWest  have acknowledged that at times theyve not given 
her a good service.  Ive thought about  this carefully  and I wont be ordering NatWest to 
compensate Ms M for reasons Ill go on to explain.
NatWest were aware of Ms Ms concerns about  the service they provided by the time they 
agreed to pay her an amount equal  to the debt she cleared on the joint account with her ex-
husband. Ive considered  what  the bank did in the round and I think  its reasonable to treat 
the amount NatWest  paid Ms M as compensation for any trouble and upset she may have 
been caused. I say that, not least, given the conclusion Ive already  drawn   that it was 
reasonable for the bank  to hold Ms M liable for the entire overdraft debt. I appreciate 
NatWest may have told Ms M she would be entitled to compensation, but as Ive already 
explained, Im satisfied the amount  theyve  already  paid fairly compensates  her.
Ms M also mentioned she sought  legal advice in order to assist her with this matter. It was 
Ms Ms choice to seek legal advice  instead  of, for example, immediately referring her 
complaint to us. So I wont be ordering NatWest to reimburse Ms M for any legal fees she 
may have  had to pay.
Ref: DRN28222023my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 September 2019.
