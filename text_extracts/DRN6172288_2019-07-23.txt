K821x#15complaint
Miss D complains that Clydesdale Financial  Services Limited (trading as Barclays Partner  
Finance) (BPF) lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint a copy of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Miss Ds complaint. I invited 
Miss D and BPF to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to make 
before I finally determined the matter.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss D agreed with my provisional decision. 
BPF provided me with some further information  about the checks it carried  out before 
lending to Miss D. It told me it would  have considered a number of factors  including  credit  
history and ability to pay.
Ive taken this additional  information  into account.  But Im still not persuaded that BPF 
carried out adequate checks, taking into account the size of the loan.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in my provisional decision  my final decision is 
to uphold the complaint.
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited  should:
Refund all payments made by Miss D whilst she has been in the payment plan 
together with 8% simple interest per annum from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
Write  off the balance  on the loan
Remove all reference  to the loan from Miss Ds credit file
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 August 2019.
