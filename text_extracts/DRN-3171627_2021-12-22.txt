The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) cancelled his credit card and 
charged an annual fee.
What happened
Mr P had had a credit card from NatWest since 1988. In February 2020, his card account 
was debited with the annual fee of £84. The card wasnt reissued in March 2020, and the 
card account was closed by NatWest in August 2020.
Mr P complained  he hadnt received a renewal card in March 2020 and when he tried to 
use it later, in November 2020, it was declined. This caused him embarrassment. NatWest 
had charged the annual fee of £84  and so should have provided him with a new card to 
use. Later, when NatWest agreed to refund the fee of £84, they should have added interest 
of 8% to the refund. He said he hadnt received a letter from NatWest about the closure of 
his account.
NatWest said they closed Mr Ps credit card account as it wasnt being used. They said this 
was in line with the terms and conditions of the account. Theyd written to him to give him 
notice of its closure. They said they couldnt be responsible if Mr Ps letter hadnt been 
delivered. They hadnt made an error, but in January 2021, refunded the fee of £84 as a 
gesture of goodwill. 
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest had acted fairly. Mr Ps card 
account hadnt been used for a long time, and NatWests terms and conditions say they 
could close the account if they wished. NatWest couldnt show us the actual letter that was 
sent to Mr P  only a sample. But he was persuaded that NatWests processes had been 
followed and the letter was sent. NatWest had refunded the card fee, and he felt that was 
reasonable.
Mr P asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at NatWests terms and conditions. These say they can close an account if they 
wish. These say: we may suspend, restrict or withdraw the use of any card or the account 
and/or reduce the Credit Limit and Advance Limit at any time. Any merchant or machine may 
then retain any card. You will be told before this action is taken, or as soon as possible 
afterwards. You may request restoration of a card and/or the account by calling the number 
at the end of these General Conditions.
We may end the Agreement at any time after giving you written notice, which in normal 
circumstances will not be less than two months. When this happens, information about you 
and the account to credit reference agencies.
NatWest say they took the decision during 2020 and wrote to Mr P then. They showed us a 
sample of the letter that would have been sent. This says We've noticed you haven't used 
your credit card ending xxx for at least 9 months. It looks like you might not need it anymore, 
so we're planning to close it on xxxx. Having extra cards around that you don't use can be a 
security risk.  Don't worry. you've still got time. Just use your card by the xxxx and we'll 
keep your credit card open for you. If you've used your card in the last month, please ignore 
this letter.
Mr P says he didnt receive such a letter  and NatWest cant show us the actual letter that 
was addressed to Mr P and sent to him. So  I must make a decision here based on the 
balance of probability as to what happened here.
I can see that Mr P hadnt used his credit card for a long time  Ive looked at his credit card 
statements, there hadnt been any transactions since March 2015. In those circumstances, 
its quite normal for a bank to close the account  as its clear that a customer doesnt need 
it. And as NatWests letter says, having cards laying around which arent being used  give a 
higher risk that they will be used by criminals for fraud. So  most banks, including NatWest, 
close dormant accounts to protect customers. 
Mr P says he didnt receive a letter from NatWest about the closure of his card account  but 
having considered NatWests processes, Im persuaded that a letter was sent. And this 
service takes the view that once a letter had been despatched, a business cant be held 
responsible for its delivery.
I appreciate that when Mr P tried to use his card, and it was declined, he was embarrassed. 
But  on balance, and in the circumstances of this case, Im not persuaded to uphold his 
complaint. NatWest refunded the fee of £84 as a gesture of goodwill  which I think was fair. 
Mr P says he should also receive interest of 8% per annum on top of that. I should say that 
the award of this is discretionary, and not a right. And its only considered if a business has 
made an error  which NatWest havent in this case. So, I wont be asking NatWest to make 
any further payment to Mr P.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2022.
