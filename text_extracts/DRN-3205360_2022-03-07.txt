The complaint
Miss D says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LaH), irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says that she struggled to repay the lending and she was frequently offered new loans 
before the ones she was repaying had ended. She said she had to keep borrowing to repay 
these loans.
What happened
This complaint is about 15 home collected loans LaH provided to Miss D between 
September 2015 and May 2018. Some of the information I have been provided about the

LaH has looked at this complaint and it said that, due to the lack of information it had, it 
would pay compensation for loans 1 to 3. It didnt think that the remainder of the loans were 
lent irresponsibly. 
Our adjudicator upheld Miss Ds complaint in part. She didnt disagree that LaH should pay 
compensation for loans 1 to 3. But she wasnt persuaded that loans 4 and 5 were mis-sold. 
Looking forward, she thought that loans 6 to 15 shouldnt have been given. This is because, 
in her view the lending pattern itself seemed harmful from loan 6 onwards.   
LaH disagreed. It said that Miss D borrowed modest amounts each year and the loans 
looked to be affordable. She only used one form of credit and the repayments were no 
higher than 27% of her declared income. She didnt have significant problems repaying the 
loans. So, it didnt agree that the lending pattern looked to be harmful. 
As no agreement was reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
issue a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LaH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Miss D could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Miss D didnt disagree with LaHs offer to pay compensation for loans 1 to 3. And she didnt 
disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 4 and 5. Because of this, I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And I dont disagree with these 
outcomes for the same reasons as LaH and the adjudicator said. Ive included loans 1 to 3 in 
my putting things right section below. 
And these loans were part of the borrowing relationship Miss D had with LaH. So, they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
Ive considered the pattern of lending up to loan 6 and I think the loan history and pattern of 
lending itself demonstrates that further lending was likely to be unsustainable. So, I think 
LaH was irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
This is because:
Miss D had taken out six loans over 14 months. Her first loan was for £225 and loan 
6 was for was for £500. 
So, Miss D had a significant, and rapid, increase in the use of this type for credit right 
from the start. And the led to, for example, Miss D taking four loans in 2016 which 
totalled £2,100.
And right from the start Miss D was provided with a new loan when she hadnt fully 
repaid the loans she had. Its notable that at loan 6 she hadnt repaid loans 4 and 5. 
The ongoing repayments of £50 a week would take up a large part of her disposable 
income which was about £120 a week. 
So, by loan 6, LaH ought to have known that Miss D was not likely borrowing to meet 
a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. And that she wasnt 
managing to repay her loans sustainably.
LaH seems to be saying that because Miss D was paying her loans on time then it 
was still reasonable to lend. But I can see that by 2018 she was nearly £300 in 
arrears. So, I dont think that she was always paying her loans on time and its clear 
that she was experiencing problems. And I think that LaH couldve expected this 
wouldve happened, given the earlier loan history. 
I dont think LaH shouldve provided loans 1 to 3 and loans 6 to 15 to Miss D. And Im 
upholding her complaint about these loans. Putting things right
In deciding what redress LaH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had It not lent loans 1 to 3 and 6 to 15. Clearly there are a great many 
possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss D may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Miss D in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Miss D would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LaHs liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LaH shouldnt have given Miss D loans 1 to 3 and loans 6 to 15.
A) LaH should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss D towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) LaH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss D 
which was considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LaH should pay Miss D the total of A plus B.
D) LaH should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Miss Ds credit file in 
relation to loans 1 to 3. The overall pattern of Miss Ds borrowing for loans 6 to 15 means 
any information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Ds credit file. If LaH has sold any of the loans LaH should ask the debt purchaser 
to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LaH to deduct tax from this interest. LaH should give 
Miss D a certificate showing how much tax LaH has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ds complaint. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 April 2022.
