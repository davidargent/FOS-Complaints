Mrs G complains that NewDay  Ltd mistakenly told her that she didnt have to make  a credit 
card payment after it failed to collect her direct debit. 
background 
Mrs G has a NewDay credit card and repays  the full outstanding balance each month. In 
August 2018 a payment  of £1,339  was due to be collected by NewDay but because of some 
technical problems  it wasnt.  
NewDay emailed Mrs G about  what had happened. Mrs G thought  the email  was ambiguous  
so called NewDay and asked whether she needed to make  up the missed payment. Mrs G 
was told that she didnt have to make  her August 2018 payment. 
Mrs Gs explained that she called NewDay on a number of occasions  and was consistently 
given the same information  that she didnt  have to make up August 2018s payment. 
Around 13 August  2018 Mrs G called NewDay to check again and this time was told shed 
have to make up the payment and that it wouldnt be written off. Mrs G complained. 
NewDay looked into Mrs Gs complaint and initially offered £20 to resolve  it. NewDay  
subsequently increased the offer to £30 but Mrs G didnt think that was fair so referred her 
complaint to this service.  
When NewDay sent us its case submission it said it wanted to increase the settlement  
offered to Mrs G to £100. The adjudicator  looked at what happened and said they thought 
NewDays offer was fair so didnt ask it to do anything  else.  Mrs G asked for her complaint to 
be appealed  so its been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When Mrs G asked to appeal  her complaint she specifically  wanted me to note that shed 
been told she didnt  have to make the payment up on numerous occasions. And while  Ive 
not been able to listen to all of her calls, I dont  doubt what Mrs G says. But even  accepting  
that Mrs G was told she wouldnt have  to make the payment up several  times,  Im of the view 
that it was fair for NewDay to ask her to do so later. 
In this case, NewDays made a number mistakes. It incorrectly failed to take August 2018s 
direct debit payment  and then told Mrs G she wasnt required to make it up. And I accept 
that its missed opportunities to correct its errors with Mrs G. 
As I agree that Mrs Gs complaint should be upheld Ive focused  on what  NewDay should do 
to put things right. Mrs G says she thinks NewDay should be bound by its error and 
shouldve waived the £1,339 payment.  But Mrs G spent the money  she owed so I think  its 
fair that she repaid it. While Id expect a business  to make an offer to reflect  a mistake its 
made, I dont  think it should  be bound by a genuine error. And Im satisfied the incorrect 
information Mrs G was given was a genuine  error.  
Ref: DRN01288992NewDay took steps to ensure Mrs Gs credit file wasnt  affected  by its mistake and that she 
wasnt charged when  the August 2018  payment  didnt go through. NewDay  didnt charge any 
interest (which given Mrs G clears her balance each month  is reasonable) and offered her 
£30 to apologise. NewDays since increased  the offer to £100. 
Ive thought carefully about what happened and Ive taken into account  what  Mrs G has told 
us about her circumstances around this time. Having  done so, Im satisfied the £100 
NewDays offered fairly reflects  the impact of its error on Mrs G. As a result,  Im not telling 
NewDay to pay more  or take any further action to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  NewDay  Ltd to pay Mrs G £100.  Under  
the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service, Im required  to ask Mrs G to accept or reject  
my decision  before 18 March 2019.
