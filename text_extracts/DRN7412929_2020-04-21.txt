K820x#14complaint
Mr J is unhappy that TSB Bank plc wont refund the losses he says he incurred as a result  of 
him borrowing money from friends,  after he was the victim of a scam.  
background
Mr J received an email offering him a driving job. He was told he would be sent a cheque for 
£3,720 to cover his wage and to make  payments to arrange car hire to pick up a couple from 
the airport who were relocating.  On receipt  of the cheque he cashed  it as a TSB branch on 
19th April. 
Mr J says he couldnt log into his online banking, so he called  TSB on 21 April 2018. He says 
TSB couldnt make the payment, but he asked  TSB if he was in any danger when making  
payments using other funds and described  the situation. He said he was told by TSB that it 
would be fine for him to make payments.
Because he was told this, Mr J says he used his girlfriends account (held with a different 
bank) to make the payments  as requested. 
Mr J has shown the following payments were  made  from his girlfriends account.
Date Amount Payment method
20/04/2018 £1,200 Faster payment  online 
23/04/2018 £1,200 Faster payment  online 
24/04/2018 £900 Faster payment  online 
On 24 April 2018, after the last payment, the cheque bounced. It appears Mr J went  to a 
branch on 27 April 2018 to find out what had happened. He asked the scammer why the 
cheque had bounced but soon realised he had been the victim of a scam when he couldnt 
reach the scammers by email. 
TSB investigated Mr Js complaint but didnt think it would have given  the advice that Mr J 
says he received. TSB also didnt have any records of the calls Mr J said he had made to 
TS. Overall it didnt  think it had made  any mistake. Unhappy with TSBs final response Mr J 
brought his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators  looked into things. He concluded that he thought  it was possible 
Mr J had called TSB to query the cheque. But he thought, on balance,  it was likely, that Mr J 
had only asked if the money  was in his account, at which point, he would have been told it 
wasnt. He didnt think that TSB would have given him advice that the money was safe  and 
ready to use as Mr J says he was told. He felt TSB staff would have  known about  cheque 
clearing cycles and wouldnt have likely given this advice, as the cheque  hadnt cleared on 
the date that Mr J says he called TSB.  
The investigator also thought that Mr J hadnt  suffered a loss from his own bank account but 
instead it was his girlfriends  account where  the transfers had been made from. He wasnt  
considering the transactions from Mr Js girlfriends account as her account  was held with a 
different bank. 
Overall, he concluded  that TSB didnt need  to reimburse Mr J in the circumstances. 
Ref: DRN74129292Mr J disagreed. In summary he said:
-The only reason he couldnt transfer  the money from his account  (and had to use his 
girlfriends account)  was because of TSBs IT issues.
-He believed TSB were  deliberately not providing evidence of the calls he made to 
them to query the cheque.
Since the initial view Mr J has provided  some further  information. Including:
-Statements for his girlfriends account  showing  the transactions  made from her 
account to the scammer.
-Email  conversations  between him and the scammer which show he knew about  the 
time it would take for the cheque  to clear.
-Evidence of Mr J calling TSB on 20th April from his mobile.
These show Mr J called TSB at the following times:
Date Time Duration of call
20/04/18 14:54 6 seconds
20/04/18 15.01 9 minutes
20/04/18 16.23 7 minutes
TSB have  also provided some further information:
-Mr Js online banking records showing the times and dates he logged in.
-It has found records of the calls Mr J made  on 20th April (using the information Mr J 
had provided from his phone records).  But it says these were made to the IVR 
system (this is the automated phone system) and TSB says this shows that Mr J did 
not speak to a person during these calls. 
TSBs records show that Mr J logged in to his online banking  and called the IVR system at 
the following  dates  and times:
Date time Type of activity  
19/04/18 18.09 Online banking log in
20/04/18 13.58 Online banking log in

my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
conclusions as the investigator for largely  the same  reasons. I have seen additional  
evidence since the investigators view and have included reference  to them  here, but they 
dont change the overall outcome of the complaint. 
Did Mr J call TSB?
When the investigator issued his opinion on Mr Js complaint,  he didnt have any evidence  
that Mr J had called TSB,  but he was willing to accept that he did make  calls . He didnt 
however think that Mr J was given  the advice that he says he was given. 
Ive now received additional evidence  since then, which I think casts doubt on whether Mr J 
spoke to anyone  at TSB at all. I say that because Mr Js evidence shows  that he made 
successful calls to TSB at around 3pm and 4.30pm on 20 April 2018. But TSBs  evidence is 
that Mr J used its automated system (the IVR) rather than speaking to anyone at TSB.  
Without the call recordings I cant be certain  that Mr J used the IVR, but I do find the 
evidence from TSB persuasive. They correspond with times that Mr J says he called.  And 
the calls are short which doesnt necessarily suggest Mr J was able to get through  to 
someone to have a conversation.  
If I take TSBs evidence  as being correct, then Mr J didnt receive  any advice about the 
cheque and the safety of making  payments before it had cleared.  And as such  I think  Mr J 
chose to send  the payments without relying  on any information from TSB. 
But Im willing to accept  that its possible that Mr J did speak to someone when he called 
TSB. But like the investigator I dont  find it likely  that TSB would have given the advice that 
Mr J says he received. The cheque would have been subject  to the standard cheque 
clearing cycle. Which means  the cheque can be returned as unpaid  up until the sixth day. 
This is well known within the banking industry  so I dont find it plausible that TSB staff would 
have made  a comment that it would have been  safe  for Mr J to use his own funds, or 
someone elses on 20 April (which is only a day after the cheque had been  deposited)  and 
long before the cheque would have cleared.
Im persuaded that if Mr J did speak to TSB, they would have explained  that the cheque 
wouldnt have cleared until day six at the earliest. And I think  Mr J knew this based on the 
emails he had with the scammers  which Ill cover in my findings  below.
Other evidence which points to Mr Js knowledge
Mr J says he couldnt log on to his online banking, so he called TSB instead. But TSB has 
provided its online banking logs which show  that Mr J logged in several times after he 
deposited the cheque and during the time that he was arranging  for the payments to be 
made from his girlfriends account. 
Ref: DRN74129294TSB was having IT issues  during this time so I cant be certain what Mr J saw when he 
logged in or attempted to log in during  these  times.  So, Ive gone on to consider the email 
conversation he had with the scammers  and explain what I think this shows about Mr Js 
knowledge of the cheque.
As Ive said Ive also seen  the email exchanges  between Mr J and the scammers.  Ive 
transcribed the emails  below  as they appear. In an email to the scammer on 19 April Mr J 
says:
I have received  the cheque for £3,720 this morning and did diposite  it in my bank it would 
take about five working days to get through until I can use that money so u can tell me what  
u want me to do next
On the 20 April he goes  on to say: 
I think  it will be available from Wednesday on the 25th but I can use my own money  to get 
the car ready  before  that u know if you are due in the UK by 27th it would be better to be the 
car ready a bit earlier
On 25 April Mr J emails the scammer to say:
the money is not been through,  yet the bank  is still going through some  issues  since  Friday I 
am going there today to see whats happening  its not just me its to everyone  the whole TSB 
branch
From these emails I think its clear that Mr J had understood the cheque hadnt cleared.  But 
he was willing to use other funds in the meantime to make the payments that had been 
requested. This could  be either: 
-because it was clear from his online banking that the cheque  hadnt cleared (hence 
him checking his account during this time);
-from speaking to TSB as Ive mentioned  above;  or 
-because of his general knowledge about  cheques.
Mr J doesnt mention in these emails that he had checked and had been reassured by TSB 
that the funds  would credit his account and he would be safe to take the actions that he 
did. Im persuaded  that the emails  demonstrate that he decided to take this action himself 
without advice. And I think the emails support my finding that TSB didnt give him the advice 
that he was safe to send  money from other sources before the cheque  had cleared.
I appreciate that looking back Mr J will be frustrated  by the actions that he took by sending 
the money before the cheque had cleared in his account. And that hell be disappointed with 
my findings.  But I dont think TSB should  refund his losses here. 
Ref: DRN74129295my final decision
As Ive set out above, I dont uphold  Mr Js complaint against TSB Bank plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
