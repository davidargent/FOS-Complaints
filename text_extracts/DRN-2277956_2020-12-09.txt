The complaint
Mr C complains about the way that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as 
Barclays Partner Finance, has dealt with two fixed sum loan agreements that he used to pay 
for mobile phones.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr C entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in 
November 2018 to pay for a mobile phone  the cost of the phone was £1,149 and 
the amount of the loan was £1,080 which he agreed to repay by 20 monthly 
payments of £54;
he traded-in that phone for a replacement phone in September 2019 and entered into 
another fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for it  the 
cost of the phone was £1,199, the trade-in value of the first phone was £370 and he 
paid £20 by other means - so the amount of the loan was £809 which he agreed to 
repay by 23 monthly payments of £33.99 and a final payment of £27.23 (both 
agreements were interest free);
it was clearly Mr Cs understanding that the first agreement would be cancelled when 
he entered into the second agreement so he stopped making the monthly payments 
of £54 which caused his account to go into arrears and he received letters about his 
debt from Barclays Partner Finance and from a debt collector;
he complained to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2019 that it hadnt 
cancelled the first agreement but he wasnt satisfied with its response so complained 
to this service  hes also made another compaint to Barclays Partner Finance about 
the service that he received from it in relation to a phone call in February 2020  but 
that didnt form part of his original complaint and is being dealt with separately so I 
havent considered it as part of this complaint;
Ive seen no documentary evidence to support Mr Cs claim that the supplier told him 
that the first agreement would be cancelled when he traded-in the phone and Im not 
persuaded that its likely that it would have done so;
when he traded-in the phone in September 2019 he still owed £540 to Barclays 
Partner Finance under the first agreement and the supplier gave him a trade-in value 
of £370 for that phone  so his claim is based on the value of a used phone that was 
about a year old and which had cost £1,149 when new being £910 (the outstanding 
amount of the loan plus the trade-in value) and I dont consider that either the 
supplier or Barclays Partner Finance would have agreed to that;
the arrangement for him to trade-in his phone and finance the balance of the price of 
the second phone was clearly set out on the receipt that was provided to Mr C and 
the receipt is consistent with the terms of the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance that he signed in September 2019  theres no mention in either of those 
documents to the first agreement being cancelled or Barclays Partner Finance 
waiving the £540 that was still owed to it;
I sympathise with Mr C for the disappointment and frustration that his 
misunderstanding has caused him  and for the financial and other difficulties that 
hes described  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
supplier or Barclays Partner Finance has acted incorrectly in not cancelling the first 
agreement;
I dont consider that the actions that Barclays Partner Finance has taken about the 
debt thats owed to it under the first agreement have been incorrect or that its acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to cancel the first agreement, to waive or reduce any outstanding amount that Mr C 
owes to it, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
If he hasnt already done so, I suggest that Mr C contacts Barclays Partner Finance to try to 
agree an affordable repayment arrangement for any outstanding amount that he owes to it. 
Its required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes experiencing positively and 
sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2021.
