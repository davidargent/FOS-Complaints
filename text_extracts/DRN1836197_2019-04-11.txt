K820x#14complaint
Mrs M complains about various  accounts  that she has or had with Barclays  Bank Plc but 
does not recognise,  which  she thinks the bank allowed her ex-husband to open fraudulently, 
and about related issues.
background
In 2016, Mrs M had cause  to speak to Barclays about a Barclaycard. At the same time, she 
took the opportunity to ask Barclays what other cards and accounts she held with them.  
They sent her a list, asking her to check it and let them know if anything  was incorrect.  In 
response, she said she did not recognise  most of the accounts, and she believed  they had 
been fraudulently  opened  in her name by her ex-husband, without her knowledge or 
consent. Barclays did not accept that this was the case (although  it did pay her £150 for 
some poor service and to cover the cost of some  subject  access  requests, or SARs,  which  
she had made).
Being dissatisfied with that response, Mrs M brought this complaint to our Service. Part of 
her original complaint  about the Barclaycard was dealt  with separately as a complaint 
against Barclaycard  (as that part of the bank is administered separately from the rest of 
Barclays). I issued  a final decision in that complaint  on 5 March  2019. However, she also 
complains that a member  of staff in a branch  of Barclays confiscated  the Barclaycard, and 
that issue is being dealt with as part of this complaint. Mrs M also complained about her 
online banking facility,  and asked a number of questions  about the accounts. Finally, she 
asked us to reconsider  an old complaint  we had dealt with in 2014.
Our adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. She investigated each account,  and concluded 
that there  was no evidence that any of them had been opened fraudulently.  She could also 
find no evidence of any financial  loss to Mrs M, and some accounts had had no transactions  
on them  at all. Many  accounts had been  closed years ago, and it was likely that Mrs M had 
just forgotten  about them. One account  was not a Barclays account, but was held with a third 
party. Some  of the accounts were joint accounts,  so it was likely that the transactions  Mrs M 
didnt recognise  had been made by the other  joint account holder. Some other payments 
Mrs M didnt  recognise (which she had seen  on her credit file) did not relate to Barclays 
accounts. There was one account  which didnt  exist, and which  appeared to just be a 
reference to another account  where one of the digits had been  entered  incorrectly.  The 
adjudicator thought that Barclays had been  entitled to confiscate  the Barclaycard, as it did 
not belong to Mrs M. She said that Mrs M no longer had an online banking  facility. She 
declined to reconsider the 2014 complaint.
Mrs M did not accept that decision. She asked  for an ombudsman to review her complaint.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
In my final decision in Mrs Ms other  complaint,  I said that the Barclaycard did not belong to 
her. I wont  reconsider that issue here, but will merely adopt that finding for the purposes of 
this decision. Barclays was therefore entitled to confiscate the card from Mrs M, as it was not 
hers.
Ref: DRN18361972In that other final decision I mistakenly said that Mrs M had no Barclaycard accounts. In fact 
she did have one Barclaycard account which I overlooked (because  it was not referred  to in 
that other  complaint), the one with the account  number ending  with 9006. However, all of the 
statements for that account were sent to her current address after the divorce, so I think  she 
must have  known about it. Ive seen no evidence that leads me to think  it is suspicious.
Mrs M does  now recognise two of the Barclays accounts: the joint commercial mortgage in 
2011 for £50,000 (account number  ending 8774), and the joint current account  from which  
the mortgage repayments were  made  (ending  5197). She knows  that the third party  account 
is not a Barclays  account,  she just wants to know which Barclays  account it is linked to. 
Payments were made to that account  in late 2011  from the Barclays  account ending 4904.
That leaves the following  accounts which Mrs M does not recognise:
#Account no.

17 606
18 657

21 UnknownThese are six current accounts listed on a cardholder  protection  policy 
(CPP). Accounts 606 and 657 are not Barclays accounts. 904 is 
certainly the same account as 4904  (account no. 8 above). 059 is a 
joint account, so I think  it must  be the same account  as 6059 (account 
10). The one we dont  have a number for is a Visa Premier  Barclays  
Connect account. (I will refer to these  as the CPP accounts.)
22 EF6219 A share dealing account, open from 1999 to April 2015.
23 KA3117 A share dealing account, opened  in August  2014.
Barclays has no record of any account for Mrs M ending with 4901, and I think this is just a 
typo for 4904.  So I think accounts 7 and 8 on the above list are the same account.
Account 15, ending  9774, has the same sort code and almost the same account  number as 
the £50,000 mortgage account (which ends with 8774 but is otherwise identical). But 
Barclays has no record of it. So I think it is really the mortgage account, with a typo which  
made one digit different,  which  made  it look like another account. (There was also another  
account with the same  account number as the mortgage account, but with a non-existent 
sort code,  which is certainly  a typo for the mortgage  account.)
Ref: DRN18361973For the reasons  I explained in the table above, I think account  16 is the same as account 10, 
and account 19 is the same  as 8. So there are only 19 accounts in the table, not 23, of which 
only 17 are Barclays accounts. (I havent listed the two Barclays  accounts  Mrs M does 
recognise, or the Barclaycard  account,  or the third party account.)
As well as the account numbers I have listed above, Mrs M has mentioned some other 
numbers which she thought were account numbers, but which  the adjudicator has explained 
are not account  numbers  but former online banking and telephone  banking registration 
numbers (ending  9306 and 8445  respectively). I have verified that that is correct.  Her online 
banking and telephone banking have been deactivated.
The user ID number beginning  with H belongs to the member of Barclays staff who printed 
the document on which Mrs M saw it. It does not relate to Mrs M.
Mrs M told our adjudicator that during the marriage she had left all financial matters to her 
husband. I think this explains  why she does not remember  the joint accounts they had with 
Barclays. He would  have  opened the accounts,  after asking her to sign the application forms 
(where applicable),  and after that she did not use them. Most of these accounts were closed 
in 2013 or earlier,  so I think she just forgot  about them. Account 5592 was never used, so 
I cant see why her ex-husband  would have wanted to fraudulently open that account in both 
their names, without her knowledge or consent,  only to not use it. Ive seen no evidence  that 
any of the accounts  were  opened or used improperly.
Mrs M has complained about her name  being removed from the joint accounts.  But she has 
also told us that when she was divorced, the court  ordered that her ex-husband should 
thereafter be solely liable for a number of joint accounts and joint loans. Complying with that 
order would  therefore  have involved removing Mrs M from the relevant accounts, so I cant  
fault the bank  for doing that. This also suggests  that the court knew about those accounts, 
contrary to her assertion  that the court  was only aware of one of them  (the £50,000  
mortgage).
I dont agree that there is anything suspicious about the opening of the joint accounts. Mr M 
ran a business, which was structured as a partnership with Mrs M. She insists  that she didnt 
know she was a partner,  and that she thought she was an employee. I dont disbelieve  her, 
but if she thinks there was any impropriety involved then that is a matter which she should  
have raised in the divorce proceedings. Its not something I would expect the bank to have 
been aware of, since she signed the necessary forms and she co-owned the business 
premises. The commercial mortgage  was secured on those premises, and she knew it was 
in their joint names (or in the name  of the partnership), and she knew  she was liable for it. 
I see no basis for inferring that there was anything untoward about the other joint accounts  
either.
Some of the accounts  have  never been  joint accounts, and have been  held solely in Mrs Ms 
name. She has complained to Barclays about  the 4904 account twice before (once about a 
standing order in 2004, and again  about a transfer in 2011).  This account was used all the 
time for normal, day to day purchases.  Shes  had it for 25 years. I cant  tell why she didnt 
recognise it. She says that some of the purchases  made from that account between  2012 
and 2016 are suspicious and she denies making them,  but I have seen no evidence  to 
support that. I think its more likely  that shes just forgotten them.  I cant see how her ex-
husband could  have had access to the account  after the divorce  in 2013.
Ref: DRN18361974Some accounts were closed ten or more years  ago. I would not expect a bank to retain  
records of closed accounts for longer  than six years, so it has not been  possible to provide 
Mrs M with as much information as she would like to have about these accounts.
I have not been able to find any record of the 1107 mortgage account,  and neither  has 
Barclays. This account is only mentioned in an entry on Mrs Ms credit  file, in which  the first 
fourteen digits are withheld. Since  that is enough concealed digits for a sort code and an 
eight-digit account number, its possible that this is actually one of the other mortgage 
accounts, with its account  number followed by a four-digit reference  number, 1107. Our 
adjudicator thought it was the 0138  account, which was opened in the same month, March 
2005. That is probably right, since I can see no other evidence  that this is a separate  
mortgage.
There are two CPP accounts which I have  been  unable to identify: the 907 account and the 
Premier account. According  to CCP, both accounts  were in Mrs Ms name.  Its possible that 
CPP may be able to provide Mrs M with more information. However, these  accounts  are now 
closed, since they do not appear  on a list of the open accounts which Mrs M still had with 
Barclays in December 2017.1 I have seen no evidence which  leads me to think  that Mrs M 
has been the victim of fraud in relation to either  of those accounts  or any of her other 
Barclays accounts either. I think that £150 is fair compensation for the matters for which  it 
was paid. I therefore see no grounds on which to uphold  this complaint.
Mrs M has asked  how the 6059  account  could have had two closing balances (because she 
saw a document which she read as saying  she had been paid two different closing balances  
for the same account).  I have seen the statements for that account, and there was only one 
closing balance, which was paid to her in two instalments: one of £5,000,  and one for what  
was left.
Mrs M has complained about a document which refers  to an account  opening  date in the 
year 2382,  which  she says is ridiculous. I would draw her attention to the sentence 
immediately to the right of that date, which reads THE INFORMATION IN THIS FIELD  IS 
NOT USED  AND  IS TEMPORARILY  INACCURATE.  I think  that is a sufficient explanation.
I will not reconsider the complaint which this Service dealt with in 2014.  That matter  is closed 
and there  is no good reason to re-open it now.
my final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 May 2019.

1 The only personal accounts in Mrs Ms name which were  still open in December 2017 were  0138 
(the joint mortgage on the marital home), 8195 (the joint mortgage current account) and 9006 (her 
own Barclaycard). She no longer has any business accounts.
