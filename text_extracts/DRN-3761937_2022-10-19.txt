The complaint
Mr F is unhappy that PayrNet Limited introduced monthly charges on his account without
notifying him in advance.
What happened
Mr F applied for a PayrNet account in 2017 which was advertised as having no monthly fees.
However, Mr F noticed that PayrNet had begun charging fees of £1 per month in 2019 and
had raised this to £2 per month in 2020. Mr F wasnt happy about this, especially as he
hadnt been notified by PayrNet that monthly fees would be charged on his account. So, he
raised a complaint.
PayrNet looked at Mr Fs complaint. But they felt that they had notified Mr F in advance that
fees would be applied to his account, and also that the monthly fees would be increased.
And so, they didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F wasnt satisfied with PayrNets response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayrNet hadnt been able to
reasonably confirm that Mr F had been notified that fees would be introduced on his account,
and so they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mr Fs favour and that PayrNet
should reimburse the charged monthly fees to him.
PayrNet didnt respond to the view of the complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 29 September 2022 as follows:
In response to the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, PayrNet 
have provided evidence to this service, in the form of screenshots of their internal 
systems, which Im satisfied does show that Mr F was in all likelihood sent 
communications by PayrNet which gave advance notice to Mr F that the monthly 
account fees would be increased from £1 to £2 per month. And while PayrNet no 
longer retain the records which demonstrate that similar advance notice was sent to 
Mr F in regard to monthly fees of £1 being introduced onto his account in 2019, I feel 
its more likely than not that such notice was sent.
I also feel that Mr F, as the account holder, had a responsibility to monitor his 
account on a regular basis, and I note that the monthly statements for his account 
included that monthly fees were being charged from 2019 onwards. As such, if Mr F 
wasnt happy with the monthly fees being charged on his account, I feel that it was 
incumbent on him to have taken any action he felt necessary sooner, and before the 
fees had been charged to his account for such a lengthy period of time. And in 
consideration of these points, my provisional decision here will be that I wont be 
upholding this aspect of Mr Fs complaint.
However, it seems clear from the correspondence between Mr F and PayrNet 
surrounding Mr Fs inquiries into the fees on his account, that Mr F didnt receive the 
standard of service from PayrNet that he was entitled to receive. This included Mr F 
being incorrectly told by PayrNet that his account had always been a fee-paying 
account, which wasnt the case, as well as several other instances of poor 
communication from PayrNet which it seems clear to me did cause Mr F an 
unnecessary degree of frustration and inconvenience.
As such, my provisional decision here is that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr Fs 
favour on this basis and instructing PayrNet to make a payment of £75 to Mr F, which 
I feel fairly compensates him for the upset and trouble that hes incurred here.
Both Mr F and PayrNet responded to my provisional decision and confirmed that they were 
happy to accept it. As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this 
complaint in Mr Fs favour on the basis explained above. And I can confirm that I do uphold 
this complaint in Mr Fs favour on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
PayrNet must make a payment of £75 to Mr F
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayrNet Limited on the basis 
explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2022.
