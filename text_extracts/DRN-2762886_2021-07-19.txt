The complaint
L, a limited company complains that WorldPay (UK) Limiteds poor levels of customer 
service meant it couldnt take payments for longer than was necessary.
L wants WorldPay to write off the outstanding balance that it has asked L to pay.
What happened
L offers customers online services and used WorldPays merchant payment services.
On 17 March 2020, WorldPay contacted L to say that it had detected a potentially high-risk 
transaction. WorldPay asked L to provide a test login, which it did soon after.
L says that it tried to speak to WorldPay to find out what was happening but couldnt get 
through. And L says WorldPay ignored its emails.
L has clarified that it doesnt want WorldPay to reimburse it for the costs it incurred when it 
couldnt accept payments. But L would like WorldPay to write off the outstanding balance on 
its account of just over Â£700.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ls complaint be upheld. He was satisfied that 
WorldPay could terminate Ls account. The investigator thought it was reasonable of 
WorldPay to investigate the matter before it closed Ls account. 
He didnt consider WorldPay delayed too long before telling L that it was going to close the 
account. So, the investigator didnt consider it was unreasonable of WorldPay to ask L to pay 
the arrears on its account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the problems that L encountered. But my role is to decide whether 
WorldPay made a mistake, and if so, whether it should be required to put things right for L.
WorldPay sent L an email on 17 March 2020 in which it referred to detecting a potentially 
high-risk transaction. It followed this with a letter explaining that WorldPay was investigating 
the transactions. And that L should provide further information to help with is investigation.
L asked for an update on 20 March 2020. This was only a few days after it had supplied the 
requested information. WorldPay then served a termination notice on L by email on 24 
March 2020.
The terms of Ls account allow WorldPay to terminate immediately in certain circumstances, 
such as when there are an excessive number of chargebacks. L says it thought WorldPay 
had sent the termination notice by mistake as it had rarely received chargebacks in the past. 
But Im satisfied that WorldPay clearly explained to L why it was terminating the account in 
line with its terms.
I understand that L would have preferred to hear more quickly from WorldPay. But I dont 
consider taking under a week to conclude its investigation was an unreasonable timescale 
on the part of WorldPay. 
I appreciate that L found the experience stressful, particularly with the additional pressures 
brought on by the pandemic. But overall, I dont consider WorldPay has acted unreasonably 
or made a mistake. 
As far as I can see, L owes money as a result of the chargebacks. This means I dont require 
WorldPay to write-off all or part of Ls debt. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
