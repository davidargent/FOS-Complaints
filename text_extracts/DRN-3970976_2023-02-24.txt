Complaint
Miss E has complained about loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) 
provided to her. She says these loans were provided when she was in financial hardship.
Background
118 118 Money provided Miss E with a first loan for £1,000.00 in October 2016. This loan 
was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of £79.78 but was settled in full in May 2017 
with some of the proceeds from loan 2. Loan 2 was for £2,464.92. £864.92 went towards 
settling the outstanding balance on loan 1 and £1,600.00 were advanced as additional funds 
to Miss E. This loan also had a 24-month term but had monthly repayments of £190.
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Miss E and 118 118 Money had told us. And she 
thought that 118 118 Money hadnt done anything wrong or treated Miss E unfairly. So she 
didnt recommend that Miss Es complaint be upheld. 
Miss E disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at his complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Miss Es complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Ive not been persuaded to uphold Miss Es 
complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Miss E could afford to repay before providing this loan. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money provided Miss E with loans for £1,000.00 and £2,464.92 in October 2012 
and May 2017. These loans were due to be repaid in 24 instalments of £79.78 and £190 
respectively. 
118 118 Money says it agreed to Miss Es applications after she provided details of her 
monthly income and some information on her expenditure. It says it cross-checked this 
against information on a credit search it carried out and all of this information showed Miss E 
could to comfortably make the repayments she was committing to. On the other hand, Miss 
E has said this wasnt a true reflection of the financial hardship she was going through.
Ive carefully thought about what Miss E and 118 118 Money have said. 
The first thing for me to say is that 118 118 Money has provided a record of the results of its 
credit searches. 118 118 Money searches appear to show that Miss E had had some 
previous difficulties repaying credit. But her defaulted accounts had been satisfied. 
Furthermore, Miss Es indebtedness didnt really increase in the period between loans 1 and 
2. Ive also kept in mind that loan 2 wasnt for too much more than was advanced for loan 1. 
So it wasnt immediately obvious that Miss E might have been taking loan 2 because of the 
effect loan 1 left on her finances. And even if loan 2 ran to term this would have left Miss E 
owing 118 118 Money for just over two and a half years, in circumstances where her initial 
loan had a two-year term. So its difficult for me to say that loan 2 had the effect of unfairly 
prolonging Miss Es indebtedness either. 
I accept that Miss Es actual circumstances may not have been fully reflected either in the 
information she provided, or the other information 118 118 Money obtained. Equally I accept 
that if 118 118 Money had gone into the depth of checks Miss E appears to be saying it 
should have  such as obtaining bank statements in the same way a mortgage provider 
would  it may have reached a different answer, although weve not been provided with clear 
evidence this was the case. 
But the key here is that 118 118 Money wasnt providing Miss E with a mortgage. It was 
providing loans for relatively small sums over relatively short terms  albeit at high rates of 
interest. Its only fair and reasonable for me to uphold a complaint in circumstances where a 
lender did something wrong. Given the circumstances here, and the lack of obvious 
inconsistencies, I dont think that reasonable and proportionate checks would have extended 
into the level of checks Miss E is suggesting. 
As this is the case, I dont think that 118 118 Money did anything wrong when deciding to 
lend to Miss E - it carried out proportionate checks and reasonably relied on what it found 
out which suggested the repayments were affordable. And the second loan was provided in 
circumstances where Miss Es indebtedness, at least to it, didnt appear to be increasing 
unsustainably. Furthermore, Ive not been provided with anything which clearly shows me 
that either of the loans were unaffordable either.
So overall I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Miss E unfairly or unreasonably when 
providing her with her loans. And Im not upholding Miss Es complaint. I appreciate this will 
be very disappointing for Miss E. But I hope shell understand the reasons for my decision 
and that shell at least feel her concerns have been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Miss Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 March 2023.
