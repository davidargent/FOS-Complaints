K820x#14complaint
Mrs F says Lloyds  Bank plc mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.  
background
Mrs F bought the policy in 2002 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs F disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Fs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Fs complaint  because:
I think Lloyds made  Mrs F aware that the PPI was optional  and that she chose to 
take it. I say this because the relevant box on the credit card application form was 
ticked to say that Mrs F wanted  the cover. There was another box next to the one 
that was ticked that couldve  been  completed if Mrs F didnt want the PPI.
Lloyds recommended the PPI to Mrs F, but it doesnt look as if it was unsuitable  for 
her based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. Even  though she says 
she would have  received statutory sick pay, the policy  would have paid out in 
addition to that pay, and would have been helpful if she couldnt work. And it would 
have meant she didnt have to rely on her partner and family.
Its possible the information Lloyds gave Mrs F about  the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
should have been.  But its unlikely Mrs F would  have been affected  by any of the 
main things  the policy didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped her buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 May 2019.
