K821x#15complaint
This is a complaint  that Financial Insurance Company Limited  (FICL) mis-sold payment  
protection insurance (PPI) to Miss R. FICL didnt actually sell the policy,  but it has taken 
responsibility for the sale. So Ill refer to it as the seller. 
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy  taken  out in 2000 alongside a store credit account. 
Miss R was sold the policy at the same time that she applied for the account.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint be upheld.  FICL didnt say whether it 
agreed with the adjudicators opinion, so the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  this case.  
Ive decided to uphold Miss Rs complaint. This is because the evidence is that Miss R was 
working part-time when she was sold the PPI. This meant she wasnt eligible for the policy 
and so couldnt benefit from it. 
I think Miss R has lost out as a result. 
fair compensation
Financial Insurance  Company Limited should  put Miss R in the financial position shed be in 
now if she hadnt taken  out PPI.
A.FICL should find out how much  Miss R would have owed when she closed her credit  
account if the policy hadnt  been  added.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added  to those charges. 
FICL should then refund  the difference between what  Miss R owed when she closed her 
account and what  she would have owed if she hadnt had PPI.
If Miss R made a successful  claim  under  the PPI policy, FICL  can take off what  she got 
for the claim from the amount it owes her.  
B.FICL should add simple interest on the difference between what Miss R would have 
owed when she closed her account,  from when  she closed it until she gets the refund. 
The interest rate should  be 8% a year.
C.If  when  FICL works out what Miss R would  have owed each month without  PPI  
Miss R paid more  than enough  to clear her balance, FICL should  also pay simple 
Ref: DRN07537102interest on the extra Miss R paid.  And it should carry on paying interest until the point 
when Miss R wouldve  owed FICL  something on her credit.  The interest rate should  be 
8% a year.
D.FICL should tell Miss R what  its done to work out A, B and C.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires FICL to take off tax from this interest. FICL must give 
Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If the lender has already repaid any commission amount to Miss R that relates  to this PPI 
sale, that sum can be deducted by FICL  from the redress shown above.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im upholding Miss Rs complaint. I require Financial 
Insurance Company Limited  to pay compensation as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 February  2019.
