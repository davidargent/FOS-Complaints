K821x#15complaint
Mr B and Mrs L complain about the service received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) in connection  with their buy to let mortgage application. Theyre also unhappy with 
fees they were  charged. 
background
In July 2018 Mr B and Mrs L were looking to buy a property with the intention  of letting it. 
Mr B searched for buy to let mortgages  online  and found a product he thought  would suit 
their needs  on a comparison website.
Mr B said he was under the impression this product had no arrangement  fee because  it 
wasnt specified on the comparison website. When he clicked on the link for this mortgage,  it 
provided him with NatWests contact number. 
Mr B went  through a full application  with a NatWest mortgage advisor,  only to find there  was 
a £995 arrangement fee. At that point he says hed spent the best part of a day arranging all 
of the documents that needed to be uploaded onto NatWests system  in advance. And hed 
spent almost two and a half hours going  through the application.  So he felt he had no 
alternative but to accept  the mortgage and pay the fee given that he didnt want  to delay the 
house purchase.
Mr B wants  to understand the relationship NatWest has with the comparison website. He 
says NatWest should be responsible for whats advertised on it. He has also asked us to 
conduct a full investigation into the quality of the mortgage documents  and confirm that no 
further mistakes have been made.
Mr B also complained that he chased  NatWest for updates on the mortgage application on 
several occasions and received no response. This delayed  the survey  by a month and as a 
consequence, the overall purchase. 
NatWest didnt uphold  Mr Bs complaint. It said its website makes it clear  that a £995 fee 
applied to the mortgage in question and that its mortgage advisor made the fees clear.  
However NatWest accepted that the service Mr B received  wasnt  what  he deserved and 
apologised for that. 
Mr B wasnt  satisfied with this response so he brought  his complaint to this service. Our 
investigator reviewed the complaint and concluded  that NatWest  was entitled to charge the 
£995 fee as it applied  to the relevant mortgage and because  NatWest told Mr B about it 
before he accepted the mortgage. However, our investigator said that the service  Mr B 
received wasnt what  she would expect, and that she understood this inconvenienced Mr B. 
She suggested that NatWest pay Mr B £150 compensation for this. 
NatWest agreed to pay the £150  compensation, and Mr B said he was happy to accept that 
amount for the customer service received. But he still didnt think  NatWest  shouldve 
charged the arrangement fee. So he asked  for his complaint to be reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN21200082I understand Mr Bs position and I can see that he feels  strongly  about  this matter. But I think  
the £150 compensation our investigator  recommended is appropriate. Ill explain why.
Mr B has raised a number  of questions about  NatWests relationship  with the comparison 
website. He told us he felt deceived about  the £995  fee and that NatWest should  be 
accountable for the third parties they engage  with to advertise  their products.
I appreciate that Mr B feels that way. But the Financial Ombudsman Service  is an informal 
dispute resolution service.  It isnt a regulator. So it isnt for us to investigate the commercial 
relationship between the two businesses or to audit the relevant mortgage documentation. 
My role is to form a view about  the central  issues in this complaint, and resolve it in a way 
thats fair and reasonable. 
I appreciate that Mr B was frustrated to hear about  the £995  arrangement  fee given that he 
says there  was no fee mentioned on the comparison website.  I understand that hed spent 
time getting his documentation together and speaking to NatWest  before he was told about 
the fee. However, he wouldve had to spend  time getting his paperwork together when  
making an application to any lender.
NatWest made it clear on its website that a £995 fee was applicable to the relevant 
mortgage product,  and NatWest says the mortgage adviser Mr B spoke to told Mr B about 
the fee. I can also see that the fee was set out in the mortgage agreement. So Im satisfied 
that NatWest was entitled to charge the £995 fee, and that it was open to Mr B to decide not 
to get the mortgage once he realised there was a fee. In the circumstances, I dont think it 
would be fair and reasonable for me to require NatWest to reimburse him for the fee as he 
has suggested.
NatWest accepts that it caused delay and didnt provide the level of service Mr B could 
expect. Although the various mistakes  havent  had a financial impact on Mr B, I recognise  
how frustrating it mustve  been for him to have to chase NatWest for updates. NatWest has 
agreed to the £150 suggested  by the investigator, and Mr B has indicated  that hes happy 
with this. I also think its a fair and reasonable amount of compensation to reflect the distress  
and inconvenience  this caused given  the amount of time Mr B was affected.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should  pay Mr B and Mrs L £150 to 
resolve this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B and Mrs L to 
accept or reject my decision  before  13 June  2019.
