The complaint
Mr P complains that PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender) irresponsibly gave him 
loans which he couldnt afford to pay back.

Mr P said that his Mr Lender loans caused him problems and led to him having to borrow 
more money to pay the loans hed taken out. Mr P told us this affected his mental health.
When Mr P complained to Mr Lender, it made him an offer to try and resolve his complaint. 
Mr Lender said it would refund the interest hed paid on loans 7 and 8. Mr P didnt feel this 
offer went far enough overall to deal with his complaint so he asked us to investigate.
Our adjudicator felt it wasnt unfair for Mr Lender to have provided loans 1-3 and loans 912.  
But she said the repayments for loan 4 represented a significant proportion of Mr Ps 
income. So there was a significant risk that Mr P wouldnt have been able to make the 
repayment on loan 4 without having to borrow again  making the loan unsustainable for 
him. So she felt that Mr Lender shouldnt have provided loan 4 to Mr P, or any further loans 
in that lending chain  up to and including loan 8.
 
Mr Lender disagreed with our adjudicator but asked our adjudicator to pass on an offer to 
Mr P. It said it would be willing to take the steps wed expect a lender to carry out to put 
things right in relation to loans 6-8.
Mr P didnt accept this offer and hes asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint and 
make a final decision.
Mr Lender said that Mr Ps fourth loan was approved more than seven months after he 
repaid his previous loan and therefore this would constitute a new chain of borrowing. It says 
this shows there was less of a significant risk Mr P would struggle to repay his priority bills 
and would mean less checks would be carried out in proportion to being a new loan within 
this loan chain.
And Mr Lender also said that prior to approving loan 4 the results of the expenditure 
assessment it did showed that even after the highest repayment Mr P was still left with a 
sufficient disposable income for any future unforeseen expenses.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure.
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr Lender was required to establish whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
So it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
consumer wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. 
Mr Lender has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr P. It asked him for details 
of his income and normal expenditure. And Mr Lender carried out checks on Mr Ps credit 
file.
Looking at each of the loans in turn, I agree with the adjudicator that on the basis of the 
information Mr P told Mr Lender about his income and outgoings and what Mr Lender had 
recorded about his financial situation, it wasnt wrong for Mr Lender to give him loans 1, 2 
and 3. It was early in the lending relationship and given the loan amounts and the 
information Mr Lender had recorded for Mr P, I think the checks were enough for Mr Lender 
to agree to lend. As Mr P hasnt raised any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in 
relation to these loans, I dont think that I need to say more about them.
There was a gap in lending of around 7 months between Mr P paying loan 3 and taking out 
loan 4. I think it was fair for Mr Lender to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess 
his lending requests accordingly.
Looking at loan 4, I can see that this Mr Ps biggest loan so far and a substantial loan 
amount. I agree with our adjudicator that, given the particular circumstances of Mr Ps case, 
Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that loan 4 was likely to be unsustainable and it 
shouldnt have provided this loan. 
I say this because when he asked for loan 4, Mr Lenders records show it relied on 
information showing that Mr Ps income was £2,250. When he took out this loan, the total 
repayment he needed to make in 8 days (around £977) worked out as more than 40% of his 
take home pay just for this loan alone.
I think Mr Lender ought to have realised that the repayment Mr P had to make to pay loan 4 
was such a significant proportion of his spending money that month that in reality, despite 
what hed told Mr Lender about his main outgoings, this loan wasnt likely to be sustainably 
affordable for him (whether or not it was the start of a new chain of lending). So Mr Lender shouldnt have provided loan 4 to Mr P. And for these reasons, Im upholding 
Mr Ps complaint about loan 4 and the loans that followed in that chain of borrowing  up to 
and including loans 6-8 which Mr Lender has already offered to uphold. 
Loan 9 was effectively the start of the next chain of lending after another 7 months or so gap 
between loans. And I think it was reasonable for our adjudicator not to uphold that loan. 
I agree there wasnt anything reasonably to make Mr Lender think that this loan wasnt likely 
to be affordable for Mr P.
This turned out to be a one off loan as Mr P didnt borrow again from Mr Lender for another 
9 months or so. 
That gap in lending seems long enough to me for Mr Lender reasonably to think that Mr P 
mightve put his finances in order during this period. This meant that when his borrowing 
started again, and Mr P applied for loan 10, he was effectively starting over again. So it was 
fair for Mr Lender to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess his lending requests 
accordingly
As far as I can see, Mr P is happy to accept what our adjudicator said with respect to not 
upholding his complaint about loans 10-12. So I dont think I need to say more about these 
loans except to say that I agree with our adjudicator about these loans.  
So, this means Im upholding Mr Ps complaint about loans 4-8.
Putting things right
If Mr Lender has sold the outstanding debt it should buy this back before doing what I have 
outlined below. If Mr Lender isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the following:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr P towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr P which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr P originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr P as though they had been 
repayments of the principal. If this results in Mr P having made overpayments then 
these should be refunded with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, 
from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is 
settled. Mr Lender should then refund the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" and 
move to step "E".
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results 
in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mr P. However if there is still an outstanding balance then Mr Lender should try to agree an affordable repayment 
plan with Mr P.
E. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Ps credit file for loans 4-7 and for loan 8 once it 
is repaid  and ask the debt purchaser to do the same if necessary. 
. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partly uphold Mr Ps complaint and direct PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender) to 
put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 December 2020.
