The complaint
Mr C complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
£3,000 that he paid for a holiday club membership.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr C used his Barclaycard credit card in October 2018 to make a payment of £3,000 
towards the purchase price of a holiday club membership. The following day he wrote 
to the holiday company to reject the agreements for the holiday club memberships for 
his wife and himself. His wifes agreement was cancelled and he wrote to the holiday 
company again five days later but his agreement wasnt cancellable.
Mr C then claimed a refund from Barclaycard but it said that it was unable to make 
representations for a refund as the service was available and the contract non-
cancellable. It apologised for the time that it had taken to resolve his claim and for the 
lack of a call-back and it gave him a refund of £50. Mr C wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He 
considered Mr Cs claim under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. He didnt think that the membership was misrepresented to Mr C or that his 
relationship with Barclaycard was unfair. He didnt think that Barclaycard had acted 
unfairly when it decided not to uphold his claims under section 75 and 140A.
Mr C has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has 
responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that hes been 
the victim of a switch fraud as the holiday company switched the payment for a ten 
year membership for another arrangement and that his full signature isnt on any of 
the documents. He says that any such contract would have been cancellable under 
European law and that there are many examples of this switch fraud being used.
I said in my provisional decision: I agree with our investigator that this complaint shouldnt 
be upheld but for these reasons:
Mr C has provided a detailed timeline of the events that he says took place in 
October 2018 and he says that he made a part payment on a ten year club 
membership using his Barclaycard  he says that the agreed amount was to be 
almost 50% of the total agreed cost of £6,250 and the membership would start in 
December 2018;
he says that he and his wife were provided with documents some hours later but he 
was certain that the whole affair was wrong and contrary to European laws so they 
each applied rough and flawed squiggles to those papers;
the documents that are in Mr Cs name include the purchase agreement to which 
hed added what appears to be his signature, a compliance statement that he 
initialled in nine places and then added what appears to be his signature and a 
document headed declaration of treating purchasers fairly, sales practice and 
privacy notice, agreement and consent with yes circled in two places and to which 
hed added what appears to be his signature;
the documents that are in his wifes name include the purchase agreement, terms 
and conditions, an information statement and the standard form withdrawal notice 
that was to be given  to all of which shed added what appears to be her signature;
those documents describe a holiday club membership from December 2018 to 
November 2019 for Mr C with a purchase price of £3,000 which the purchase 
agreement said couldnt be cancelled and a holiday club membership for his wife 
from November 2019 to November 2029 with a purchase price of £3,350 due in 
November 2018  but that agreement was cancelled;
if Mr C and his wife didnt want to be bound by the agreements, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them not to have applied rough and flawed squiggles 
which appeared to be their signatures to the documents and to have discussed their 
concerns with the holiday company at that time;
the payment that was made to the holiday company was for £3,000 and Barclaycard 
says that the card details presented to it for authorisation were correct and the 
transaction was PIN verified  and I consider that it was Mr Cs responsibility to 
ensure that he wanted to make the payment and to confirm the amount of the 
payment before he entered his PIN;
Mr C says that he made a part payment on a ten year club membership but theres 
no documentary evidence from that time to show that he was making such a 
payment  and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect a consumer to have 
received some documentary evidence before agreeing to make a payment of £3,000 
towards the price of a ten year holiday club membership;
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute but theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be 
made;
if the right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules - 
and if theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for 
a chargeback claim to be made;
Im not persuaded that there was a reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim being 
successful in these circumstances because its likely that it would have been 
defended by the holiday company as Mr C had authorised the payment and it had the 
purchase agreements to which he and his wife had added what appeared to be their 
signatures  so I dont consider that Barclaycard acted incorrectly by not making a 
chargeback claim for Mr Cs payment;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Cs complaint about Barclaycards response to his section 75 
claim, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the holiday company and that Barclaycards response to his claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Cs claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the holiday club membership wasnt available to 
Mr C from December 2018 to November 2019 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company in these circumstances;
Ive carefully considered Mr Cs description of the sale process but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was misrepresented to 
him;
our investigator also considered Mr Cs claim under section 140A - section 140A 
gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum 
paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair 
relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Mr C used his Barclaycard credit card to pay £3,000 to the holiday company and it 
would be for a court to decide whether the relationship between Mr C and 
Barclaycard was unfair  but Im not persuaded that its likely that a court would find 
that the relationship was unfair in these circumstances;
the purchase agreement to which Mr C added what appears to be his signature was 
for a membership from December 2018 until November 2019 and Im not persuaded 
that hes provided enough evidence to show that he was entitled to cancel the 
agreement, that the agreement was unlawful or that hes been the victim of a fraud;
Mr C has referred to many examples of this switch fraud being used but this service 
considers each complaint on its individual merits and I dont consider that Mr C has 
provided enough evidence to show that the holiday company has acted incorrectly in 
its dealings with him;
I sympathise with Mr C for the experience that hes described and the loss that hes 
incurred as he paid £3,000 to the holiday company but didnt use any of the 
membership benefits that were available to him under the purchase agreement  but 
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
holiday company or that his relationship with Barclaycard was unfair;
Mr C claimed a refund from Barclaycard and it apologised for the time that it had 
taken to resolve his claim and for the lack of a call-back and it paid him £50 
compensation - I consider that its response to his claim for a refund was fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclaycard to refund to Mr C the £3,000 that he paid to the holiday company, to pay 
him any further compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
Subject to any further representations from Mr C and Barclaycard, my provisional decision 
was that I didnt intend to uphold this complaint. Barclaycard says that it has nothing further 
to add but Mr C has responded to my provisional decision in detail. He has provided a 
description of what he calls the scam, the results of his investigations into the parties 
involved, and a timeline and description of what happened. He says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that:
there are multiple examples of the switch-fraud described on websites which have 
taken place by the same team of crooks for more than twelve years, affecting scores 
of people and similar instances have resulted in cardholders being refunded since 
May 2019;
he made an urgent request from overseas early on the following morning to cancel 
the fraudulent card payment;
the supposed deal covered by the contracts had been manipulated and transposed subsequent to the card payment;
the fraudulent sale process took place in October 2018 and the membership contract 
that he thought hed agreed to sign was due to commence weeks later in December 
2018 and, because EU laws allow cooling off times for such transactions, he believed 
that it would be enough to reach a final decision about participation before the 
contract commenced;
the "one extra year free" deal also commenced in December 2018 but by then a 
whole raft of new restrictive conditions about how it could be used were set out on 
vouchers which had never been shown or mentioned previously and the agreement 
implied that the deal would have ended 363 days later  which was a trick to place 
the supposed holiday club membership scheme beyond EU timeshare regulation  
but the agreement began in October 2018 so it lasted for more than a year;
an extra page had been inserted into the set of papers subsequent to him marking 
them which contained conditions that hed not seen previously;
the payment that he made was towards a ten year worldwide holiday club deal which 
would have been covered by EU timeshare provisions but the one year deal explains 
why his wifes cancellation was accepted so quickly  and this has also been the 
case with the other victim reports that hes seen;
he was deliberately misled and conned into believing a scenario in which club 
membership for 10 years would entitle him and his wife to discounted holidays at 
resorts all over the world but it was misrepresented and he was trapped as he was 
told that his payment now related to something else;
in order to come away with any proof of anything he decided not to use his proper 
and verifiable signature and there is no witness signature on the papers in the space 
provided for one; and
it was a switch-scam to divert money.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I set out in my provisional decision the reasons that I considered that Mr Cs complaint 
shouldnt be upheld. Ive carefully considered the further representations that hes made in 
response to my provisional decision but Im not persuaded that I should change my 
provisional decision.
The purchase agreement to which Mr C added what appeared to be his signature says: The 
Vendor agrees to sell and the Purchaser agrees to buy Membership of [the holiday 
company] upon and subject to the terms and conditions stated below and the Terms and 
Conditions overleaf. It also says: The Purchaser hereby irrevocably agrees by his signature 
below to be bound by the Purchase Agreement Conditions as stated on the reverse of this 
document.
Mr C says that the terms and conditions werent seen by him until later but I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him to have asked to see the terms and conditions before 
adding what appeared to be his signature to the purchase agreement if they hadnt been 
provided to him at that time.
The purchase agreement also says: Subject to signature by the Purchaser, this agreement 
shall be immediately binding and cannot be cancelled  so I dont consider that it was reasonable for Mr C to believe that he had some time to reach a final decision about 
participation before the contract commenced. The completion date of the agreement was in 
October 2018, the membership start date was in December 2018 and the membership end 
date was in November 2019.
Mr C had made a payment to the holiday company for a holiday club membership. He says 
that he believed that it was a part payment on a ten year club membership but theres no 
documentary evidence from that time to show that he was making such a payment  and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect a consumer to have received some 
documentary evidence before agreeing to make a payment of £3,000 towards the price of a 
ten year holiday club membership. 
I dont consider that it was fair or reasonable for Mr C to have added what appeared to be 
his signature to the documents. If he didnt want to be bound by the purchase agreement 
and other documents I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him not to have 
applied what appeared to be his signature to the documents and to have discussed his 
concerns with the holiday company. 
Mr C says that the documents that were produced to him limited any holiday to a single 
resort on two islands which would have included fresh sales pressure and that his later 
investigations have confirmed that one of the resorts would seldom have any suitable 
vacancies  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
membership that was described in the purchase agreement and other documents wasnt 
available to Mr C.
Its clear that Mr C believes very strongly that hes been the innocent victim of a scam but 
Barclaycards liability in these circumstances would be under sections 75 and 140A. Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company or that its likely that a court would consider that 
the relationship between Mr C and Barclaycard was unfair in these circumstances.
I consider that Barclaycards response to Mr Cs claim for a refund was fair and reasonable. I 
sympathise with Mr C for the experience that hes described and the loss that hes incurred 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclaycard to refund to him 
the £3,000 that he paid to the holiday company, to pay him any further compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
 My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
