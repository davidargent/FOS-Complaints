The complaint
Mr H complains Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly provided 
him with two loans.
Mr H is represented by a claims management company, but for ease Ill refer to all 
submissions as though they are his own.
What happened
Mr H was approved with two loans by 118 118 Money. Ive provided the details below:
Loan Date of loan Capital

value
Loan 1 21 September 2018 £1,400 12 £150 (approx.) £1,810 (approx.)
Loan 2 10 April 2020 £2,000 24 £155 (approx.) £3,740 (approx.)
Mr H complained to 118 118 Money in 2022. He said that it had irresponsibly provided him 
with two loans; and that had it completed reasonable and proportionate checks it would have 
identified the loans were unaffordable for him.
118 118 Money issued its final response in July 2022, not upholding Mr Hs complaint. It 
concluded that it had responsibly provided Mr H with both loans. However, it offered £200 in 
relation to loan two as a gesture of goodwill, for any detriment or inconvenience it said Mr H 
had suffered. 
Unhappy with 118 118 Moneys response, Mr H referred his complaint to our service for 
review.
Our investigator considered Mr Hs complaint and didnt uphold it. He said that 118 118 
Money had completed proportionate checks and reached a fair lending decision when 
approving loan one. He went on to say that he didnt think the checks 118 118 Money 
completed for loan two were proportionate. He reviewed the bank statements Mr H provided 
to get an understanding of his financial circumstances around the time of loan two, and 
concluded that loan two appeared affordable and that 118 118 Money would have likely, and 
reasonably, come to the same decision to lend, had it completed proportionate checks.
Mr H didnt agree with our investigators assessment and asked that his complaint be 
reviewed by an ombudsman, so it has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator, for broadly the 
same reasons. I appreciate this will be disappointing to Mr H.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending as 
well as the key rules, regulations and what we consider to be good industry practice on our 
website. Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Hs complaint.   
Bearing in mind the complaint before me, I think that there are a number of overarching 
questions I need to consider in order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Hs complaint. 
These are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr H to satisfy 
itself he was in a position to afford to repay the loans sustainably?
If so, did it make fair decisions?
If not, would those checks have shown Mr H would have been able to do so?
2.Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive gone on to answer these questions for each loan in turn.
Loan one - Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr H to 
satisfy itself he was in a position to afford to repay the loan sustainably? If so, did it make a 
fair lending decision?
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it responsibly lent to Mr H. The 
relevant rules, regulations and guidance at the time 118 118 Money lent required it to carry 
out reasonable and proportionate checks. These checks needed to assess Mr Hs ability to 
afford the loans and repay them sustainably over their terms without causing him financial 
difficulties.
There isnt a set list of checks a lender needs to carry out, but they should be proportionate, 
taking into account things like the type, amount, duration and total cost of the credit, as well 
as Mr Hs individual circumstances. 
And it isnt sufficient for 118 118 Money to just complete proportionate checks  it must also 
consider the information it obtained from these checks to make fair lending decisions. This 
includes not lending to someone in financial hardship; and ensuring repayments can be 
made sustainably without having to borrow further.
118 118 Money appears to have obtained Mr Hs declarations for his income and regular 
expenses. It also completed a credit search and obtained details of Mr Hs credit 
commitments. 
118 118 Money says based on the checks it completed and the details obtained, it 
completed proportionate checks. 
Ive carefully considered 118 118 Moneys argument here, and in the individual 
circumstances Im persuaded the checks it completed were proportionate. 
Mr H declared his income as around £2,180 and his monthly expenses as around £240 
towards rent and £545 towards his other regular commitments. 118 118 Money completed a 
credit check and noted Mr Hs credit commitments to be around £305 per month. This was 
made up of a payment towards a hire purchase account and a number of credit cards and 
mail order accounts. 
118 118 Money concluded that Mr H was left with around £940 after taking into account the 
monthly payment to this loan. The credit check 118 118 Money completed does suggest signs of past financial distress, 
but this is largely historic with most accounts generally having been maintained relatively 
well within the 18 months leading up to this loan. 
Mr H had an active CCJ registered in 2015. And had three defaults on telecommunication 
accounts, however these were all registered in 2015 and 2016; and more than two years 
prior to this application. 
At the point of this lending Mr H had total balances outstanding of around £20,200, with a 
large proportion of this on a hire purchase account taken around eight months prior to this 
loan. Mr H had an available revolving balance of around £1,880 and was utilising a relatively 
low amount of this available credit at this point, around 25%. 
So, based on the terms of the credit being provided, and the information 118 118 Money 
obtained about Mr Hs individual circumstances, I dont consider there was anything it saw 
which ought reasonably to have led to it concluding further checks were warranted; and 
therefore, Im satisfied its checks were proportionate. 
Ive carefully considered the information 118 118 Money obtained as part of its proportionate 
checks, and having done so, Im satisfied in this instance that it went on to make a fair 
lending decision. 
As Ive found above, the value and term of the loan being provided were relatively low. Mr H 
was looking to borrow £1,000 over 12 months, repayable at around £150 per month. The 
information 118 118 Money obtained suggested Mr H had a fairly significant disposable 
income each month, and while there were historic issues with his credit; his recent credit 
history showed he was maintaining his commitments relatively well. 
So, taking all of this into account I dont consider there was anything in the relatively recent 
past which ought to have raised concerns for 118 118 Money; and Im therefore satisfied it 
went on to make a fair lending decision when approving Mr H with loan one.
Loan two - Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr H to 
satisfy itself he was in a position to afford to repay the loan sustainably? If not, would those 
checks have shown Mr H would have been able to do so?
In April 2020 Mr H returned to 118 118 Money for further borrowing. This was within two 
years of obtaining loan one, which had been settled in line with its original term. So, at this 
point 118 118 Money had a history with Mr H which it was able to draw on. It also appears to 
have used the same details as it did at loan one for Mr Hs income and expenditure. And it 
completed a new credit check.
The credit check 118 118 Money completed evidenced that in the near 21-month period 
between loan one and loan two, Mr H had obtained around five new lines of credit. And while 
his total outstanding debt had decreased slightly from loan one by around £2,000, his use of 
revolving credit had increased. Mr Hs revolving credit accounts were all generally being 
utilised to higher levels than had previously been the case at the point of loan one, and this 
had been a consistent pattern across the six months leading up to loan two. Mr H was now 
using 60% of his available revolving credit limits; with his total available revolving credit 
standing at around £4,400, compared to around £1,800 at the point of loan one. 
Mr Hs number of minimum payments to revolving accounts had also increased between the 
two loans; and, Mr H had a couple of missed payments across a number of accounts in the 
six months leading up to loan two, although on the whole he was maintaining his accounts 
relatively well. So, taking all of this information into account, I think there were signs that Mr Hs financial 
position had changed since 118 118 Money had approved loan one. He had opened more 
credit accounts and had a higher amount of revolving credit available to him, which he was 
increasingly using. This, together with the recent missed payments could suggest Mr H was 
starting to show signs that he wasnt managing his finances well. 
I consider at this point proportionate checks would have included 118 118 Money obtaining a 
full understanding of Mr Hs financial circumstances, by verifying his income and regular 
expenses, as well as completing the credit check it obtained, in order to ensure this loan 
would be sustainably affordable to him across the full term. So, I dont consider proportionate 
checks were completed in this instance.
Mr H has provided our service with bank statements covering a period before and after the 
approval of loan two. 118 118 Money could have verified Mr Hs expenditure via a number of 
means, but in the absence of any other information, Ive considered Mr Hs statements from 
three months prior to the loan being approved. Ive used three months statements as I 
consider this would have been a proportionate period of time for 118 118 Moneys checks to 
have taken account of, in order to have understood Mr Hs financial circumstances around 
the time of loan two. 
The statements show Mr Hs average income as around £2,260 per month. His regular 
monthly expenses total around £1,100. This is made up of what appears to be a rent 
payment of £500, around £280 to Mr Hs hire purchase agreement, around £120 towards an 
insurance policy and around £200 towards utilities and subscriptions. 
Mr H was therefore left with over £1,100 per month to cover payments towards his revolving 
credit facilities and discretionary expenditure. I can see that across the three months Mr H 
made payments totalling on average around £420 toward his credit accounts, which largely 
corresponds with the information 118 118 Money saw within the credit file it obtained. This 
suggests Mr H would be left with around £600 disposable income per month after taking into 
account repayment to this loan.  
So, Im persuaded had 118 118 Money completed proportionate checks at loan two it would 
likely have identified Mr H would have been left with a reasonable level of disposable income 
after taking into account all of his regular expenses and credit commitments; and therefore, 
have reasonably concluded this loan was sustainably affordable to Mr H across its term. 
Im therefore satisfied that had 118 118 Money completed proportionate checks it would still 
have reasonably reached the same fair decision to provide loan two. 
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive not seen any evidence to suggest 118 118 Money acted unfairly or unreasonably in any 
other way.
Taking all of the above into account, Im satisfied 118 118 Money made fair lending 
decisions when approving both loans; and it therefore follows I dont require it to take any 
further action in resolution of Mr Hs complaint. 
118 118 Money has confirmed that the outstanding debt had been sold to a third-party debt 
collection company. As such Mr H will need to liaise with this company to discuss repayment 
of the debt.
118 118 Money made an offer within its final response to settle this complaint. Mr H should contact 118 118 Money directly to discuss this offer, if he now wishes to.
My final decision
My final decision is that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money doesnt need to 
do anything to settle this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
