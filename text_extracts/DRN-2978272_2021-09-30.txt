The complaint
Mrs B and Mr T are unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc turned down their application 
for a mortgage on the basis it was unaffordable for them.
What happened
Mrs B and Mr T applied for a mortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) in 
mid-August 2020. NatWest initially confirmed the mortgage was approved subject to 
valuation. But a couple of days later NatWest told them their application had been declined 
on the basis their income was insufficient.
Mrs B and Mr T say they were upset and confused by what had happened and asked 
NatWest for an explanation. NatWest said the accounts for Mr Ts business showed losses 
over recent years. Mrs B and Mr T said the accounts showed the business was in profit. 
Mr T spoke to an underwriter to discuss things but felt he wasnt given a proper opportunity 
to explain.
NatWest cancelled the valuation of the property Mrs B and Mr T were planning to buy. Mrs B 
and Mr T felt this damaged their reputation with those involved in the purchase. And, 
although they managed to get a mortgage offer from another lender soon afterwards, they 
wanted an explanation from NatWest about why their application had been declined as well 
as compensation for the stress theyd suffered.
In responding to Mrs B and Mr Ts complaint, NatWest apologised for the confusion theyd 
caused by telling Mrs B and Mr T, before an underwriting decision had been made, that their 
application had been accepted and then withdrawing it. And they paid Mrs B and Mr T £300 
compensation.  
But Mrs B and Mr T werent happy their complaint had been resolved so they brought it to 
this service. They wanted NatWest to acknowledge theyd made a mistake in assessing the 
profitably of Mr Ts business. 
Our investigator felt NatWest hadnt clearly explained why they declined Mrs B and Mr Ts 
application. But he thought NatWests apology and offer of compensation of £300 was 
enough to put things right. Since Mrs B and Mr T didnt accept our investigators view, their 
complaints been referred to me for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge Mrs B and Mr Ts strength of feeling about whats happened. But, for the 
reasons Ill explain, I think NatWest have done enough to address their complaint and put 
things right.
Mrs B and Mr T are concerned NatWest came to the wrong conclusion about the profitability 
of Mr Ts business and argue the accounts they provided showed his business was making a 
profit. NatWest have since explained they were concerned - based on their understanding of 
the information they considered - about how easy it would be to convert the businesss 
assets into cash without a loss in value. 
Whilst I accept this explanation may not satisfy Mrs B and Mr T, NatWest were obliged under 
the relevant rules to check the mortgage was affordable for Mrs B and Mr T. And they were 
entitled to come to a business decision about whether to lend to them bearing in mind their 
lending criteria and risk appetite at the time. So, I wont ask NatWest to say they made a 
mistake.
I agree though that NatWest were wrong to tell Mrs B and Mr T their application had been 
accepted before theyd come to the end of their underwriting process. 
Mrs B and Mr T have explained they spent a lot of time trying to communicate with NatWest 
to resolve their misunderstanding of the accounts and ultimately had to apply to another 
lender. They say they suffered stress and lack of sleep. They feel their reputation with the 
other parties involved in the purchase was damaged as it looked like theyd had 
overstretched themselves financially. And they say came very close to losing the house of 
their dreams.
NatWest acknowledged they should have done better here. They apologised to Mrs B and 
Mr T and paid them compensation of £300. I can understand Mrs B and Mr T would have 
been worried they werent going to be able to buy the property and it would have been 
embarrassing for them when the valuation didnt take place. Fortunately, they were able to 
get another offer quite quickly and go ahead. 
Bearing everything in mind, I think NatWests apology and compensation payment was a fair 
and reasonable way of resolving Mrs B and Mr Ts complaint. So, I dont uphold their 
complaint to this service. 
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mrs B and Mr Ts 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr T to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
