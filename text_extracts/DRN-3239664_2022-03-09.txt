The complaint
Mr M complains about the adverse information that BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited, 
trading as Alphera Financial Services, has recorded on his credit file about missed payments 
under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with Alphera Financial 
Services that he signed in April 2018. He agreed to make 48 monthly payments of £518.74 
for the car to be supplied to him and there was an optional final repayment of £15,213.94. 
Mr M didnt make all of those payments and Alphera Financial Services recorded adverse 
information on his credit file.  
Mr M complained to Alphera Financial Services about that but it said that it had sent multiple 
letters, including settlement figures and arrears letters which confirmed the amount 
outstanding, and that the outstanding amount remained payable in full. Mr M wasnt satisfied 
with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that there 
was some confusion over the missed payments and that it would have been helpful if 
Alphera Financial Services had given Mr M more information  but she also said that there 
were no reasonable grounds to ask it to remove any adverse information from his credit file 
in relation to the missed payments in April and November 2020 because it must report 
accurate information to the credit reference agencies. 
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman. He says, in 
summary, that the crux of this whole matter is his call to Alphera Financial Services in May 
2021 when it couldnt confirm specifically what the situation was with his account and hed 
have corrected it if hed been in any way responsible for the situation but it was entirely of its 
own making and he did everything he felt he could to address those matters. He says that 
Alphera Financial Services negligence, lack of transparency and overall unresponsiveness 
has led to him being unfairly treated and has unjustly compromised the integrity of his credit 
file.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr M had agreed to make monthly payments of £518.74 to Alphera Financial 
Services for the car to be supplied to him;
Alphera Financial Services has provided an account statement which shows that 
there were frequent issues with Mr Ms monthly payment not being made by the 
payment date;
the payment due from him in April 2020 wasnt made and Alphera Financial Services 
sent him arrears letters about that missed payment;
Mr M says that he didnt receive those letters but I consider it to be more likely than 
not that those letters were sent to him, even if he didnt receive them;
Alphera Financial Services also issued a settlement letter in October 2020 which 
showed that the account was a payment in arrears;
the payment due from Mr M in November 2020 also wasnt made and Alphera 
Financial Services records show that it tried to contact him about the missed 
payment and left a message for him to call it;
Mr M made an extra payment of £518.74 to Alphera Financial Services in January 
2021 but it issued another settlement letter which showed that his account was two 
payments in arrears;
Alphera Financial Services made further attempts to contact Mr M about the arrears 
on his account until Mr M phoned it in May 2021  I consider that it could have more 
clearly explained his payment history and the arrears on his account to Mr M at that 
time  but I also consider that he ought to have known that his account was in 
arrears and he could have paid the arrears at that time;
it was Mr Ms responsibility to make the agreed payments to Alphera Financial 
Services and he could have checked with his bank which payments had been made 
from his account;
Alphera Financial Services issued a default notice to Mr M in October 2021 and he 
made the payment required to clear the arrears on his account  but its recorded 
adverse information about his payments on his credit file;
Alphera Financial Services is required to record true and accurate information about 
Mr Ms payment history on his credit file  and I consider that the information that its 
recorded on his credit file is a true and accurate record of his payment history;
Mr M clearly feels that this situation was caused by Alphera Financial Services  but 
Im not persuaded that any failure by Alphera Financial Services during the May 2021 
phone call to properly explain the situation with Mr Ms account to him justifies me 
requiring it to take any action in response to Mr Ms complaint; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Alphera Financial Services to remove or amend any of the adverse information that 
its recorded on Mr Ms credit file, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
