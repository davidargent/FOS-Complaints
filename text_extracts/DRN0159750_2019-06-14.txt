K821x#15complaint
Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr G had six loans with CEN. Ive set out some of the information CEN provided  about the 
loans in a table at the end of this decision.  
CEN made an initial offer to refund the interest  and charges for loans 3 and 5. Our 
adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought loans 2 to 6 had not been lent responsibly.
CEN agreed  to refund the interest  and charges  for loans 2 to 5, but didnt agree to a refund 
for loan 6. Mr G didnt accept CENs offer, so the case was passed  to me to decide.
As loan 6 is the only loan still in dispute, my decision will focus on this loan.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Our adjudicator thought that loan 6, the FlexCredit agreement, was not lent responsibly 
primarily because Mr G had been borrowing for around 17 months  and appeared to be 
dependent on high-cost  credit  including still having  an overlapping instalment loan (loan 4) 
with CEN  at the time.
CEN didnt  agree that the amount  of time Mr G had been borrowing meant loan 6 was 
unsustainable  although it hasnt clearly  explained  why it doesnt think  this was the case.
I dont agree with CEN that the pattern of lending didnt, in Mr Gs case,  point strongly 
towards the lending  having become unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  By the time of loan 
6, Mr G had been  borrowing from CEN  for around 17 months, without break. He was then 
asking to borrow again just two days after settling  his fifth loan  and was asking for a 
different type of loan which would likely extend his indebtedness for a significant period of 
time.
Ive also seen that Mr G continued to rely heavily on other short-term lenders too  
something CEN was likely aware  of, as it says it carried out credit checks. If it wasnt  aware,  
it ought to have been, as the result  of carrying out proportionate affordability checks.
So CEN ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having to borrow  further 
as a result  of being dependent on high-cost  short-term credit  and that repaying his loans was 
leaving a regular hole in his finances, causing  him to have to borrow  again. All of this means 
CEN shouldve realised his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I therefore think CEN continued  to lend to Mr G after it ought  to have realised the lending 
was unsustainable.  And it unfairly prolonged his indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
Ref: DRN01597502Im therefore  upholding the complaint  about loan 6, in addition to those CEN  has already 
agreed to uphold.
putting things right
CEN must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2 to 5, as it has offered
refund  the interest and charges Mr G paid on loan 6
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr G paid them (if he 
did) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 2 to 5 from Mr Gs credit  history and 
remove all entries  for loan 6
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must  give Mr G a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Gs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 July 2019.
