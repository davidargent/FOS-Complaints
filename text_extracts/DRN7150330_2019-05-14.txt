Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint and thought  the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Quick Quid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN71503302But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, it seems  that the checks Quick  Quid  carried out on loans 1 to 3 
were proportionate. And although I think Quick Quid shouldve carried out better checks on 
loans 4 to 6b, due to the limited information we have  about Mr Ns circumstances at the time, 
I cant say that better checks wouldve shown that the loans were unaffordable  for him. So 
based on the information available, I dont think that Quick Quid was wrong  to have given  
Mr N loans 1 to 6b.
Ive gone on to consider the overall pattern of Quick Quids lending  history with Mr N, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Quick Quid should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Quick Quid  should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN71503303Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ns case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 7. I say this because:
By the time Mr N applied for loan 7, hed been  borrowing money from Quick  Quid  for 
13 months. And although the amount borrowed had reduced in loans 5 to 6b, the 
amount borrowed  in loan 7 had increased again.
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr N was provided  loans within weeks, and sometimes days,  of 
settling previous ones.  So Quick Quid ought  to have realised each time Mr N applied  
to borrow further amounts  that he was more  likely than not having  to borrowing again 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr N wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Quick  Quid.  For 
example, loan 18b was taken out 37 months after Mr Ns first loan. And it was (taking 
into account the outstanding balance on loan 18) for a much  larger  amount. And the 
amounts he was borrowing from loan 7 onwards werent necessarily decreasing over 
time either. So Mr N had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Quick Quid over an extended period.
I can see that there was a gap in lending between loans 9d and 10 of just under 7 
months. However as Mr N had been  borrowing from Quick Quid  for over 2 years  by 
that point, I dont think the break  in lending  was substantial enough for Quick Quid  to 
have reasonably thought that Mr Ns circumstances wouldve  necessarily improved to 
the point that lending  further amounts would be sustainable.
I think that Mr N lost out because Quick  Quid continued to provide loans from loan 7 
onwards because:
these advances had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ns indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ns 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 onwards and Quick Quid  should put things  
right.
Mr N repaid less than the amounts he borrowed on loans 18 and 18b. And since  our 
involvement, Quick Quid has waived the outstanding balance  on those loans. Quick Quid  
has said it will not deduct the outstanding capital balance it has waived  on loans 18 and 18b, 
from any redress that is due to be paid to Mr N. And I think this is reasonable. 
Ref: DRN71503304putting things right  what Quick Quid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 7 to 17c;
as the total amounts Mr N repaid towards  loans  18 and 18b were less than the 
amounts borrowed,  no refund of interest and charges is due on these loans.
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on loans 7 to 
17c from the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 onwards should be removed from 
Mr Ns credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick  Quid  must give Mr N a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Because of the reasons  given above, I uphold  this complaint in part and require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to do what I have set out above to put matters right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 June  2019.
