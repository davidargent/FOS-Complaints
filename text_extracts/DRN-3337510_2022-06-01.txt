The complaint
Mr F complained that AvantCredit of UK, LLC lent to him irresponsibly and provided 
him with unaffordable lending.

When Mr F complained to AvantCredit it didnt uphold his complaint so he brought his 
complaint to us. One of our investigators looked at the complaint and thought that 
AvantCredit shouldnt have provided the loan. Our investigator explained why he was 
recommending that the complaint should be upheld and he set out directions indicating 
what AvantCredit should do to put things right.
AvantCredit disagreed with our investigators view. It mainly said the loan purpose was 
debt consolidation and that using the loan to repay other debt wouldve helped Mr F.
So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved, it comes to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints on our 
website and Ive kept this in mind while deciding this complaint. Having done so, I am 
upholding Mr Fs complaint for broadly the same reasons as our investigator. Ill explain 
my reasons.
The rules dont say what a lender should look at before agreeing to lend. But reasonable 
and proportionate checks should be carried out. Lenders must work out if a borrower can 
sustainably afford the loan repayments alongside other reasonable expenses the borrower 
also has to pay.
This should include more than just checking that the loan payments look affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation  a proportionate check might also require the lender 
to find out the borrowers credit history and/or take further steps to verify the borrowers 
overall financial situation.
If reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out, I need to consider if a loan 
wouldve been approved if the checks had been done. If proportionate checks were done 
and a loan looked affordable, a lender still needed to think about whether there was any 
other reason why it would be irresponsible or unfair to lend. For example, if the lender 
shouldve realised that the loan was likely to lead to significant adverse consequences or 
more money problems for a borrower already struggling with debt that cant be repaid in a 
sustainable way.
I have reviewed the information AvantCredit gathered when it agreed to provide this loan. 
AvantCredit relied on an online check to verify Mr Fs declared income and recorded that his 
pay was around £1,250 per month. Alongside asking Mr F about his monthly expenses, 
AvantCredit also carried out its own credit checks to understand his credit history and 
current credit commitments.
Our investigator didnt think AvantCredits checks were proportionate. But, I dont need to 
make a finding on that point as it makes no difference to the outcome. Despite its 
affordability calculation appearing to show that Mr F should have had enough disposable 
income each month to cover the loan repayments, I think AvantCredit shouldve realised this 
was unlikely, given the picture painted overall by the other information it had gathered. 
And I think AvantCredit should have been concerned to see that when Mr F applied for this 
loan the credit report it obtained for him showed that in the previous 6 months Mr F had 
taken out six new short term loans two of them within the last 3 months. All in all, the total 
value of accounts hed opened in the last 6 months was £2,573. AvantCredit could see that 
Mr F had paid £701 towards short-term loans over the previous month. And he was 
currently paying £922 in total each month on his active credit accounts (not including any 
mortgage). So it was evident that his debt repayments cost Mr F well over half of his 
declared income.
Whilst having other outstanding lending or even an impaired credit history wouldnt be 
unusual for a borrower applying for this type of expensive borrowing, and it wouldnt 
necessarily be a bar to lending, I think AvantCredit shouldve realised that Mr Fs debt had 
got beyond his control and it seemed likely he was borrowing from one creditor to pay 
others. 
I've taken into account that AvantCredit understood the loan was intended for debt 
consolidation. But AvantCredit didnt have control over how Mr F used the loan as it paid the 
loan balance to him. And having seen the extent of Mr Fs money problems, even if Mr F had 
used this loan to repay existing debt, I dont think AvantCredit had sufficient reason to think 
this wouldve benefitted his overall position sufficiently to achieve a significant and 
sustainable improvement in his financial situation  given his outstanding indebtedness 
overall and reliance on using payday and unsecured loans. So all the indications were that 
he would most likely remain in serious financial trouble regardless. 
The fact that Mr F paid the loan on time doesnt mean that he was necessarily able to do so 
in a way that was ultimately sustainable for him.  
To sum up, I cant reasonably say that AvantCredit made a fair lending decision based on 
the information in front of it. I dont think AvantCredit was able to safely conclude that its loan 
would be sustainably affordable for Mr F. So it shouldnt have provided it and AvantCredit 
needs to put things right.Putting things right
Our investigator didnt recommend that AvantCredit should pay any additional redress. Mr F 
hasnt commented on that and I havent seen anything which makes me think AvantCredit 
acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr F in any other way. So Im not awarding any 
additional redress. 
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr F to repay the capital amount that he borrowed, 
because he had the benefit of that lending. But he has paid extra for lending that should 
not have been provided to him. 
In line with this Services approach, Mr F shouldnt repay more than the capital amount he 
borrowed.
AvantCredit should do the following:
add up the total amount of money Mr F received as a result of having been 
given the loan. The repayments Mr F made should be deducted from this 
amount
if this results in Mr F having paid more than he received, then any 
overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest* 
(calculated from the date the overpayments were made until the date of 
settlement)
whilst its fair that Mr Fs credit file is an accurate reflection of his financial 
history, its unfair that he should be disadvantaged by any adverse 
information recorded about a loan that was unfairly provided. So AvantCredit 
should remove any negative information recorded on Mr Fs credit file 
regarding the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. 
AvantCredit should give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if he 
asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to take the steps I've set out 
above to put things right for Mr F.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2022.
