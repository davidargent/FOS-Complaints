The complaint
Mr F is unhappy at how National Westminster Bank Plc dealt with a payment from his 
account. 
What happened
Mr F was purchasing a car and wanted to make a payment of £3,000 from his NatWest 
account. But NatWests fraud department withheld the payment. So Mr F made the payment 
by credit card and asked NatWest not to release the payment from his account. But they did.
Mr F has complained he wasnt able to speak to someone at NatWest when they withheld 
the payment, to confirm it wasnt a fraudulent transaction. Hes also unhappy that NatWest 
released the payment after he asked them not to. Because of this Mr F says he lost interest 
on the £3,000 he transferred to NatWest to make the payment, and that he was charged a 
balance transfer fee on the payment he made through his credit card.
Our investigator felt it was reasonable that NatWest had policies in place to protect 
customers from potential fraudulent transactions, but they didnt follow these procedures in 
this instance. Mr F shouldve been sent three text messages  advising that a transaction 
had been blocked, giving details of the transaction and asking if he recognised it, and 
confirming the transaction was genuine and the card could be used again. But NatWest only 
sent Mr F the first text message, six hours after the transaction had taken place. And Mr F 
was unable to contact NatWests fraud team after hed received this message.
He also said NatWest had acted unreasonably by sending the £3,000 to the car dealership 
after Mr F asked them not to. It then took four weeks for this money to be returned to Mr F.  
Mr F did a balance transfer as a result of having to pay by credit card, and because of the 
delay in having the money returned to him. This avoided any interest charges, but there was 
a balance transfer charge. The investigator said NatWest should pay Mr F £60 to cover this 
charge. He also said NatWest should pay Mr F an additional £200 to compensate him for the 
stress and frustration this situation caused.
Mr F didnt agree with the investigator. He didnt think NatWest shouldve released the 
payment after he specifically told them not to, and he thinks it took far too long for the money 
to be returned to him. And hes unhappy NatWest expected him to sort this out himself. He 
also says he couldnt return to work because of having to try and sort things out and he was 
concerned that other payments out of his account wouldnt be made because his account 
was frozen. Because of this, he doesnt think £200 is sufficient compensation for the time, 
calls, stress and impact resulting from NatWests error.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having reviewed the evidence I agree 
with the investigators findings on this complaint for broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the 
right outcome.
On 1 October 2019 Mr F purchased a new car through a car dealership. He paid them the 
final instalment payment of £3,000 from his NatWest account through online banking. As 
part of the online banking payment process, Mr F says he was required to put in a code 
which NatWest sent to him by text at 10:47am. While I havent seen any evidence of this 
text, I dont doubt that this was the case.
Around 5pm the same day the car dealership contacted Mr F as they hadnt received the 
£3,000 hed paid. At 5:16pm Mr F received a text from NatWest telling him they needed to 
verify a recent transaction, and his account was now blocked. It also said Mr F would receive 
a second text message with the transaction details NatWest needed to check. From what 
Ive seen NatWest never sent Mr F the second text message.
I agree it was reasonable NatWest flagged this transaction, as they have an obligation to 
take reasonable steps to protect their customers money from fraudulent transactions. But I 
think they shouldve done this sooner. And if theyd followed their process and sent the 
second text message, its likely that all of the subsequent issues couldve been avoided.
To avoid issues with the car dealership (he was worried his car would be repossessed and a 
black mark registered on his credit file) Mr F paid them £3,000 on his credit card. But he was 
unable to get through to NatWests fraud team to sort out whatd happened. Ive listened to a 
call that took place on 1 October where Mr F was trying to resolve this issue. NatWest 
couldnt put him through to their Fraud Team (they were too busy), couldnt resolve matters 
until he spoke to the Fraud Team, and told him he couldnt leave his number for the Fraud 
Team to call him back.
Mr F tried to raise a complaint about how he was being treated but was told he couldnt do 
this while the Fraud Team were involved. Its clear from listening to this call that Mr F was 
very annoyed, stressed and frustrated with how he was being treated by NatWest.
On 2 October, when Mr F finally managed to speak to someone in the Fraud Team, he said 
he didnt want the payment to go through now as hed had to make alternative payment 
arrangements. NatWest told him they would release the block from his account and refund 
the £3,000 to his account, which would take up to 2 hours. Mr Fs account was blocked from 
around 5pm on 1 October to around 4pm on 2 October - almost 24 hours.
Mr F was inconvenienced and clearly stressed by his account being frozen while the 
transaction was blocked. But this was for a period of less than a day, during which no other 
transactions were blocked or missed. So I think the impact of freezing his account was 
limited. Mr Fs said he was missing £3,000 from his account, but this was money he intended 
to leave his account on 1 October anyway. So this wouldnt have affected how his account 
operated had the payment gone through as planned. And Mr F didnt lose any interest on the 
£3,000, because he always intended this money to come out of his interest-bearing account.
Mr F called NatWest again on 2 October, around 8pm, because the £3,000 hadnt been put 
back into his account. NatWest said that, instead of refunding the money as agreed, theyd 
paid it to the car dealership instead by mistake. In a further call the following day NatWest 
told Mr F he had two options to get his money back. He could approach the car dealership 
himself, or they could do it for him. Mr F said he didnt want to do either of these, and he 
wanted NatWest to immediately refund the £3,000. He considered NatWest had stolen this 
from him  they paid it out against his express authority not to. When he was told this wasnt 
possible, he hung up.The dealership didnt refund Mr F with the £3,000 until 1 November 2019. NatWest offered to 
deal with the recovery of the £3,000, but Mr F declined this offer. I agree with the investigator 
that this wouldnt necessarily have been any quicker  NatWest say this process can take 20 
working days and it took a calendar month for the dealership to return the money. But, had 
NatWest dealt with the refund, it wouldve avoided Mr F having to deal with the dealership 
himself, and having to visit them to sign the refund forms. 
As NatWest couldve dealt with getting the money back from the car dealership, they werent 
given the opportunity to prevent any inconvenience Mr F was put to by doing this himself. So 
I wont consider this as part of the compensation NatWest should pay Mr F.
The effect on Mr Fs finances was that he had to pay the £3,000 by credit card and didnt 
receive the refund to pay this money off before his bill was due. So Mr F did a balance 
transfer to a 0% interest deal. This avoided any interest charges, but there was a 2% 
balance transfer charge - £60 for the £3,000 transfer. I agree that this couldve been avoided 
if NatWest hadnt made the payment in error. So they should cover this charge.
NatWest should also pay Mr F compensation for the time, calls, stress and impact of their 
error. This was clearly a very stressful time for Mr F. Hes self-employed and he says he 
couldnt go to work while he was sorting this out. Given the circumstances I agree Mr F 
wouldve been impacted on 2 October 2019 while he sorted this out, and this wouldve had 
an effect on what work, if any, he couldve reasonably done that day. 
But, barring one 10-minute call on 3 October, this was all sorted within a day of the car 
dealership telling Mr F the payment hadnt been received. As Ive said, there was a delay in 
Mr F getting the refund from the car dealership, but he declined NatWests offer for them to 
sort this for him. So I agree that the £200 recommended by the investigator is fair and 
reasonable for the short-term stress and frustration Mr F suffered as a result of NatWests 
errors. So I wont be asking them to pay any more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I uphold Mr Fs complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc 
must pay Mr F £60 to cover the credit card balance transfer costs and a further £200 to 
compensate him for the stress, frustration and inconvenience he suffered. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 March 2020.
