The complaint
Mr T has complained that Santander UK Plc has not been able to locate money he says he 
deposited into his savings account.
What happened
Mr T held a number of savings accounts with banks that now form part of Santander. He 
believes that a large sum of money (as evidenced by the passbook he has for one of his 
accounts) cant be accounted for by Santander. In particular, Mr T has complained about 
Santanders refusal to pay a balance from the account he opened on 9 December 1996. The 
last transaction on that account, as recorded in Mr Ts passbook was a withdrawal of £291 
on 9 March 2001. At that time the passbook shows the account had a closing balance of 
£4,800.71.
Mr Ts unhappy that Santander has refused to pay the balance of £4,800.71 to him. Hes 
also complained about the inconvenience he suffered when he made enquiries about this at 
a Santander branch. He was offered £50 compensation by Santander for the upset caused.
In September 2020, Santander wrote to Mr T to say their records show the account was 
closed on 8 December 2001, at which time the closing balance of £5,275.62 was paid to 
him. Santander also explained that Mr T may still have a passbook for the account, because 
they wouldnt ask for those to be returned before closing the account, if all of the security 
checks had been met. 
In responding to Mr Ts complaint, Santander also checked all the information available to 
them from their archives to try and provide him with as much information as possible. They 
were able to confirm that one of the accounts Mr T enquired about was most likely closed 
before that bank (who I will refer to as B) was taken over by Santander. They also identified 
the following three accounts (with the current balances alongside as at 21 January 2021): 
 
Account ending 1943, opened on 9 December 1996 with a current balance of £123.92
Account ending 4875, opened on 20 October 1995 with a current balance of £51.96
Account ending 1453, opened on 30 April 1997 with a current balance of £369.70
In response to Mr Ts query about shares he believed were due to him, Santander confirmed 
that they didnt offer Mr T any shares when they took over his accounts and deposits. They 
also explained that any shares he may have held with B, would have been declared to be of 
no value on 5 July 2010.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ts complaint and concluded that it wasnt one we could 
uphold. In doing so she considered the evidence provided by Mr T and Santander but 
concluded there wasnt sufficient evidence to show that Mr T was due the sums he believed 
were owing to him.
Mr T didnt accept our investigators view. He said he has clear evidence, including the 
passbooks, of the amount owed by Santander. He also says the dates and amounts dont 
make sense. Mr T requested an ombudsmans decision on his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator. I will explain why. 
Mr T has provided evidence including a copy of a passbook for an account opened on 
9 December 1996 with an opening balance of £3,000. Santander has provided screen shots 
from their systems to show the savings account ending in 1943 was also opened on that 
date. Our investigator concluded that given that account was opened on the same date, it 
was most likely linked to the passbook Mr T provided to us. Mr T believes that the balance 
showing on his passbook means that hes due the sum of £4,800.71. However, Santander 
has provided evidence to show that the balance of £5,275.62 was paid out of that account at 
the time it closed in December 2001. Theyve also confirmed the account had a current 
balance of £121 in 2007, and £123.92 as at January 2021.
Financial businesses arent required to keep records indefinitely. And, given the time thats 
passed in this case, it doesnt surprise me that Santander cant show exactly what happened 
to the money Mr T once held in his account.
What Santander have shown is that the balance of the account was around £317 in 2002 
and £121 in 2007. I cant know exactly what happened in the intervening years, but 
Santanders records suggest the large balance Mr T is now claiming, was paid to him 
approximately 20 years ago. 
Where the information is incomplete or contradictory, as it is here, I make my decision on the 
balance of probabilities, weighing up all the evidence to decide what most likely happened. 
In this case I think its more likely than not Mr T withdrew most of his money at some point 
between 1996 and 2001and for reasons which he, understandably doesnt now recall due to 
the passage of time.
Overall, I cant conclude that Santander has done anything wrong so I cant fairly tell it to pay 
Mr T the amount of money stated in the passbook.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2021.
