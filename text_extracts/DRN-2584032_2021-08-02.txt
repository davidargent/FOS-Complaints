The complaint
Mr S complains that he was mis-sold an Advance Account with Insurance Aspects (AAIA) in 
2014 by HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our adjudicator for the following 
reasons.
Mr S says that the process of moving him from his previous Advance account to an AAIA 
was unfair.
HSBC says it notified him in advance of the change in 2014 and sent him a letter each year 
asking him to check if he still wanted it.
Ive looked at the example correspondence that HSBC says it sent to Mr S in 2014 and in my 
view, it does make clear what the account change is and what his options are. As the post is 
normally reliable, I think its more likely than not that he received that letter.
In the following years from 2015 to 2019, HSBC sent further letters which explained the 
account and its benefits. I think its more likely than not that he received all or most of these, 
and if hed been unhappy, he wouldve raised a complaint earlier.
So, in my view I think its more likely than not that HSBC didnt do anything wrong in 
migrating Mr S from his previous Advance account to the AAIA.
I note that HSBC and Mr S have corresponded about other issues related to this, so to be 
clear this decision is only about the migration of Mr Ss Advance account to an AAIA.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2021.
