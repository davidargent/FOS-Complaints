Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ms complaint in part and thought  loans 5-8 shouldnt have been 
given. MYJAR didnt agree. So the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to make a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN52525772There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
MYJAR needed to do more when it approved loans 1-4. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Ms M had told MYJAR. So I dont think MYJAR was 
wrong to give these four loans to Ms M.
However Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of MYJARs lending  history with Ms M, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached at loan 
5. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Ms M was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Ms M had taken  out and repaid 4 loans within  12 months  and was 
asking for her fifth loan.  So MYJAR  ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not 
Ms M was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan(s)  
was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ms indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Ms M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed MYJAR.  In fact, the 
amount Ms M had requested had increased  significantly  by the time she asked for 
loan 5 and she was asking for it to be over a longer repayment period than 3 of the 
loans she had already repaid. MYJAR  ought to have known that Ms M was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Ms M had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to MYJAR over 
an extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted MYJAR to the likelihood that Ms M 
was having problems managing her money. I think that MYJAR  shouldve been 
Ref: DRN52525773concerned that Ms M might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing her indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Ms M lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 5 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Ms Ms ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-8 for the reasons given above.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Ms M paid on loans 5-8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 5-8 should be removed from Ms Ms 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Ms M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ms complaint. 
MYJAR Limited (MYJAR)  should pay Ms M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 March  2020.
