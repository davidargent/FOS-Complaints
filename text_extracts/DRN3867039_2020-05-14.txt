K821x#15Complaint
Miss M has complained that S D Taylor Limited (trading  as loansathome) acted 
irresponsibly when it provided her with unaffordable  home credit loans.
Background
This complaint is about 30 home  collected credit loans S D Taylor  provided to Miss M 
between February 2013  and January 2018.  The table at the end of this decision includes 
some of the information  provided to us by S D Taylor  about Miss Ms loans.
S D Taylor originally agreed  to make an offer on loans 5,7 and 27 because it no longer has 
the credit  agreements and affordability  assessments and as such cannot  confirm whether 
these loans were lent responsibly. 
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint from loan 5 onwards.  She considered S D Taylor 
should have done proportionate  checks,  it would  likely have discovered  that Miss M was 
having problems  managing her money and by loan 6 the pattern of borrowing  suggested  she 
had become reliant on this form of loan.
Miss M didnt disagree with our adjudicators view. S D Taylor didnt agree with the 
adjudicators conclusions asked for an ombudsman to review  the complaint.  So, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In doing so Ive also taken into account 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice.
S D Taylor gave Miss M loans 5 to 30 after the regulation of Consumer Credit  Licensees had 
transferred from the OFT to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on 1 April 2014. S D 
Taylor initially obtained interim permission to provide consumer credit before  it went  on to 
successfully apply for authorisation. S D Taylors  interim  permission to provide consumer 
credit and its eventual authorisation to do so meant that it was subject to the FCA rules and 
regulations from 1 April 2014.
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer. 
In other  words, the assessment needs  to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend. 
As set out in CONC,  the risk to the consumer  directly  relates  to the particulars of the lending  
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances. 
Ref: DRN38670392Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that S D Taylor should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include, 
but are not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to repay a 
given loan amount  from a lower level of income); 
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period); and 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that ongoing use of 
these loans may signal that the borrowing had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I can see S D Taylor took details of Miss Ms income during the application process  and I 
note it says it evidenced this by looking at Miss Ms payslips. It also took down her declared 
expenses. It said Miss M signed each affordability assessment to confirm it was an accurate 
reflection of her circumstances.  However,  Miss M disputes some  of the signatures are hers 
and has provided  us with her payslips which dont appear to tie in with the details recorded  
on S D Taylors  affordability assessments.
I appreciate Miss Ms concerns, but I dont need to reach a finding on this. I say this because  
I actually think by this point S D Taylor should have  done more than rely on the information 
Miss M was providing about her finances anyway. I think it should  have taken steps  at that 
time to have  verified  Miss Ms true financial position.  And, in this case, I think  that S D Taylor  
also ought to have questioned just why it was Miss M wanted or needed a fifth, sixth, 
seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth loan and beyond  at very high interest rates - if she genuinely 
had the levels of disposable  income it recorded.  
Given S D Taylors  obligations, I consider it fair, reasonable and proportionate for it to have 
taken further steps to ascertain that this genuinely  was the case, by the time of loan 5 and 
for all subsequent ones.  S D Taylor could have  done this by asking for evidence such  as 
bank statements, utility  statements or copies of other bills. I dont think S D Taylors checks 
achieved this.
To help us understand for ourselves what S D Taylor would more likely than not have 
discovered if it had completed  reasonable and proportionate checks  before providing these 
loans, we would normally ask Miss M for her bank statements. However, I dont think I need 
to recreate individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 5 to 30 in this case  for the 
reasons Ive explained below.
Ref: DRN38670393In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to Miss M 
by S D Taylor, I also think its fair and reasonable to look at the overall pattern of lending  and 
what unfolded during the course of Miss Ms lending  history  with S D Taylor. This is 
because, there may come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
S D Taylor was required to establish  whether Miss M could sustainably  repay  her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Miss M could 
sustainably make her repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.  
And, although Miss M had never been in arrears,  and settled  all loans  in full, it also doesnt 
automatically follow that she managed to repay them in a sustainable way.
This is because CONC defines sustainable  as being  without undue  difficulties  and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
It follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 5. 
I say this because  at this point  S D Taylor ought  to have realised Miss M was not managing 
to repay  her loans sustainably. Miss M had taken out 5 loans within 18 months. And, 
although Miss M was only taking  three  or four loans a year, she had actually been 
continuously indebted to S D Taylor for the entire time. 
Bearing in mind Miss Ms initial loan should  have  been repaid  over 41 weeks  (around 10 
months) and her indebtedness to S D Taylor should, to all intent and purpose,  have been 
discharged at this point,  S D Taylor ought to have realised there was a strong  possibility 
Miss M was having to borrow further to cover  the hole her loan payments  was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ms indebtedness may have been increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £500 with weekly repayments of £20. Loan 5 (which  was taken 
out at the same time as loan 6 and 7) was £200  and with repayments for loans 6 and 7, her 
weekly outlay was now £40. So, Miss Ms weekly payment was double  what  it was for loan 
1. 
In this particular  case, Miss M was in debt to S D Taylor  for an unbroken period of five years.  
This lack of any breaks in Miss Ms indebtedness  leads me to think  that it ought to have 
been apparent  to S D Taylor that Miss M was unlikely to have been using these loans as a 
useful means of managing cyclical income  shortfalls  especially as the loan amounts and 
total repayments across  overlapping  loans  increased.
S D Taylor says the amounts  borrowed  reduced.  However, looking at the highest combined  
repayments Miss M was making across multiple loans, although the amounts  fluctuated,  
there is an overall upwards trend in what she was repaying.
Ref: DRN38670394I think that Miss M suffered adverse consequences  as a result of S D Taylor unfairly giving 
her loans 5 to 30. I say this because: 
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness to S D 
Taylor by allowing  her to take very expensive credit over an unbroken and extended 
period of time and the financial  loss arising  (by way of interest and charges on loans 
she shouldnt have  been given) has unfairly exacerbated what was already an 
adverse and precarious financial position  for Miss M. 
The sheer number  of loans and length  of time they were taken over is likely  to have 
had implications for Miss Ms ability to access mainstream credit.  The greater the 
presence of these loans  on Miss Ms credit file the less likely Miss M was able to 
rehabilitate her finances and regain access to mainstream credit.
So Im upholding  Miss M complaint about  loans  5-30 and S D Taylor should  put things right 
as set out below.
Putting things  right
A)S D Taylor should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss M towards 
interest, fees and charges on loans 5-30.
B)S D Taylor should calculate  8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  
by Miss M which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date she 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)S D Taylor  should pay Miss M the total of A plus B.
D)The overall pattern of Miss Ms borrowing for loans 5 to 30 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so S D Taylor should remove these loans entirely  from 
her credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires S D Taylor to deduct tax from this interest.  S D Taylor 
should give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
My final decision is I partly uphold Miss Ms complaint and I direct S D Taylor  Limited  
(trading as loansathome) to put things right for Miss M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 June 2020.
