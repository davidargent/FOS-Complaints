In our most recent review of this case our adjudicator upheld Miss As complaint about loans 
4 onwards and thought these loans shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed as it felt the 
checks it carried out were proportionate, and that the loans were affordable for Miss A based 
on her declared income and expenditure at the time. So as Sunny disagreed the complaint 
has been passed to me to reach a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt think Miss As complaint about loans 1  3 should be upheld. Miss 
A appears to have accepted these findings, so as these loans are no longer in dispute, 
I havent considered these further. However, I have thought about all of Miss As loans 
when looking at her overall lending relationship with Sunny.
Sunny says it carried out an affordability check before allowing Miss A to take out any of 
these loans  which involved it requesting information about Miss As income and 
expenditure. But by the time Miss A was applying for her fourth loan, I think Sunny shouldve 
carried out a more thorough and proportional check of her financial situation - including a 
review of the lending history so far.Had Sunny have completed a full check of Miss As financial position it wouldve realised that 
she had taken out three loans within the same month and was then applying for a fourth loan 
in the same month. So, her borrowing in the month of March 2018 was a total of £1000, and 
Miss A was earning £1,300 per month at the time. Sunny says that it allowed its customers 
to borrow up to 4 loans at a time. But borrowing like this in quick succession, and to such a 
high value relative to her income, suggests Miss A was having problems managing money 
and may have had problems repaying these loans in a sustainable manor. Loan 4 was 
requested for £500, which was the largest amount so far. So, the amounts borrowed werent 
reducing and this suggests Miss A was getting further and further in debt. 
At the time of taking out loan 4 Miss As combined monthly repayment was £285.60 and 
considering her monthly income and total monthly expenditure I think these loan repayments 
made up a significant portion of her monthly disposable income. And so, a properly carried 
our affordability assessment was likely to lead a responsible lender to conclude that it was 
unlikely Miss A wouldve been able to repay loan 4  or any subsequent loans. So, I dont 
think Sunny shouldve lent Miss A loans 4 - 9 on this basis.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4  9 as I dont think Sunny shouldve provided 
further loans from loan 4 onwards. Sunny should put things right.
putting things right
refund all interest and charges Miss A paid on loans 4 - 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 from Miss As credit 
file;
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Miss As complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
