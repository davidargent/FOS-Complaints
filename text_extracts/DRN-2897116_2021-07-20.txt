The complaint
Mr K is complaining that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) reversed a payment hed 
received for £1,000, and charged him £30 for doing so.
What happened
Mr K sold an item on an online platform for £1,000. The buyer paid this amount to Mr Ks 
PayPal account and collected part of the item. The remainder was collected the next day by 
a third party courier, who unfortunately broke part of the item. 
The buyer raised a not received claim with PayPal through their buyer and seller dispute 
resolution process. PayPal emailed Mr K and asked him to provide evidence to defend the 
claim. This email gave Mr K ten days to respond, and said that if PayPal didnt hear from 
Mr K before the deadline, the dispute would be closed in the buyers favour.
PayPal sent two reminders to Mr K, both times reminding him of the deadline and that Mr K 
needed to provide documentation. After the deadline had passed, PayPal resolved the 
dispute in the buyers favour and took £1,000 from Mr Ks PayPal account to refund the 
buyer. And they charged Mr K a £30 fee for handling the dispute.
Shortly after this, Mr K complained to PayPal. He said he didnt have access to the email 
address PayPal had contacted him on, so he hadnt realised there was a problem. He asked 
PayPal to reopen the dispute. But PayPal didnt. They said their terms and conditions were 
clear that customers need to keep all their contact details up to date. 
Mr K was unhappy so brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked into the 
matter but didnt uphold the complaint. He said that PayPal had tried to contact Mr K on 
numerous occasions and that they had acted in line with their terms and conditions. He 
added that the request for information would also have been available on his PayPal account 
online  and noted that PayPal had shown him that Mr K had accessed that account on 
three occasions between when the dispute was raised and when it was closed.
Mr K remained unhappy and asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint  so its 
come to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I appreciate itll be disappointing to Mr K, Im not upholding his complaint. I realise 
hes lost a significant sum of money, likely because of a third party damaging goods after 
hed supplied them, but I cant say that PayPal have done anything wrong. Ill explain why.
PayPal have followed their processes and their terms and conditions. They tried to 
communicate to Mr K that he needed to respond to the dispute  and they warned him that 
failure to do so would likely mean it would be resolved in the buyers favour. They wrote to 
Mr K on three separate occasions and have said the request for information would also have 
been visible on Mr Ks online account.
Its unfortunate that Mr K didnt receive the emails. But this isnt PayPals fault. Mr Ks told us 
he no longer has access to the email address PayPal were contacting him on  but he hadnt 
told PayPal that prior to the dispute. PayPals user agreement requires customers to keep all 
their contact details up to date and I cant say thats unfair or unreasonable. 
PayPal are known as an online business  so it wouldnt be reasonable to say they should 
have sent Mr K a letter or phoned him. I appreciate Mr K thinks they should have reopened 
the dispute after he got in touch. But PayPal deal with a large number of disputes and so its 
reasonable for them to set deadlines and apply them  as long as they are communicated 
fairly. As Ive already said, Im satisfied they did communicate their deadline fairly to Mr K.
My final decision
As Ive explained above, Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2021.
