K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains about how PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie,SCA  dealt with a payment into his 
account.
background
Mr P says he sold an item on an online auction website but he didnt receive the payment 
into his PayPal account. He says the payment was then withdrawn by the buyer and so he 
complained to PayPal.  Mr P says his complaint has not been taken seriously and doesnt  
feel PayPal has told him the truth about what took place. He would like to know  where  the 
money went and cant understand why it says an old e-mail  address has been used by the 
online company  he used to sell the item.
PayPal says the payment was made using an old e-mail address that was once active on its 
systems. It says Mr P had changed his e-mail address but it appeared the company he used 
to sell the item still had the old e-mail  address  registered on its systems. PayPal says it 
acted in line with the account terms and conditions in such  cases and says the payment 
would have been returned to the buyer. It also says its a separate  entity to the online 
auction website  and so he will need to contact  it about any e-mail problems or other issues 
related to the sale.
Mr P brought his complaint to us but our investigator  thought  PayPal had fairly explained 
what had happened. The investigator  thought  PayPal had told Mr P there was a problem 
with the e-mail address  that he used and that it couldnt be responsible  for how the online 
business recorded that e-mail address. The investigator thought PayPal had acted in line 
with the account terms and conditions by sending the money back  to the buyer and didnt 
think there was any evidence of fraud or that PayPal had acted unfairly.
Mr P doesnt  accept that view and says his complaint hasnt  been  looked into properly. He 
says he was told by PayPal that the money had been withdrawn on the same  day by the 
buyer and so would  like clarity about  what took place.  Mr P questions  why there were two e-
mail addresses and would like to know where  the money went. He says hes been caused  
stress by what has happened and has lost confidence in PayPal.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for largely the same  reasons. I realise Mr P will be 
disappointed by my decision.
Ive looked at PayPals records of Mr Ps e-mail  address changes and can see that it held 
details of an address  which it says was used to process the payment in question. So I think it 
clear that Mr P did use that address in the past and that PayPal has fairly explained that this 
address was used  by the online auction company. I appreciate  that Mr P questions why that 
address was used  but Im satisfied that is not something PayPal can reasonably  explain  as 
its not responsible  for the other businesses records. I think  that if Mr P believes an old e-
mail address has been used then he would need  to take that matter up with that company.
Im satisfied that PayPal  has fairly explained what took place and what its terms and 
conditions say about payments made  in this type of circumstance. I can see that those terms 
and conditions say that the transaction would be cancelled and the money returned to the 
Ref: DRN10649682buyer which is what I think has happened here.  So I dont think PayPal has made a mistake 
here or acted unfairly and has acted in line with the account terms and conditions which I 
think Mr P would have agreed  to when the account  was opened.
I appreciate that Mr P says he was given different information when he called PayPal. But for 
the reasons Ive explained Im satisfied  that PayPal has explained what took place and why. 
Im also satisfied that PayPal has taken  Mr Ps complaint seriously and has replied to his 
complaint in writing  providing details of the relevant terms and conditions. I also appreciate 
that Mr P says he would  like clarity about what happened. But again  Im satisfied  he has 
been given such  information about what took place.
I accept that Mr P says hes lost confidence  in PayPal and Im sorry to learn  that hes been 
caused stress in dealing  with this complaint and with what took place.  But overall Im 
satisfied PayPal has fairly and reasonably given Mr P an explanation about  what happened 
and so I dont  require it to do anything further in the circumstances of this complaint. I also 
make it clear  that I dont  think PayPal  has made  a mistake  or acted unfairly  here and Ive not 
seen any evidence of fraud. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 November 2019.
