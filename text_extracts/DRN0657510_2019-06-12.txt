Mr H says that at the time of the loans he had other debts including  other short term loans 
and was gambling. He says his credit file would  have shown his financial situation  and that 
QuickQuid should  have realised from the number of loans he took out that he was 
dependent on the loans.  He says he needed  to borrow to make his repayments and cover 
his general living costs. 
Mr H says he contacted  QuickQuid on several occasions  explaining  that he couldnt meet  his 
repayments but no offer of an interest  freeze  was given.
Ref: DRN06575102QuickQuid says that before providing  the loans to Mr H it carried  out proportionate 
affordability assessments including  validating Mr Hs income and expenses. Based on these  
checks it says the loans were affordable. It says that Mr H didnt demonstrate that he was 
dependent on the loans  or that he was struggling  with his repayments.  It notes there  were  
gaps between the borrowing (including  a gap of 246 days  after the repayment of loan nine) 
and that seven of the loans were repaid early. 
Our adjudicator up held this complaint in regard to the additional borrowing on loan three 
and loans four to ten. He thought the checks carried out before loan one was provided were  
sufficient. He thought that Mr H should  have been  asked  about his short term loan 
commitments as well a his other  income and expenses information  before loan two and loan 
three were provided. However he said had this been  requested  the loans would still have 
appeared to be affordable.
Before the additional funds were  provided on loan three and before all subsequent loans 
were provided our adjudicator thought a full review  of Mr Hs financial situation  should have 
taken place. He said that had this happened, QuickQuid would have realised Mr H was 
spending large amounts each month on gambling and that these  loans were  not sustainable.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view and so this case has been  passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to consider.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN06575103I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H took out his first loan in November 2015.  The loan was for £250. Given this was Mr Hs 
first loan with QuickQuid and given the repayment amounts, I find the checks  carried  out 
before this loan was provided were sufficient.  
Mr H repaid his first loan and took out a second loan less than a month later. This loan was 
for a much larger amount, £500  repayable  over two instalments. The second instalment was 
for more than £600. Given the size of the highest  repayment compared to Mr Hs income 
and that this was the second  loan in a short period of time I think  it would have  been  
reasonable to specifically  check if Mr H had any other  short term loans outstanding, as well 
as checking his other expenses. 
Having looked  though  Mr Hs bank statements from the time, I dont find that by asking him 
about his other short  term loan commitments this would have changed the overall 
assessment of this loan.  Therefore, based on what I have seen, I dont find it unreasonable 
this loan was provided.
Mr H repaid his second loan early and then took out a third loan a couple of months later. 
This loan was for a lower  amount, £150.  However,  given Mr Hs borrowing history I think it 
reasonable that the same level of checks I noted  for loan two would have been carried out 
before this loan was provided. As was the case in loan two, I dont find that the further 
checks would have  shown  this loan to have  been unaffordable therefore  I dont  uphold  this 
complaint in regard  to the initial advance on loan three.
Mr H topped up his third loan a day after taking  it out and then again a day later. This 
increased the total amount borrowed to £475.  Given the of pattern of borrowing  that was 
emerging and the size of the loan following the first top up, I think  that a full review of Mr Hs 
financial situation should have taken place before  the first top up was provided.  Had this 
happened QuickQuid  would have realised that Mr H was spending  substantial  amounts on 
gambling and that lending  to him wasnt sustainable.
Mr Hs spending on gambling continued through the period of the loans and he also took out 
a number of short term loans with other providers. Based on this I do not find that the loans 
provided from the top up of loan three onwards  were sustainably affordable for Mr H.
Ref: DRN06575104I note the comments made  by QuickQuid about  the gaps between the loans. Aside from the 
gap between the repayment  of loan nine and the provision of loan ten, I dont think  it would 
have been reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude these were any indication that Mr Hs 
finances had moved  on from whatever situation  had required his previous loans.
I accept that there was a longer gap between loans nine and ten, around nine months. 
However, given Mr Hs borrowing history  I think it would have been reasonable to carry out a 
full review of his financial situation before providing this loan to ensure that his situation had 
changed and the loan was sustainable.  Had this happened, QuickQuid would have realised  
that Mr H was still spending a substantial amount on gambling and that lending to him wasnt  
sustainable.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to the additional funds provided on 
loan three  and all subsequent loans.  CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr H paid on the additional borrowing on loan 
three, and loans four to ten;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans three and four from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan five means  any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans five to ten should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 July 2019.
