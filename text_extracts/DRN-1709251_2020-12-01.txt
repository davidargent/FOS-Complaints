The complaint
Mr C complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) decision to close his 
banking account. 
Mr C is being represented by a third party. 
What happened
In January 2018 Mr C received a letter from NatWest informing him that it would be closing 
his business account in 60 days. So, he logged a complaint with NatWest.
NatWest investigated the complaint but didnt uphold it. NatWest said it had made a 
commercial decision to close Mr Cs account  and it had given enough notice in doing so. It 
referred Mr C back to the terms and conditions of the account. Mr C remained unhappy, so 
he brought his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. She said the account was 
closed in line with NatWests terms and conditions. In these terms it says NatWest can close 
a customers account, if it gives them 60 days notice. Our Investigator went on to say that 
she didnt find NatWest needed to give Mr C a reason for the account closure.  
Mr C has also complained about a second account, that he said his pension was paid in to. 
Our investigator has gone back to NatWest several times to ask that this account is located. 
Whilst the complaint was with the investigator, NatWest were unable to locate any other 
account under Mr Cs personal or business name. 
As Mr C didnt agree with the investigators view, the complaint has been passed to me to 
issue a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our services role doesnt allow us to interfere in commercial business decisions when they 
decide they no longer want to continue a banking relationship with a customer. In the 
circumstances of this complaint, thats essentially whats happened between Mr C and 
NatWest. 
What I can look at, is whether NatWest have followed a fair process in ending that 
relationship. And I think they have, Ill explain why. 
The terms and conditions of Mr C account allow the bank to close an account and it gives 
several examples of why they might do this, but NatWest dont need to specify the reason it 
uses to close the account to the customer. One of the conditions of closure is that it needs to 
give customers enough notice, to allow them to make arrangements to bank elsewhere. 
There are provisions available to shorten this length of time in some circumstances, but Ive 
not found NatWest have done that here. NatWest gave Mr C the full 60 days notice of 
closure. 
NatWest and Mr C have confirmed he received the notice of closure letter in January 2018. 
Ive also seen a copy of what this letter would have said, and Im satisfied it gives Mr C 
enough notice as mentioned above. 
So, taking everything into consideration, Ive found NatWest have followed the terms and 
conditions of the account, and it follows that I dont find NatWest have acted unfairly in the 
closure of this account.
Mr C has also complained about the closure of an account receiving his pension payments. 
Mr Cs representative has gone on to say that its been an inconvenience to now have to go 
and find an account elsewhere to accept these payments. NatWest and our investigator 
didnt investigate the closure of this account, as they said it hadnt been raised with the 
original complaint. NatWest have also since had issues finding the account. 
Before I issued my decision, I asked NatWest again to look for the account Mr C was 
referring to. NatWest have now located the account but have found the last credits to the 
account were in February 2017. It has gone on to say that the balance of the account was 
withdrawn, and any remaining balance was paid to Mr C when the account was closed. If Mr 
C would like a full investigation into why the account was closed, he would need to raise this 
as a sperate complaint to NatWest.
In summary, from my investigation, I havent found NatWest acted unfairly or unreasonably 
when they closed Mr Cs account. And it follows that I wont be asking NatWest to do any 
more. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2020.
