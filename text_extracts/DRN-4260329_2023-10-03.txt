The complaint
Miss B complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua incorrectly applied interest to her credit 
card account.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here in detail. But in summary:
- Miss B had a credit card account with NewDay. She repaid the outstanding balance in 
full in February 2023 and asked for the account to be closed.
- Miss B was later alerted by NewDay that £0.81 interest had been applied to her 
account. Miss B didnt think the interest was due as she had been led to believe her 
account had been closed and prior to this she had been on a repayment plan.
- NewDay refunded the interest and offered Miss B £25 compensation. But, in responding 
to the complaint, it reactivated an old complaint from November 2022 that had been 
settled.
- Miss B complained to our service as she was concerned about the potential 
consequences of what might have happened had she not contacted NewDay about the 
interest charge. And she was unhappy that NewDay hadnt set up a new complaint. 
- Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He thought NewDay had responded to the 
complaint fairly by refunding the interest and offering £25 compensation for the 
inconvenience caused.
- Miss B didnt accept this outcome, so the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion to that of our investigator for the same 
reasons. I appreciate that Miss B feels strongly about her complaint and will be disappointed, 
so Ill explain why.
Its not in dispute that Miss B cleared her outstanding credit card balance in full in                   
February 2023. NewDay has said that when the balance was repaid in full any previously 
agreed repayment plans ended. And based on how interest is charged a residual interest 
charge was due. I dont need to make a finding on whether NewDays statement is accurate 
or not as Ive seen  from Miss Bs account statements, that NewDay automatically refunded 
the interest charge the same day it was applied without intervention from Miss B. 
However, I accept that New Day sent an alert to Miss B. And concerned about the 
consequences of not repaying the interest charge she made a payment and contacted 
NewDay. NewDay refunded Miss B with the interest charge and, in doing so, it put Miss B 
back in the position she would have been had she not made the payment. This is what I 
would expect NewDay to do.  
I acknowledge Miss Bs point that her account had not been closed when she was told it had 
been. And had she not been vigilant and contacted NewDay when she realised that interest 
had been added to her account, there may have been further impact. But NewDay did alert 
Miss B of the interest charge and in contacting NewDay the matter was resolved. So, Im 
satisfied there werent any further consequences. And I cant award compensation for 
something that didnt happen.
But I agree this matter did cause Miss B some worry and inconvenience. NewDay has 
offered £25 in recognition of this. And overall, I think this fairly represents the inconvenience 
Miss B was caused when she had to contact NewDay to resolve this matter as it was 
resolved in a reasonable timeframe.
  
I acknowledge Miss Bs comments that NewDay reactivated an old complaint rather than 
setting up a new complaint to address her concerns. But ultimately, I dont find Miss B has 
been disadvantaged because of how NewDay responded to the new points she has raised. 
And Miss B wasnt prevented from referring her complaint to this service. 
Overall, I find that in refunding the £0.81 interest and offering Miss B £25 compensation 
NewDay has dealt with Miss Bs complaint fairly when considering everything that happened. 
So, I wont be asking NewDay to take any further action in respect of this complaint. 
Miss B has told our investigator that she doesnt accept NewDays compensation offer. But if 
 on reflection, Miss B now wishes to accept the £25, she will need to contact NewDay 
directly. 
 
My final decision
For the above reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
