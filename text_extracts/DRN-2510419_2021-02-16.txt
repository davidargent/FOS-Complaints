The complaint
A complains Barclays Bank UK PLC didnt stop a payment sent to the wrong account and 
wasnt able to get it returned when the error was discovered.
What happened
A made a payment for Â£7500 in April 2020. The payee name given to Barclays was the 
name of one of As directors but the account details were for another person. 
When the director realised the error he contacted Barclays. Barclays contacted the payees 
account provider but the provider was unable to get a response from the payee and the 
funds were no longer available to be returned.
The investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He thought Barclays had acted 
as he would expect it to act and given it wasnt Barclays payment error he didnt think it 
needed to do anymore.
A would like an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have a great deal of sympathy for As director; what has happened must be really 
distressing. 
However, I agree with the investigator Barclays has done what we would expect it to do. At 
the time of the transfer the mechanism for checking the name of the payee account wasnt 
available on As account as this mechanism was being rolled out and the roll out wasnt 
complete. It was As responsibility to check the account number and sort code were correct 
and unfortunately they werent correct. Once it was notified of the error Barclays contacted 
the payees account provider who in turn tried to contact the payee. Unfortunately, the payee 
hasnt responded and the money isnt there to be returned. I dont think it would be fair to 
expect Barclays to do anything more in these circumstances.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2021.
