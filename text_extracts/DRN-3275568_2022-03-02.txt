The complaint
Mr P complains that NewDay Ltd suspended his credit card account and transferred it to a 
debt collection company, despite having a payment holiday agreed with them.
What happened
Mr P holds a retail branded credit card account provided by NewDay.
Towards the end of April 2020, Mr P contacted NewDay by email. He said his income had 
been negatively impacted by the effects of the global pandemic. So, he wanted to apply for a 
payment holiday.
NewDay agreed to provide a payment holiday and said that Mr P didnt need to make any 
payments to his account until 16 August 2020. They confirmed their agreement in a letter to 
Mr P. 
In September 2020, NewDay sent Mr P a notice of default sums as they hadnt received any 
payments to his account with them. This was followed by notice of termination of his 
account. NewDay said that Mr Ps account had been transferred to their debt recovery 
department.
Mr P wasnt happy about the notices he received. So, he wrote to NewDay to complain. He 
told them hed applied for a payment freeze and, prior to that, had never missed a payment 
or exceeded his credit limit. He referred to guidance issued by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) which required NewDay to assist customers whod been financially impacted 
by the global pandemic. He said NewDay had breached the FCAs guidelines.
In early November, NewDay wrote to Mr P in response to his complaint. They didnt agree 
theyd done anything wrong. NewDay said theyd agreed a payment freeze until 16 August 
2020. Theyd also written to him in July 2020 to remind him when the payment holiday was 
due to end and asking him to contact them if he required further support. They said Mr P 
didnt contact them again, and they didnt receive any payments from him after the payment 
holiday expired. 
As Mr Ps account had been in arrears for more than 60 days, NewDay said they were 
required to take action to prevent Mr P falling into further debt. So, they withdrew his credit 
facility and transferred his account to a debt collection agency. They said they were also 
obliged to report this on Mr Ps credit file 
Mr P wasnt happy with NewDays response. So, he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our adjudicators investigated Mr Ps complaint. But our investigator didnt think 
NewDay had done anything wrong.
Mr P didnt agree with our adjudicators findings for the following reasons:
Regarding a missed payment in March 2020, when the first national lockdown 
happened, citizens were advised to prioritise their debts.
The FCAs advice in April 2020 was way behind the curve.
Although NewDay waived interest during the payment holiday, Interest was charged 
before and after and was increased from 30% to 50%, despite base rate being 
reduced.
Contact with NewDay wasnt possible as correspondence was ignored and calls went 
unanswered.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Ps complaint has been passed to me to reach a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to acknowledge the financial difficulties experienced by Mr P as a result of the impact 
of the global pandemic. I also understand that there have been other personal challenges 
that have impacted his situation. So, I appreciate this will have been a very worrying and 
distressing time for him.
Mr Ps account statements and NewDays records show that Mr P was unable to make a 
minimum contractual payment in respect of his March statement. As a result, his account fell 
into arrears in April 2020. So, it appears Mr P contacted NewDay for support around the end 
of April.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders on 2 April 2020 which 
explained what it expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances arising out 
of the global pandemic. It provided guidance asking businesses to consider payment 
deferrals of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
The FCA said their guidance applied where consumers were already experiencing or 
reasonably expect to experience temporary payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. 
They said, firms should ensure that there is no negative impact on the consumers credit file 
because of the payment deferral. 
NewDay agreed a payment deferral for Mr P and confirmed this in writing. They said the 
payment deferral would continue until 16 August 2020. They also said, If there were any 
amounts due at the time the payment holiday started, you will have to pay these immediately 
when the payment holiday ends. The payment holiday wasnt reported on Mr Ps credit file. 
So, NewDay appear to have met the FCAs requirements here.
The FCAs guidance also said, firms would be entitled to charge a reasonable rate of 
interest where a customer requests a temporary payment freeze. In the event that a 
customer requires full forbearance that interest should be waived.
NewDay didnt charge any interest or fees during Mr Ps payment holiday. So, the support 
they provided appears to go beyond what the FCA required.
Further guidance issued by the FCA on 1 July 2020 extended these measures, and where 
consumers were still struggling due to the global pandemic, businesses were advised to 
freeze or reduce their payments for a further three months. 
NewDay wrote to Mr P in late July 2020 to remind him his payment holiday was due to end 
on 16 August 2020. They also said any payments due before his payment holiday started 
needed to be paid then. Finally, they added, If youre finding it hard to pay, call us and we 
can work with you to find a solution. Mr P said he didnt receive this letter. He suggested it 
was sent by email and went into his spam folder. As NewDay wouldnt have had control over 
that, I cant reasonably hold them responsible.
NewDay said Mr P didnt contact them upon expiry of his payment holiday, and from what I 
can see, their files and records support this. Mr P told this service hed assumed that the 
payment freeze would be extended. I think NewDay made it clear, in their letters, he needed 
to contact them if he needed more support once the payment holiday finished.Mr P hadnt made a payment for his March 2020 statement. So, his account was already in 
arrears when the payment holiday was agreed. This was detailed on Mr Ps April 2020 
statement. And I think NewDays agreement and letters made it clear this needed to be paid 
by 16 August 2020. As Mr P didnt contact NewDay or make a payment, I believe NewDay 
were entitled to freeze Mr Ps account with them. 
Mr Ps last payment to his account was on 24 February 2020. So, at the point NewDay 
terminated his account and transferred it to a debt collection agency, the March statement 
payment, due 10 April 2020, was more than five months late. So, I cant reasonably say 
NewDay did anything wrong here. They recorded this information on Mr Ps credit file with 
the credit reference agencies in order to meet their reporting obligations, as set by the 
Information Commissioners Office (ICO), 
This services role as an Alternative Dispute Resolution Service (ADR) is to provide 
mediation in the event of a dispute. This includes examining and deciding whether NewDay 
have been fair and reasonable in the manner in which their policies and procedures were 
applied in the individual circumstances of Mr Ps experience with them. And I think they have 
here. 
Mr Ps commented on the timing of the FCAs guidance, but this aspect doesnt fall within the 
remit of this service. Likewise, while Mr P may be unhappy with the interest rates charged by 
NewDay, that isnt something this service is able to consider. Thats a business decision for 
NewDay.
I realise Mr P will be disappointed, but Im unable to find that NewDay have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here. They appear to have complied with all of the FCAs guidance. But Mr P 
didnt contact them when his payment holiday expired. So NewDays response appears 
reasonable.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2022.
