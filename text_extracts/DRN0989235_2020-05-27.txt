K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains about end of contract  charges  when  his agreement with Ald Automotive 
Limited ended.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint a copy of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I didnt propose to uphold  Mr Rs complaint. I 
invited Mr R and Ald Automotive to let me have any further evidence or arguments they 
wanted to make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr R said hed never been provided with a hard copy of the inspection  report  and didnt 
know the service history was missing  at the time of the inspection. He said the service 
documents, to the best of his knowledge, were  in the service  book.
Ald Automotive didnt reply to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken Mr Rs comments into account. But Im not persuaded that the service history was 
with the car at the time of the inspection. If the service history had been  with the service 
book as Mr R has said, then I dont  think he would have contacted Ald Automotive  after he 
received the invoice and advised that he had the service history and would provide it.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail on my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is that I am unable to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 June  2020.
