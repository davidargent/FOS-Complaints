K821x#15complaint
Mr F says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
QuickQuid approved 16 loans and 14 top-ups for Mr F. A table setting out some of the 
information about these loans and top-ups  is included as an appendix  to this decision.
 
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She thought 
QuickQuid was wrong to have approved  loan 9c and all of the subsequent loans. QuickQuid 
didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
Since the adjudication theres been  no ongoing  despite about loans 1-9b  so my decision 
will focus only on the remaining loans;  thats 9c-16a. I may still refer to loans 1-9b, but only 
because they form part of the history  of lending.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Fs case.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Fs complaint about  loans  9c-16a and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Fs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate. But certain  factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These could include  where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Fs complaint.  These questions are
Ref: DRN008280321.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr F would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Fs complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks  have 
shown that Mr F would have been able to do so?
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 9c to 16a because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point 
was reached by 9c. Ill explain  why.
In the first chain of lending, loans 1-6, Mr F had spent a little over a year indebted to 
QuickQuid. Although the amounts he borrowed remained fairly consistent, there was little 
break in the borrowing,  with no significant gaps between any of the loans. This suggests for 
that period of about 13 months,  Mr F wasnt able to free himself  of the need to keep 
borrowing and that he likely was struggling to repay the loans in a way which  was 
sustainable.
There was then a six month gap in the borrowing between loans 6 and 7. Despite the length  
of the period of borrowing (for loans 1-6) I think QuickQuid could reasonably have regarded 
this as a significant enough gap that it could  reasonably assume Mr F mightve been on a 
more stable financial footing. Having said this, given  the length of time Mr F had spent 
indebted to it, I think  QuickQuid ought to have been  more alert should Mr F start borrowing 
frequently again.
And Mr F did start borrowing more  frequently again from April 2016 until his last loan in 
November 2017.  There were 23 advances during this period (more  than one loan per month  
on average) and from loan 9 Mr F was also regularly topping-up his loans.  Bearing  in mind 
the purpose of short-term  loans and the relevant  rules and regulations,  the frequency and 
length of time for which Mr F wanted to borrow ought to have caused QuickQuid concern. 
I note QuickQuids own website acknowledges,  Short-term  loans should be used for short-
term financial needs only, and not as long-term  financial  solution. As a responsible lender, 
we do not encourage the frequent use of our service.
Loan 9c was the seventh advance Mr F requested in about five months (from April 2016). 
Once approved,  it increased Mr Fs highest  payment  to £775, his largest payment to date 
Ref: DRN00828033and well over 40% of his declared income. QuickQuid has suggested that at this time Mr F 
had disposable  income of £654 a month. But there  are a number of reasons I dont think this 
supports its argument  that it lent responsibly.
First, Mr Fs highest payment was £775  less than what it says his monthly disposable  
income was. QuickQuid may be arguing that Mr F couldve saved money, given the loan 
was repayable across  more than one month. But given  than Mr F was asking for his third 
top-up on this loan,  I dont  think its reasonable to suggest he was saving money  during the 
course of the loan.  Secondly, QuickQuid hasnt provided any evidence (such as credit check 
data) to support  how it arrived at this figure. Thirdly, I think  QuickQuid had reason to doubt 
what Mr F was declaring about his income and expenditure  and not just because  of the 
pattern of borrowing. QuickQuid says it established  Mr Fs credit commitments  were £470 
from a credit check, not the £50 Mr F declared.  So it was likely  Mr F was understating his 
expenditure to obtain new loans  because he wasnt sustainably settling them. And its not 
reasonable for QuickQuid to rely on what Mr F was declaring if it knew it was likely to be 
something it shouldve  questioned.
So having  considered everything, I think by the time Mr F requested loan 9c, QuickQuid 
ought to have realised the lending was no longer sustainable. And it shouldnt have 
approved this loan of any of the other loans in this chain of lending.  It shouldve been  clear to 
QuickQuid, at this point, that Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to sustainably  repaying 
what he owed it. And he was in effect  paying large  amounts of interest to service his debt 
with it over an extended period.
I think that Mr F lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 9c 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Fs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loans 9c to 16a because the overall  pattern  of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr F in some 
other way.  
Ref: DRN00828034putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  9c to 15b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from 9c means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 9c-16a should be removed from Mr Fs credit file
I understand there is still an outstanding  balance  on loans 16/16a. So QuickQuid should 
remove any interest and charges from this balance and treat any payments made as if they 
were payments towards  the principal.  QuickQuid may then deduct the balance of loans 
16/16a from what  it owes Mr F. It may only make this deduction if it still owns the debt.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr F a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
