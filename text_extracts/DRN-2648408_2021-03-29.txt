The complaint
Mr W is unhappy that MotoNovo Finance Limited declined his application for car finance.
What happened
In October 2020 Mr W visited a car dealership as he was looking to acquire a car. After 
choosing the car he wanted, Mr W needed a loan to finance the purchase. The dealership 
recommended MotoNovo, and Mr W made the application. But MotoNovo declined his 
application.
Mr W was unhappy that the application was declined  he said hed never been turned down 
for finance before, and that he had a good credit record. At the time he applied, Mr W was 
living in temporary rented accommodation while he was waiting for his new home to be 
completed. He was also unhappy that the dealership failed to advise him that his living 
situation would lead to his application being declined. And he was unhappy with the decline 
letter he received from MotoNovo, telling him to check his credit file.
Mr W complained to MotoNovo, but they didnt think theyd done anything wrong. So Mr W 
brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator thought MotoNovo had fairly assessed Mr Ws application by applying their 
lending criteria to it. But, because a lenders criteria is commercially sensitive information, 
the investigator didnt think MotoNovo had done anything wrong by not explaining to Mr W 
what part of their criteria he failed. So he didnt think MotoNovo needed to do anything more.
Mr W didnt agree with the investigator. He thought that MotoNovo had failed in their duty to 
ensure the dealership were sufficiently trained, and that they had sufficient product 
knowledge, to be able to recommend their finance. And he feels that MotoNovo havent been 
sufficiently transparent in their processes  they advised him to check his credit file when 
then were no problems with this that would mean finance should be declined. Because Mr W 
doesnt think hes been treated fairly, hes asked for an ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. I can understand this is likely to come as a disappointment to Mr 
W, but I hope my findings go some way in explaining why Ive reached this decision. Ive 
focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented on any specific 
point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
Firstly, I want to recognise the upset this has caused Mr W. Ive no doubt it came as a shock 
to him that the finance had been declined. But, for me to agree that MotoNovo have done 
anything wrong, Id need to be satisfied they didnt assess his application fairly and in line 
with their lending criteria. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive seen a copy of the letter MotoNovo sent to Mr W on 2 October 2020, advising him that 
his application for finance hadnt been successful. They explained that our decision is based 
on a number of factors, including your credit file information that is published on the credit 
reference bureaux, your personal details and the vehicle being applied for. MotoNovo also 
provided the contact details of two credit reference agencies should you require specific 
information in respect of your credit file data.
I appreciate this letter didnt explain exactly why the finance hadnt been approved, and Mr 
W found this to be frustrating. But MotoNovos lending criteria is commercially sensitive 
information. So I wouldnt expect them to detail the specific reasons why the application was 
unsuccessful. MotoNovo are required to give an explanation why the application was 
declined, and they did so in this letter  it was because Mr W and/or the vehicle he was 
looking to finance didnt meet their lending criteria in force at the time. 
While MotoNovo are required to provide the details of the credit reference agencies they 
use, the letter doesnt say that the application was unsuccessful only because of information 
on Mr Ws credit file. Nor does it say that he needs to contact the credit reference agencies 
to find out why the application was declined. It simply advises him of how he can obtain a 
copy of his credit file, should he wish to do so.
And, in their response to Mr Ws complaint, MotoNovo explained that while they couldnt 
specifically say why the application had been declined, they werent saying he was a bad 
payer. And they explained that Mr Ws temporary address may have caused some issues 
when locating your details with the external reference agencies we use, but they didnt say 
that the temporary address was the reason why the loan was declined.
Mr W has also raised the issue of the dealership not being sufficiently trained and MotoNovo 
have a responsibility for this. But the dealership wasnt acting as an agent of MotoNovo, 
theyre a separately regulated business. So Im not holding MotoNovo responsible for what 
the dealership may or may not have done. 
MotoNovo have also confirmed that the dealership wouldnt be aware of their specific 
lending criteria, so wouldnt know what would and wouldnt be accepted. And I wouldnt 
expect the dealership to know this. As Ive already said, MotoNovos lending criteria is 
commercially sensitive information, so I wouldnt expect them to share this with third-party 
companies such as car dealerships. 
Given the above, Im satisfied that the explanation MotoNovo have given Mr W was 
reasonable. And I havent seen anything to make me think MotoNovo acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in some other way. So I wont be asking them to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint about MotoNovo Finance 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2021.
