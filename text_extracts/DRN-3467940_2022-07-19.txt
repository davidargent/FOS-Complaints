The complaint
D complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the way they dealt with a 
chargeback claim raised against it by a buyer.
What happened
In November 2021, D sold a product to a buyer for $94.99, which it sent by post. Around two 
weeks later, PayPal received notification from the buyers bank, who Ill refer to as B, that 
the buyer had raised a chargeback as the product hadnt been received.
PayPal notified D of this, and D says it provided PayPal with proof of postage that showed 
the product had been delivered. But despite this, PayPal accepted the outcome of the 
chargeback claim, made by B, and refunded the buyer the purchase amount. D was 
unhappy about this, so it raised a complaint.
D didnt think PayPal had defended the chargeback claim fairly or reasonably. D thought it 
had provided substantial evidence that showed the product had been delivered and so, it 
thought PayPal shouldve progressed the chargeback to the arbitration stage. And it thought 
if it had, the chargeback wouldve been declined. So, D wanted PayPal to refund it the 
$94.99 that had been taken from its account.
PayPal didnt agree. They thought theyd acted fairly when accepted the chargeback 
decision, and debiting Ds account because of this. They also explained that due to the type 
of transaction the buyer completed, D wasnt eligible for the return of the $94.99 through its 
seller protection policy. So, PayPal didnt think they needed to do anything more. D 
remained unhappy with this response, so it referred its complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. They accepted D wasnt eligible 
under PayPals seller protection. And they accepted it was Bs decision on whether to accept 
the chargeback claim. But they didnt think PayPal had done enough to defend the claim on 
behalf of D. And our investigator thought, based on the evidence D provided, that it was 
likely the claim wouldnt have been upheld had it been escalated to arbitration. So, they 
thought PayPal should refund D the $94.99 along with 8% simple interest from the date the 
payment was taken to the date it was returned.
D accepted this. But PayPal didnt. They maintained their belief they had acted fairly when 
accepted Bs chargeback decision, which they didnt think they were responsible for. And 
they didnt think the proof of delivery D provided wouldve been enough to overturn this 
decision. So, they maintained their position that they shouldnt need to do anything further. 
As PayPal didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
It's not disputed that, due to the type of transaction the buyer completed, D isnt eligible for a 
refund under PayPals Seller Protection. So, I dont intend to consider, or discuss, this any 
further. 
Instead, my decision has focused on the actions of PayPal during the chargeback process, 
initiated by the buyer through B. While I accept that PayPal werent responsible for the 
acceptance or decline of the claim, for me to say theyve acted fairly I would expect them to 
ensure Ds claim was defended in a reasonable manner.
So, Id expect PayPal to consider the evidence D provided that refuted the buyers claim that 
the product wasnt received. And following this, Id expect this evidence to be put to B, for 
them to consider as part of the chargeback claim itself. And if this evidence failed to provide 
D with the outcome it hoped for, Id expect PayPal to consider whether progressing the claim 
to arbitration was the right thing to do. And unfortunately, in this situation, I dont think 
theyve done this.
Ive seen no evidence to show me that PayPal passed Ds proof of postage to B for 
consideration as part of the chargeback the buyer raised. Ive considered this proof of 
postage and I can see it shows the product as being recorded as delivered by the delivery 
company, to the same address as the address show on Ds invoice for the transaction. So, I 
think this is substantial evidence that B shouldve been made aware of, ensuring the 
chargeback was considered fairly. By not providing this to B, I think PayPal have acted 
unfairly.
I recognise this evidence may not have changed the decision B reached, and I accept 
PayPal couldnt control this. But as part of the chargeback process, either party is entitled to 
progress a chargeback to arbitration if theyre unhappy with the way in which the claim is 
settled initially. And in this situation, I think this is something PayPal wouldve pursued if they 
were acting fairly, as I think the evidence D provided is significant. As PayPal didnt do this, 
again, I think PayPal have acted unfairly. 
As I dont think PayPal acted fairly when they dealt with the chargeback claim on behalf of D, 
Ive then thought about what I think they should do to put things right. 
Putting things right
Any award or direction I make is intended to place D back in the position it wouldve been, 
had PayPal acted fairly in the first instance.
In this situation, had PayPal acted fairly, I think the postage evidence D supplied wouldve 
been sent to B. And, in the event this didnt change Bs original decision, I think PayPal 
wouldve passed the claim to arbitration.
Ive then thought about what I think is most likely to have happened, had this action been 
taken. And based on the evidence, which shows the product as being delivered to the same 
address as that given by the buyer and documented on the invoice, I think its most likely the 
claim wouldve been overturned and found in Ds favour. So, in this situation, PayPal 
wouldnt have needed to have taken the payment. Or, if they already had, it wouldve been 
refunded to D.
So, to place D back in this position, I think PayPal should refund it the $94.99. And I think it should add 8% simple interest to this amount, from the date it was taken to the date of 
refund to recognise the time D hasnt had this available to it. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Ds complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and I direct them to take the following action:
Refund $94.99 to D; and
Pay D 8% simple interest on this amount from the date the amount was taken from 
Ds account to the date it is returned.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2022.
