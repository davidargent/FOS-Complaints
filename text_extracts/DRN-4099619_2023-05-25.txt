The complaint
Mr S complains that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) delayed the transfer of the 
benefits in a group personal pension he held with it to a pension with another provider (who 
Ill refer to as provider A) in 2022. 
What happened
Mr S had a group personal pension with Aviva. In 2022, he was about to stop work with the 
employer the Aviva pension was linked to. He wanted to transfer his pension to provider A. 
There was a delay by Mr Ss employer in paying the final contribution to Aviva. It said that 
although it received the final employer contribution on 29 April 2022, the employer didnt 
provide a description as to how to allocate the contribution to the relevant employees. 
Aviva said that the employer confirmed the relevant split of contribution amounts on 4 May 
2022. Mr S said that the value of his pension, before the final contribution was allocated, was 
£179,520 on this date.
Aviva said it allocated the final employer contribution to Mr Ss pension on 18 May 2022. And 
that provider A requested the money three working days later, on 23 May 2022. It said that it 
then transferred Mr Ss pension benefits to provider A on 25 May 2022. It transferred 
£176,298.70, with an effective date of 23 May 2022.
Aviva said provider A confirmed that it had purchased the relevant investments on 31 May 
2022 and 1 June 2022. At this point a £2,000 advisor charge was taken from the fund. This 
was four to five working days after the payment was sent.
On 16 May 2022, Mr S complained to Aviva about the delay in the application of his final 
contribution. And the subsequent delay this caused to his transfer request.
Aviva issued its final response to the complaint on 7 July 2022. It upheld the complaint and 
said sorry for the delay and the poor service Mr S had received. It said it had failed to upload 
the final employer contribution until 18 May 2022, despite receiving the split it needed on 4 
May 2022. And that this had delayed Mr Ss transfer to provider A. 
Aviva said it shouldve applied the contribution on 4 May 2022. And that if this had happened 
then it wouldve received the transfer request from provider A on 6 May 2022. Aviva said it 
wouldve then sent the transfer to provider A on 10 May 2022.
Aviva said the fund value was £177,909.50 on 6 May 2022, which meant that Mr Ss fund 
value had decreased by £1,610.80 during the delay itd caused. But that it would need to 
contact provider A to ask it to carry out a loss calculation so that it could work out the 
position Mr S would now be in if the transfer had happened when it should have. It said that 
if the loss calculation showed a loss, it would make this up for Mr S. It also offered Mr S 
compensation of £150 to say sorry. 
Mr S was unhappy with this response, so brought his complaint to this service. He felt that 
hed lost the difference between £179,520 and £176,298.70, which is £3,221.30.
Provider A provided the information Aviva needed to complete the loss calculation itself. It 
said that it had used £174,298.70 to buy funds. And £2,000 was left in cash to pay the 
advisers initial fee.
Aviva then calculated that if it had applied the final contribution payment on 4 May 2022, it 
wouldve received provider As request to transfer the funds on 9 May 2022. It said the fund 
value on this date was £174,337.23. It said it wouldve transferred the funds to provider A on 
10 May 2022. And then provider A wouldve invested them four working days later, on 16 
May 2022. 
Aviva said it calculated the difference in units that wouldve been bought with the revised 
amount on 16 May 2022. It shared those calculations with this service. And said that they 
would need to be updated using the most recent price date as soon as we had reached a 
final decision. 
Aviva acknowledged that Mr S had asked for a specific amount in financial loss. But said that 
as it needed to put him back into the position he wouldve been in but for its delay, it couldnt 
agree to the amount Mr S had requested. It also said that the financial loss it would calculate 
would depend on the units that wouldve been purchased with the revised amount. So the 
loss that Mr S was entitled to was the loss in difference of units. Aviva apologised that it had 
failed to respond to Mr S with its calculations. And offered him a further £150 compensation. 
Our investigator felt that Avivas offer was in line with this services approach and that the 
dates and figures it had used were reasonable. He also felt that the £300 in total that Aviva 
had offered in total for the trouble and upset itd caused Mr S was reasonable. 
Our investigator acknowledged that Mr S wanted Aviva to cover the difference between the 
value of his pension on 4 May 2022 and the amount that was actually transferred. But told 
Mr S that there was no evidence that hed instructed Aviva to disinvest his pension on 4 May 
2022. So he couldnt fairly say Aviva had acted unreasonably by not using the value from 
this date. He said the default position without any disinvestment instructions would be for the 
pension to remain invested - and therefore subject to market movements - until the transfer 
request was received.
Mr S didnt agree with our investigator. He asked him to share the evidence hed relied on. 
Our investigator asked for further clarification from Aviva, which it provided. It said that it 
aimed: to work by a five working day turnaround time for each stage of any standard 
request. So, five working days to administer the payment after a transfer request has been 
received. However, if actions are completed earlier than the five working days we allow, then 
this will be incorporated into the ideal timeline.
Aviva also provided the actual timeline of events, compared with when it felt actions 
shouldve been taken. It said it had miscounted the days in its previous redress offer. And 
that it shouldve received the transfer request three working days after the contribution 
shouldve been uploaded on 4 May 2022, which wouldve been 9 May 2022, rather than 6 
May 2022. But it said that as the pension wouldve been worth less on 9 May 2022 than it 
had been on the 6 May 2022, it would continue to base its loss assessment on 6 May 2022 
in order to benefit Mr S. 
Aviva provided the following timelines.
Actual events:29 April 2022  Contribution received
18 May 2022  Contribution uploaded to Mr Ss account 
23 May 2022  Aviva said it received the request to transfer to provider A three working days 
after the contribution had been uploaded. It said the pension was valued on this date, as it 
always uses the date it receives its final requirement to value the transfer.
25 May 2022  Aviva said it had authorised the transfer payment. And that £176,298.70 was 
transferred. It said this value was calculated with an effective date of 23 May 2022.
What shouldve happened:
29 April 2022  Contribution received
4 May 2022  Contribution shouldve been uploaded as this was when the employer 
confirmed the split of the contributions. 
6 May 2022  Aviva said it based its original offer for redress on the request to transfer being 
received on this date. The value on this date was £177,909.50.
9 May 2022  Aviva said it shouldve based its offer on the request to transfer being received 
on this date, as this wouldve been three working days after the contribution had been 
uploaded. The value was £174,337.23 on this date.
10/11 May 2022  Aviva said the transfer payment shouldve been made. The pension would 
still have been valued as at 9 May 2022 in line with the date that Aviva wouldve received its 
final requirement.
Mr S felt that Aviva had been aware of his intention to transfer. And that it shouldve frozen 
his pension value as soon as it had received the final contribution. He also said hed had to 
speak to Aviva many times in April 2022 to chase the outstanding final contribution. And that 
when hed spoken to it on 29 April 2022, his pension had been valued at £179,520, with 
Aviva confirming receipt of the outstanding contribution that same day. So he said he 
expected a pension fund of £181,959 (£179,520 and £2,439) to be transferred to provider A. 
As Mr Ss pension was only valued at £176,299 by provider A on 25 May 2022, he felt hed 
made a financial loss of £5,660 (£181,959 - £176,299).
Mr S also queried some of the other pension values our investigator had shared with him. He 
said that the value of £174,344 as at 6 May 2022 didnt agree with a figure Aviva had given 
him as at the same day. This was £177,909.50. He didnt think either of these figures 
included the final contribution of £2,439, given that had only been processed on 18 May 
2022. 
Mr S also said that Aviva had been hard to contact during the time he was dealing with his 
transfer. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has come to me for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im going to uphold it. But I agree with our investigator that Avivas proposal for redress is reasonable under the circumstances of the complaint. Ill explain the reasons 
for my decision.
Where a business has made an offer to settle a complaint  as Aviva has done  what I have 
to decide is whether, in all the circumstances, that offer is fair and reasonable.
In this case, Aviva has acknowledged that it delayed the transfer. And has offered to carry 
out a loss assessment based on when the transfer shouldve taken place but for the delays it 
caused. As it initially miscalculated one of the dates used in that assessment as 6 May 2022, 
rather than 9 May 2022, it has offered to continue to base the loss assessment on 6 May 
2022 as that will better benefit Mr S. 
Aviva also initially offered Mr S £150 for the distress and inconvenience it had caused Mr S. 
But increased this by a further offer of £150, when the complaint came to this service. 
Mr S doesnt agree with the loss assessment. He thinks that the value of his pension 
shouldnt have fallen at all during the transfer process. He also questions some of the figures 
hes been given.
I first considered whether Avivas offer of redress is fair and reasonable. 
Settlement offer
Aviva has provided evidence which shows that, but for the delay it caused, the transfer 
payment wouldve been based on the value as at 9 May 2022. And it has also shown that its 
original loss assessment, which it incorrectly based on the value as at 6 May 2022, wouldve 
been more beneficial to Mr S than the correct assessment as at 9 May 2022. Aviva has 
continued to stand behind the more beneficial offer. 
Therefore, had there been no delay, £174,337.23 wouldve been transferred to provider A on 
10/11 May 2022. But in reality, £176,298.70 was transferred with an effective date of 23 May 
2022. So Mr S has received a larger transfer, but at a later date, than he should have. 
Aviva also said that its offer of carrying out a loss calculation offer is still open. This means 
that Aviva would pay Mr S the difference between the current value of his pension with 
provider A and the value it wouldve had if the transfer value had been invested with provider 
A on 16 May 2022, which wouldve been the correct date if thered been no delays. 
From what Ive seen, Im satisfied that Avivas offer is in line with this services general 
approach, which is to put a complainant back to the position they wouldve been in but for 
the error/delay. So I dont require it to amend its offer of financial redress.
I next considered Mr Ss point that Aviva shouldve frozen his pension value as soon as it 
had received the final contribution, given it knew that he wanted to transfer to provider A. 
Should Aviva have disinvested Mr Ss pension?
I can see that Mr S feels strongly that Aviva shouldve taken steps to protect his pension 
value once it knew he intended to transfer it to another provider. But I cant fairly agree.
I say this because I agree with our investigator, that until and unless Mr S instructed Aviva to 
move his pension into cash, it would still be invested. And its value would go up or down 
depending on the value of the underlying assets. 
Therefore, although I can see that Mr S expected the value of his pension to be stable, I cant reasonably hold Aviva responsible for the fact that its value fell over the transfer period. 
I acknowledge that Mr S has queried some of the pension values he said Aviva has given 
him. But Ive seen no documentary evidence of any incorrect values. And, as I noted above, 
Im satisfied that Aviva has taken reasonable steps to fairly assess Mr Ss financial loss due 
to the delay.
I finally considered whether the compensation Aviva has offered for the distress and 
inconvenience its delay has caused was fair.
Distress and inconvenience
Mr S said hed had to speak to Aviva many times in April 2022 to chase the outstanding final 
contribution. And that Aviva had been hard to contact during the time he was dealing with his 
transfer. 
I appreciate it mustve been frustrating to not be able to get hold of Aviva during a stressful 
time. But Im of the view that the total of £300 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience Aviva caused Mr S is reasonable under the circumstances. And it is in line 
with what the service wouldve recommended.
In summary, I consider that Avivas settlement offer is fair and reasonable under the 
circumstances of the complaint. And that it will put Mr Ss personal pension back into the 
correct financial position. And, although I uphold the complaint, I dont require Aviva to 
change its settlement offer.
Putting things right
Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited must ensure that Mr Ss pension with provider A is put 
back into the position it wouldve been in if the request to transfer had been received on 6 
May 2022. It should also provide Mr S with a clear explanation of how it has ensured that his 
pension is now back to the correct position. 
Aviva must also pay Mr S a total of £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
the delay has caused him. If it has already paid any of the offered compensation, it can 
deduct the amount previously paid from the payment. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, I uphold this complaint. Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited 
must take the actions detailed in the Putting things right section above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
