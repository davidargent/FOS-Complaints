The complaint
Mr L complains that Admiral Insurance Company Limited mishandled his claim on a motor
insurance policy. 
  
What happened
For the year from April 2020, Mr L had his vehicle insured on a policy with Admiral.
In late November 2020, Mr Ls vehicle was damaged in an accident. Admiral arranged repair
of his vehicle. Where I refer to Admiral, I include its repairer, claims-handlers and others
insofar as I hold Admiral responsible for their actions.
In December 2020, Mr L complained to Admiral about the repair and about the way Admiral
communicated with him.
By a final response dated 23 February 2021, Admiral upheld Mr Ls complaint in part and 
summarised its offer as follows:
£1,251.16 in lieu of repairs to the front suspension, wheel alignment (including
goodwill gesture of 2 new rear tyres) and new battery but not brake discs and pads.
£75.00 for distress and inconvenience; and
£25.00 for the delays in the complaint being addressed.
Unhappy with that, Mr L brought his complaint to us on 24 February 2021. He said Admiral
should pay more compensation including for corroded brake discs and over two months loss
of use of his vehicle.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that
Admiral had made a fair offer to put things right. He said that on 24 February, Admiral had
offered an additional £190.00 for loss of use of the vehicle.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr L 
and to Admiral on 9 August 2021. I summarise my findings:
Admiral intended to pay an additional £190.00 for 19 days loss of use of his vehicle 
for the period from about 31 December 2020 to about 19 January 2021 when Mr L 
bought another vehicle.
Admirals offer of £190.00 is fair and reasonable. As that offer slightly postdates the 
final response, I was minded to uphold this complaint in part.
Its file shows that on 24 February, Admiral issued a cheque for £90.00 rather than 
£190.00 for loss of use.
Subject to any further information from Mr L or from Admiral , my provisional decision was 
that I upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct Admiral Insurance Company Limited 
to pay Mr L  in addition to what it has already paid him  a further £100.00 for loss of use of 
his vehicle.
Mr L hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
Admiral disagrees with the provisional decision in part. It says, in summary, that:
It paid Mr L £190.00 in total for loss of use as intended. On 15 February 2021 it sent 
Mr L a cheque for £220.00. This cheque represented £120.00 to reimburse him for 
the recovery costs invoice, and £100.00 to represent the period he was without a 
vehicle. Unfortunately, the handler who raised this cheque did not make it specifically 
clear in any email sent to Mr L. However, their final decision letter dated 23 February 
2021 refers to the first payment of £100.00 for loss of use as follows:
 I understand you are unhappy you did not receive a courtesy vehicle as 
promised. I reviewed the file and can see you called in to notify us of the issue. 
You advised you arrived at [hire company} and there was a mix up between the 
vehicle and the cover note. You then advised you did not wish to use [hire 
company] for a hire vehicle and that you had got taxis for the duration. When we 
discussed this on the phone you advised the taxis amounted to a total of £100 
and I have reimbursed this. I am sorry for the inconvenience caused. I have 
upheld this point.
On 24 February 2021, the complaint handler then makes the decision to supply an 
additional £90.00 as they had been informed the customer purchased a new vehicle 
on 19 January 2021. The £90.00 was raised on this day and a subsequent email sent 
to the customer the same day confirms as follows:
 we are covering the loss of use at a rate of £10 per day from the 
[31/12/2020]  19/01/2021. If you have any other financial losses please can 
you send in the receipts and evidence for this for me to consider.
There are obvious errors where the complaint handler has not made it clear in their 
correspondence what payments had been made and when, but it has made a total 
payment of £190.00 to represent 19 days at £10.00 a day for loss of use as promised 
albeit over two payments.
It also reimbursed the customer £42.74 on 3 March 2021 for taxis fares incurred after 
receiving corresponding receipts.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a policy schedule that says the car had been made in 2014 and had a number
plate personal to Mr L.
The policy booklet said that Admirals repairer would provide a courtesy car while it was
doing any repair. I would expect that to include the duration of any rectification of the repair.I note that Mr L reported that a third party had changed lanes on a roundabout and hit Mr Ls
vehicle on the drivers side and front. A couple of days later the repairer had the vehicle and 
noted a mileage of about 41,500.
In mid-December 2020, Mr L collected the vehicle and took it for an MOT test. Ive listened
to the recording of the call he made to Admiral. He complained about unrepaired damage to
the suspension bush at the front on the drivers side. Admiral said that this damage was
wear and tear rather than related to the accident. Towards the end of the call Mr L
mentioned that he had other vehicles available to him.
By mid-January 2021, Admiral had received an independent assessors report and decided
to give Mr L the benefit of the doubt on the issue of the suspension. I consider that it was fair
to do so  as the drivers side bush was ruptured and the passengers side bush wasnt.
On about 19 January, Mr L says he bought another car. But he hasnt provided any details of
that car or its cost.
By early February, Mr L was complaining that the suspension hadnt been repaired and that,
due to lack of use, the brake discs had corroded, and the battery was flat.
From its file, I find that Admirals final response offer on 23 February was as follows:
suspension £   667.20
rear tyres £   254.96
battery £   329.00
distress & inconvenience £     75.00
delay in response £     25.00
total £1,351.16
In addition, the final response said that Admiral had reimbursed £100.00 for taxis.
Admiral didnt accept responsibility for replacing brake pads and discs. Mr L has shown us
video evidence of corrosion. And he says it could only be caused by the vehicle standing
unused. But  keeping in mind the age and mileage of the vehicle  I consider that Mr L has
fallen short of showing that Admiral was responsible for damage to the brake discs or pads. I
dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to pay to replace them.
Ive thought about whether it would be fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to increase its
payment for distress and inconvenience. And I accept that Admirals initial decision about the
suspension  and its subsequent delay  caused Mr L extra distress and inconvenience at
an already stressful time for him.
But I keep in mind that Admiral has paid Mr L the cost of two rear tyres and a new battery.
So overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to increase its payment for
distress and inconvenience.
From its file I see that on 24 February 2021 Admiral made the following note:
HAVE ADDED ADDITONAL PAYMENT DUE TO THE CUSTOMER BOUGHT A
NEW VEHICLE ON THE 19TH SO WE HAVE COVERED LOU DOR 19 DAYS @10
PER DAY
From that note, I find that Admiral intended to pay an additional £190.00 for 19 days loss of
use of his vehicle for the period from about 31 December 2020 to about 19 January 2021when Mr L bought another vehicle. 
Mr L has said that he couldve hired his vehicle out for about £50.00 per day. But he hasnt
provided any evidence that he had that opportunity and lost it. And he has said that he had
other vehicles available for him to drive. So I find Admirals offer of £190.00 is fair and
reasonable. As that offer slightly postdates the final response, I uphold this complaint in part.
Its file shows that on 24 February, Admiral issued a cheque for £90.00 rather than £190.00
for loss of use. So my provisional decision was to direct Admiral to pay Mr L  in addition to 
what it has already paid him  a further £100.00 for loss of use of his vehicle.
In response to the provisional decision, Admiral has said that it has already reimbursed Mr L 
for taxis. I accept that reimbursement for taxis couldve been an alternative to compensation 
for loss of use of Mr Ls own vehicle. However, thats not what Admiral said when  the day 
after the final response  it offered £10.00 per day for 19 days loss of use.  
Putting things right
So  notwithstanding the reimbursement for taxis  I still find it fair and reasonable to hold 
Admiral to its offer of £190.00 and to direct it to pay Mr L the balance of £100.00.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Admiral Insurance Company Limited to pay Mr L  in addition to what it has already 
paid him  a further £100.00 for loss of use of his vehicle.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2021.
