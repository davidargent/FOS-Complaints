The complaint
Mrs T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed her account 
without providing an explanation or warning. She says this caused her unnecessary 
inconvenience and worry for which she should be compensated.
What happened
Mrs T was a long standing customer of NatWest.
In September 2022, NatWest decided to review how Mrs T was operating her account. 
Whilst it conducted its review the bank blocked Mrs Ts access to her account, this meant 
Mrs T couldnt access the funds in the account. NatWest blocked Mrs Ts account for ten 
days. Following its review NatWest decided to close Mrs Ts account and gave her 60 days 
notice to find another account. Mrs T had full access to her account during the notice period.
Mrs T complained to NatWest about the block and closure of her account. NatWest said it 
hadnt done anything wrong and had complied with the terms and conditions of the account. 
The bank also explained that it didnt have to provide Mrs T with the reasons for its actions 
and that it had written to Mrs T advising her about the review. And told her to move her direct 
debits to mitigate any impact on her regular outgoings. 
Unhappy with this response Mrs T brought her complaint to our service. Mrs T says she 
called NatWest on several occasions trying to find out why she couldnt access her account. 
But NatWest wouldnt give her much information. Mrs T has also said that she made a 
number of trips to branch, which given she uses a wheelchair was difficult and exhausting. 
She wants NatWest to apologise, explain why it closed her account and pay her 
compensation for the trouble and upset its actions caused her. 
One of our investigators reviewed Mrs Ts complaint and asked NatWest to provide more 
information about why it had blocked and closed Mrs Ts account. NatWest said that it was 
entitled to block and close Mrs Ts account. But said it couldnt provide anything more than it 
had already provided to us. The investigator said that based on the limited information the 
bank had provided, he couldnt say the bank had treated Mrs T fairly when it had blocked 
and closed her account. So, he said NatWest should pay Mrs T £100 compensation for the 
trouble and upset shed been caused by the banks actions. 
NatWest accepted the investigators recommendation. Mrs T didnt. She said that the 
compensation isnt enough to make up for the sleepless nights, upset and inconvenience 
that the block and closure of her account caused. Mrs T says she is also a vulnerable 
customer due to her disability. She wants more compensation and NatWest to provide a 
proper explanation for why it blocked and closed her account.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest have important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect 
persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to an account to conduct a review on a customer and/or 
the activity on an account. The terms of the account also permit NatWest to block an 
account. This means NatWest is entitled to block and review an account at any time.
Banks are also entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as this is 
done fairly, doesnt breach law or regulations and is in keeping with the terms and 
conditions. In this instance the terms of Mrs Ts account say that in certain instances 
NatWest can close the account with immediate notice and by providing 60 days notice to a 
customer. And it doesnt have to provide a reason for doing so. 
NatWest wrote to Mrs T in November 2022, giving her 60 days notice that it was closing her 
accounts and that shed need to make alternative banking arrangements.
I understand Mrs T wants NatWest to explain the reason it blocked and closed her account.   
It cant be pleasant being told you are no longer wanted as a customer  especially after 
being a customer of NatWest for as long as Mrs T had.  But NatWest doesnt disclose to its 
customers what triggers a review of their accounts to its customers. Its under no obligation 
to tell Mrs T the reasons behind the account review and block, as much as shed like to 
know. It also doesnt have to provide Mrs T with the reasons it no longer wants her as a 
customer. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mrs T this information. And it 
wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it do so. 
However, NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a 
complaint. Despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest has failed to provide 
information about why it blocked and closed Mrs Ts account. Ive considered what NatWest 
has said about why it wont provide further information to our service. And the information it 
has provided about why it blocked and closed Mrs Ts account. This service has the power 
to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im not 
persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, in 
this particular case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest has 
treated Mrs T fairly when it blocked and closed her account. Taking this into account, I agree 
with the investigator that NatWest should pay Mrs T compensation for the trouble and upset 
caused by blocking and closing her account.
The investigator said that NatWest should pay Mrs T £100 compensation. Mrs T doesnt 
think this is enough and wants more. I should explain that there isnt a set formula that we 
use to calculate awards for particular mistakes or poor service. Its my role to consider what 
impact NatWests actions have had on Mrs T and decide, within guidelines set by our 
service, whether compensation would be appropriate in the circumstances. 
Ive considered what Mrs T has said about her circumstances and how NatWests actions 
impacted her. Ive no doubt this was a worrying and stressful time for Mrs T. Mrs T says she 
had to borrow money from her daughter to pay for things. She also had to go to the trouble 
of rearranging her finances which included organising her direct debits and regular payments 
into the account. She also visited a branch on at least three occasions, which would have 
been inconvenient.  Having considered the impact on Mrs T and taking into consideration the available evidence, 
Im satisfied that the block and closure of her account has caused Mrs T trouble and upset. 
Therefore, I think she should receive compensation for this. Im satisfied that £100 
compensation recommended by the investigator recognises the impact NatWests actions 
had in the overall circumstances of this complaint. So, whilst I accept Mrs T wont agree, I 
wont be directing NatWest to pay any more compensation to resolve her complaint.    
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank 
Plc to put things right by doing the following: 
Pay Mrs T £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank closing 
and blocking her account
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
