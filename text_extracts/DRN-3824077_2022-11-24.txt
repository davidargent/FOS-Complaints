The complaint
Mr and Mrs K are unhappy at the customer service they received from Nationwide Building 
Society when switching their mortgage to a new interest rate product. Mr and Mrs K want 
Nationwide to review its procedures, and to put their mortgage on the 0.99% five-year fixed 
rate product they say they had wanted from the first time they contacted Nationwide on 16 
 June 2021. They would also like Nationwide to refund the difference in the interest theyve 
paid on the higher 1.44% interest rate product they took out on 21 June 2021 and the 0.99% 
interest rate product they actually wanted.
What happened
Mr and Mrs K have a mortgage with Nationwide. It was on an interest rate product that was 
due to expire in September 2021. Nationwide allows a product to be switched to a new rate 
within three months of the expiry date of the previous product.
The chronology of telephone calls between Mr and Mrs K and Nationwide is set out in detail 
in the correspondence between the parties, so Im not going to repeat it all here. But the 
main issue relates to the valuation of the property. 
On 16 June 2021 Mrs K (who has dealt with both the product switch and the complaint 
throughout) spoke to Nationwide about switching to a new product. Nationwide said its 
valuation of the property was £260,000 but Mrs K thought it was £280,000 and was told that 
Nationwides valuation could be appealed. Incorrectly, Mrs K was told that the valuation may 
come back with a higher figure. During that call Mrs K asked about making an overpayment 
of £10,000.
The significance of the valuation is that the higher the valuation, the lower the loan to value 
ratio (LTV). If the LTV is below 60%, lower interest rate products are available to customers.
Mrs K called back on 19 June 2021. She was interested in a five-year fixed rate product, at a 
rate of 1.44%. Mrs K was also thinking about making an overpayment and reducing the term 
to 27 years, and wanted to keep repayments under £700 per month. Mrs K said the property 
valuation was £280,000.
On 21 June 2021 Mr and Mrs K reserved the five-year fixed rate of 1.44% and requested a 
term reduction to 27 years, starting from 1 July 2021. No overpayment was made to the 
mortgage to reduce the balance. The product selected was in the range of interest rates 
available to customers where the LTV is over 60% but below 75%. The product switch offer 
shows the valuation of the property is assumed to be £280,000, which is what Mrs K said 
she thought the property was worth when she spoke to Nationwide on 16 June 2021.
On 21 July 2021 Nationwide introduced a 0.99% five-year fixed rate for customers within the 
0 to 60% LTV range.
On 19 August Mrs K complained to Nationwide that she thought her house was worth more 
than £300,000 and that she could have had a lower rate of 0.99%. Mrs K was told that even 
if the property was worth that amount, this would not reduce the LTV to below 60%. 
Thereafter there were further calls between Mrs K and Nationwide. Mrs K felt the property 
was undervalued, and that she could have paid £10,000 to reduce the LTV below 60%. 
Nationwide said that Mrs K had said in June 2021 that the valuation was £280,000 and this 
wasnt challenged in the product switch offer. But Mrs K she said that, if shed realised the 
implications, shed have said the property was worth £350,000. 
Mrs K complained. Nationwide acknowledged that its customer service could have been 
better, because call backs werent made, a complaint wasnt logged and Mrs K was given 
incorrect information on her initial call on 16 June 2021 when she was told the valuation 
might be higher. Nationwide offered compensation of £100 for this. But Nationwide didnt 
agree that Mr and Mrs K;s mortgage should be switched to the 0.99% rate. Nationwide said 
that any switch would be subject to Mr and Mrs K paying the early repayment charge (ERC) 
on their current product.
Mrs K didnt agree with what Nationwide said and so she and Mr K brought their complaint to 
our service.
An investigator looked at what had happened, but didnt think the complaint should be 
upheld. He thought the £100 compensation offered by Nationwide for its customer service 
was reasonable.
Mrs K disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint. Shes reiterated all 
her concerns about the way Nationwide handled the matter. In addition, Mrs K has offered to 
provide receipts for the work done to improve the property.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On her complaint form to us Mrs K said:
My intention from my first contact with Nationwide was to reduce my loan to value in 
order to secure the 0.99% interest rate fixed for 5 years. I had over £10,000 to use to 
do this and if my house had been valued at £295,000 the £10,000 payment would 
have put my LTV to under 60% and I would have been eligible for the 0.99% interest 
rate. Due to incorrect information and my belief that Nationwide had valued my 
property fairly, I was aware that £10,000 on a £280,000 valuation would not change 
the LTV and therefore I fixed at 1.44%. If I had been given the correct advice and 
information at the time, this would not have happened.
Ive looked at the interest rates that were available on 16 June 2021 (when Mrs K first had 
contact with Nationwide about a new interest rate product) and there was no 0.99% interest 
rate product available at that time. So I have some difficulty with what Mrs K says about this; 
the 0.99% rate wasnt introduced until 21 July 2021, a month after Mr and Mrs K had fixed 
their mortgage on the 1.44% interest rate.
It was Mrs K who initially said she thought the property was worth £280,000, and this wasnt 
challenged by her when it was shown on the product switch document. In any event, even if 
Mr and Mrs K had reduced their mortgage balance by 10%, this still wouldnt have brought 
their LTV below 60%. The mortgage balance was approximately £184,000, in addition to 
which Mr and Mrs K added the £999 product fee to the mortgage.Nationwide reviews its valuation figures quarterly, based on the House Prices Index and 
other factors. I note that Mr and Mrs K fixed their mortgage before the end of June 2021. The 
new quarter began on 1 July 2021. During that quarter, the indices Nationwide uses for its 
valuations meant that the property went up in value. But that doesnt mean Nationwide made 
a mistake in agreeing with Mrs Ks valuation of the property at £280,000 in June 2021.
In the circumstances, there is no basis on which I can fairly order Nationwide to switch the 
mortgage to the 0.99% five-year fixed rate interest rate product.
I am glad Nationwide has acknowledged that its customer service fell short, for the reasons 
detailed in correspondence between the parties. Nationwide offered £100 for this, which I 
think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. I am not ordering Nationwide to do 
anything further or pay any additional compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that, in full and final settlement of this complaint, Nationwide Building 
Society should pay Mr and Mrs K compensation for distress and inconvenience of £100.
This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means that we are unable to consider the complaint any further, nor enter into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K and Mr K to 
accept or reject my decision before 22 December 2022.
