The complaint
Mr B has complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) rejected his claim 
against it under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Background
Mr B bought solar panels for his home in year 2015. The purchase was funded by a loan 
from Creation, and that business is therefore liable for the acts and omissions of the installer 
under the relevant legislation. In this case, that relates to the installer misleading Mr B into 
believing that the panels would be self-funding, which they werent.
Creation made an offer to settle the complaint. But its redress offer didnt take into account 
that Mr B had settled his loan with Creation early by taking out finance with a different 
provider. Mr B felt the offer did not fully compensate him for his losses.
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. He thought that the benefits of 
the panels were mis-represented to Mr B, and that fair redress would be for the loan to be 
restructured to effectively make the panels self-funding. This restructure should be based on 
evidence of the actual performance of the panels, and a number of assumptions on future 
performance. He explained Creation should take into account the losses Mr B incurred with 
the refinance loan he took with an alternative provider in order to fully compensate him. 
Creation didnt respond so the case was passed to an ombudsman. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Creation is familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at complaints of this type, and indeed our well-established approach. So, I 
dont consider it necessary to set all of that out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, for the same reasons as those explained 
by the adjudicator, I uphold this case. In brief, that is because the evidence supports the 
conclusion that a misrepresentation took place and Mr B was not given clear information to 
demonstrate that the solar panels would not be self-funding and would equate to an 
additional cost for him.
So, I think that Creation didnt treat Mr B fairly and he lost out because of what Creation did 
wrong. And this means that it should put things right. 
Fair compensation  what Creation needs to do to put things right for Mr B
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Bs complaint for Creation to put things right by recalculating the original 
loan based on the known and assumed savings and income to Mr B from the solar panels 
over the 10 year term of the loan so he pays no more than that, and he keeps the solar 
panel system, and any future benefits once the loan has ended. 
In the event the calculation shows that Mr B is paying (or has paid) more than he should 
have Creation needs to reimburse Mr B accordingly. Should the calculation show that the 
misrepresentation has not caused a financial loss, then the calculation should be shared with 
Mr B by way of explanation.  
I understand Mr B has settled the loan early, so Creation offered to pay Mr B the difference 
between what he paid in total and what the loan should have been under the restructure 
above, with 8% interest. 
But Mr B has said he settled the loan by refinancing. As our adjudicator explained, because 
Mr B has settled the loan by refinancing, and Mr B has supplied evidence of the refinance to 
Creation, I think Creation should: 
1. Refund the extra Mr B paid each month with the Creation loan.
2. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr B receives his refund.
3. Refund the extra Mr B paid with the refinanced loan.
4. Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr B receives his refund.
5. Pay Mr B the difference between the amount now owed and the amount he wouldve 
owed if the system had been self-funding
Im satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mr B first 
contacted Creation that means the claim should have been upheld and redress offered in 
line with our well-established approach (as described above). I direct that Creation should 
pay Â£100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint. Creation Consumer Finance 
Ltd should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
