Complaint
Mr P has complained about a personal loan Everyday Lending Limited (trading as Everyday 
Loans) provided to him. 
He says the loan was unaffordable and therefore should never have been provided to him in 
the first place.
Background
Everyday Loans provided Mr P with a loan for £3,500.00 in January 2020. This loan had an 
APR of 99.9% and a term of 60 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£12,918.60, including interest, fees and charges of £9,418.60, was due to be repaid in 60 
monthly instalments of just over £215. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ps complaint and he thought that Everyday Loans 
ought to have realised that it shouldnt have provided Mr P with his loan. So he thought that 
Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. 
Everyday Loans didnt accept the adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Ps complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
Everyday Loans needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is Everyday Loans needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr P could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
The information Everyday Loans has provided suggested that it carried out credit checks 
before Mr Ps loan was provided. The results of which showed that Mr P already had a 
significant amount of existing debt and had taken out loans with payday type and other high-
cost lenders. 
Im also concerned that Everyday Loans own income and expenditure calculation showed 
that this loan would take Mr P close to the margin of his disposal income. And Everyday 
Loans relied on the use of average data to calculate Mr Ps living expenses when arriving at 
its monthly disposable income figure. This is despite the fact that Mr Ps credit file showed 
he didnt fit the profile of the average borrower. 
All of this leaves me persuaded by what Mr P has said about already being in a difficult 
financial position at the time. And while its possible Mr Ps financial position reflected his 
choices rather than financial difficulty, Id add that my experience of these types of cases 
suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 
Everyday Loans, Ive been persuaded to accept Mr Ps version of events here. 
As this is the case, I do think that Mr Ps existing financial position meant that he was 
unlikely to be able to afford the repayments to this loan, without undue difficulty or borrowing 
further. 
Im therefore satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more like than not 
have shown Everyday Loans that it shouldnt have provided this loan to Mr P. As Everyday 
Loans provided Mr P with this loan, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to act fairly and 
reasonably towards him. 
Mr P ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan he shouldnt have been provided 
with. So Im satisfied that Mr P lost out because of what Everyday Loans did wrong and that 
it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what Everyday Loans needs to do to put things right for Mr P
Having thought about everything, Everyday Loans should put things right for Mr P by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr P on his loan;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr P to the date of settlement
removing any and all adverse information it may have recorded on Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Everyday Loans to take off tax from this interest. 
Everyday Loans must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he 
asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ps complaint. Everyday Lending Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2023.
