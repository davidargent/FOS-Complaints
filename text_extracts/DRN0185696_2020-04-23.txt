K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains that a hire purchase agreement with Secure Trust Bank  Plc, trading  as 
Moneyway, was misrepresented to him and about the way that it terminated the agreement.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr F under a hire purchase agreement with Moneyway 
that he signed in February  2017  it says: This is a Hire Purchase agreement  
regulated by the Consume Credit  Act 1974.  Sign it only if you want to be legally 
bound by its terms - and he agreed to make  59 monthly payments of £205.26 and a 
final payment of £215.26 for the car;
he says that the dealer knew that he would be using  the car as a taxi but the hire 
purchase agreement  that he signed says, under a heading Use of the Vehicle, that 
you  must not use it  as a taxi;
Mr F didnt make  the first payment  that was due in March 2017 so his account went  
into arrears and he missed other  payments so Moneyway sent him a default notice in 
August 2018 and terminated the agreement in September  2018   and the car has 
since been collected from him and sold at auction;
he says that he agreed  in October  2018  to pay the amount that was due and for the 
agreement to continue  but that when he told Moneyway that he was using the car as 
a taxi it said that it wouldnt be able to re-start the agreement  and he says that he 
should have been  allowed to clear  the debt and continue with the agreement;
I consider that Moneyway terminated the agreement because  of the arrears on his 
account  and the default notice and termination  notice were  sent to him because of 
those arrears  and he didnt contact it to take the action required  by the default 
notice until after the agreement had been  terminated;
Moneyway may have  been prepared to reinstate  the agreement if Mr F had paid it 
the arrears after he contacted it in October 2018  but there was no requirement for it 
to do so and when it became aware that Mr F was using the car as a taxi in breach of 
the agreement  it didnt reinstate it;
Moneyway credited  £100 to Mr Fs account  in May 2019 in recognition  of the poor 
customer service  that hed received from the dealer   but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that its acted incorrectly in its dealings  with Mr F;
I sympathise with Mr F for the difficulties  that hes experienced but there  is a 
substantial outstanding balance on his account and Im not persuaded that it would 
Ref: DRN01856962be fair or reasonable  in these circumstances for me to require Moneyway to write off 
that balance or to take any other action in response to Mr Fs complaint; and
I suggest that Mr F contacts Moneyway to agree  an affordable repayment plan for the 
outstanding amount  that he owes it  and, if hes experiencing  financial difficulties, 
its required to respond to those difficulties positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2020.
