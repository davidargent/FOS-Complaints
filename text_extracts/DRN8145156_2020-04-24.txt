K821x#15Complaint
Mr J complains Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr J took one running credit facility  (RCF) and then 24 instalment loans. Ive included  some 
of the information weve  received from Sunny about  these loans in the appendix at the end 
of this decision.
The RCF is different to the instalment loans. The RCF allowed Mr J to either request funds 
up to his agreed credit limit in one go or take multiple drawdowns up to that limit. It appears 
Mr J had a credit limit of £350.  Each  drawdown  could be repaid via five monthly instalments. 
In our latest  assessment our adjudicator thought it was wrong for Sunny to have granted  
drawdowns 11 to 19 under the RCF and all of the instalment  loans.  
Mr J has accepted what our adjudicator said. Sunny  hasnt replied to the latest  assessment. 
But, Sunny has already  accepted that something may have gone wrong when it provided 
loans 7 to 25, so it agreed to refund interest on these loans together with 8% simple interest. 
It also agreed to amend  Mr Js credit  file by removing any relevant entries to reflect its offer. 
Mr J didnt accept the offer.  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Mr J has accepted the latest adjudicators  findings. Sunny hasnt commented on the latest  
assessment with what the second adjudicator said about the lending  from 19 October 2014 
(when Mr J took his eleventh drawdown under the RCF) until 21 May 2015 (loan 6). But I 
wont be making a finding  about  loans 7 to 25 as Sunny has already accepted  something  
may have  gone  when  these were provided.  
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted the 
RCF drawdowns from 19 October  2014  and the first five instalment loans. But I have kept 
the other lending in mind when thinking  about the overall lending  relationship  between  
Sunny and Mr J. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute Sunny had to assess Mr Js situation to check if he 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do 
this in a way which was proportionate  to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks  could have 
taken into account  a number of different things,  such as how much was being  lent, the size 
of the repayments  and Mr Js income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think  in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN81451562But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr J. These factors include:
Mr J having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr J having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated  refinancing may signal that the borrowing  
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr J coming  back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr J.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr J could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr J was able to repay  his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
There was also an expectation  in October 2014, when the eleventh drawdown under the 
RCF was granted, that Sunny would review  and monitor how Mr J was using the RCF 
facility. CONC 6.7.2  says; A firm must  monitor a customers repayment record and take 
appropriate action  where there are signs of actual  or possible repayment  difficulties.  
So it wasnt  enough  for Sunny to just assess the further lending based  on what  it knew  when 
the RCF had initially been approved  in June 2014.  It also needed to monitor how Mr J was 
using the facility - and then step in and provide help when or if it could see Mr J was, or was 
likely, having financial difficulties.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Js complaint.
I can see that Mr J had a credit limit under the RCF of £350. He initially took £150 in
June 2014 which he repaid at the end of that month. The second drawdown in July 2014 of 
£200 was also repaid  at the end of the month. Shortly after this, Mr J took two more  
drawdowns bringing his borrowing to the RCF credit  limit of £350.  
Mr J then made some repayments before borrowing twice on 16 September 2014 through  
payments of £50 and £40.52. This lending increased  Mr Js indebtedness  under the RCF to 
around the level it had been following the previous months drawdowns. 
Following three repayments on 30 September 2014,  Mr J then took a series  of smaller 
repayments of £25 in quick succession.  The fifth drawdown of £25 on 19 October 2014 
returned Mr Js indebtedness to a level comparable to the position he was in following the 
drawdowns in August  2014. 
Ref: DRN81451563I think Sunny  should have  been aware  by this point (the eleventh drawdown), that Mr J 
wasnt using his account as intended or making any headway in repaying  his loan. The way 
in which  Mr J was using  the facility I think was a sign that Mr J was having  actual or possible 
repayment difficulties.  I think  its fair to say that Mr J was most likely  needing  to borrow 
further from Sunny in order  to fill a hole in his finances that was made by making  repayments  
to Sunny.  Mr J continued to drawdown  quite small amounts  in November and December  
2014 and didnt make  any real in-roads into repaying the capital he was borrowing. This isnt 
a sustainable  form of borrowing and suggests  to me that Mr J was having problems 
managing his money. 
Before the RCF was fully repaid Sunny provided  Mr J with two instalment loans of £200,  and 
then after the RCF was repaid, Mr J took another  two instalment loans of £200 each in 
consecutive months. And given the way these  loans have been  provided along with the 
amounts lent, I agree  with our adjudicator that this had the same effect as unfairly allowing 
Mr J to continue to drawdown on the RCF in a way that was unsustainable.  
In these circumstances, I dont think Sunny could have reasonably believed that Mr J would 
have been able to repay  drawdowns  on the RCF from 19 October 2014, or any further  loans 
without undue difficulty or without the need to borrow again. So I dont  think  Sunny shouldve 
allowed any further  drawdowns from this date. 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, I agree with our 
adjudicator that Sunny  should  reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided  loan 6. 
I say this because:
By loan 6 it was eleven months into the lending relationship with only one week  
where Mr J wasnt  indebted to Sunny. Mr J had taken 19 drawdowns under the RCF 
and then took 5 instalments loans. In my view, Mr Js loan history up until this point 
was a clear indication that his underlying financial  situation  didnt  seem  to be 
improving; 
Mr J took loan 4 two weeks after the RCF had ended and loan 5 was lent one week 
after repayment of loans 2, 3 and 4.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised that Mr J may have been  borrowing further  to cover 
a hole the repayment of previous loans had left in his finances and that this was 
indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
From  early  August  2014 Mr Js borrowing under the RCF was broadly consistent.  
And the first five instalment loans were all for £200.  I think its most likely this 
consistent pattern  of borrowing  over the period showed that Mr J didnt  just have a 
short-term cash-flow  problem but was probably  supporting regular living  expenses  or 
other financial commitments; 
Mr Js lending history was prolonged  with loans being taken out throughout 2015 and 
for the first five months of 2016.  Most of the loans  (ranging  between £50 and £250) 
overlapped with a broadly consistent level of indebtedness. The amount of time that 
Mr J spent indebted to Sunny  meant  that he was servicing a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period  of time.
Ref: DRN81451564I think that Mr J lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 to 25:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Js 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Js complaint about  his borrowing from the eleventh  draw down under 
the RCF (on 19 October  2014) to loan 25. And Ive set out what  Sunny should do to put 
things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on drawdowns on the RCF from
19 October 2014 as well as all interest, fees and charges applied to loans 2 to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  on Mr Js credit  file about the RCF from
19 October 2014 as well as loans 2 to 5;
remove loans 6 to 25 from Mr Js credit  file entirely, this is because the period of time 
Mr J owed Sunny money means that any information  still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Js complaint.  
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr J as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2020.
