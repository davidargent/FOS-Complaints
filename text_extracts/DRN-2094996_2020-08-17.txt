DRN-2094996
The complaint
Mr D complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called Evergreen 
Finance London Limited, trading at the time as MONEYBOAT. Mr D says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems. 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision (PD) about this case in July 2020 comprehensively setting out 
why I thought the complaint shouldnt be upheld.  And I asked both parties to provide any 
further submissions or information to me within one month. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my PD, I agreed with our adjudicator that loans 1, 2 and 3 all appeared to be relatively 
moderate sums and each well within Mr Ds capacity to pay them back. I also said that by 
loan number 4, I still couldnt say that it was wrong for MONEYBOAT to lend him the money 
in the way that it did. I set out clearly why I thought this.
Ive now reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve had no responses from either party 
with any new information or arguments that hadnt previously been made. On that basis, 
theres no reason for me to change the findings I set out in my PD. 
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint. And dont require Evergreen Finance London Limited pay 
any compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2020.
