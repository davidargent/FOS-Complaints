Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Uncle Buck shouldnt have 
approved any lending from loan 4 onwards. 
Uncle Buck  disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that:
It did decline loans between loans 3 and 4. But there was still a clear  break  in the 
lending. This also applied between loans 5 and 6. There were often smaller breaks in 
the lending. 
Uncle Buck said the checks it made were proportionate. And these checks showed 
that Mr M could afford the loan repayments.  
Nevertheless, Uncle Buck offered to write  off the remaining balance on the final loan to settle  
the complaint.  Mr M didnt  accept this offer. 
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed  to me
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
Ref: DRN26998642These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Ive decided to uphold  Mr Ms 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr M has accepted our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. Because of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making a decision  about 
this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr M had with Uncle Buck.  So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 4 to 11 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks 
lending history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if there was a point  at which  Uncle Buck  
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so Uncle  Buck  should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
4. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr M had been borrowing from Uncle  Buck for over 12 months. 
And Mr M had tried to take more loans  but Uncle Buck had not approved these. So 
Ref: DRN26998643Uncle Buck  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr M had other longer 
term financial problems rather than a need for help with his short  term cash flow 
situation 
Mr Ms first loan was for £500 and loan 4 was for £800. The amount  Mr M borrowed 
increased to £1000 shortly after this. So, this was a further reason for Uncle  Buck to 
have realised that Mr M was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need that was increasing. 
As Uncle Buck has said there were some  breaks  in the lending.  But Mr M did, at 
times, apply for other loans in these breaks. And he was borrowing significant  
amounts over a long period of time.  So I dont  think these breaks wouldve made it 
reasonable for Uncle Buck  to think Mr Ms financial situation had improved. 
Loan 11 was taken out nearly  three years after Mr Ms first. And Mr M had taken 
some large loans. Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a 
debt to Uncle Buck over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Uncle Buck  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 4  
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 11 and Uncle Buck  should  put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  4 to 11
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 11 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
If Mr M still owes Uncle Buck any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan 
Uncle Buck  should  remove all the interest  and charges  applied  to the outstanding balance.  
Uncle Buck  should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr M went  to 
towards the principal.  But importantly, Uncle  Buck needs to make  sure that Mr M doesnt  
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr M hasnt repaid the principal  he borrowed Uncle  Buck can deduct  this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr M has already paid enough  to repay  the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
And if Uncle Buck no longer owns this debt,  and it wants  to make a deduction  due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr M.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN26998644my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint.
Uncle Buck  Finance LLP should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 January 2020.
