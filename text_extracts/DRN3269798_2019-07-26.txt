K821x#15complaint
Miss S complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, was irresponsible  when 
it provided her with a number of loans.
background
I've prepared a table  showing  some  of the information CEN has provided about Miss Ss 
loans. This can be found at the end of this decision in the annex. 
This complaint is about 14 loans. Loan 1 was an open ended credit agreement, known as 
flexcredit. This was taken  in April 2014 and provided Miss S with a credit limit of £150.  It was 
settled around 11 months later  in March 2015. The following 13 loans were payday  loans 
usually repayable through 2 or 3 instalments. Loan 2 was taken on 10 April 2015 and the last 
loan (Loan 14) was taken in June 2018. 
Some of the payday loans  were  topped up with additional principal advances  before the 
original loan was repaid.  These are identified in the table through  the addition of a letter to 
the loan number. So for example, Loan  8 was topped up twice.  Those top-ups are identified 
in the table as Loans  8a and 8b.
Our adjudicator didnt  think QuickQuid acted unfairly  when it provided the flexcredit  loan or in 
the way it managed that account.  But she recommended that Miss Ss complaint about 
Loan 2 and Loans 5 to 14 should  be upheld.  This was because she thought  that had 
QuickQuid done  proportionate checks it wouldve seen that Loans  2 and 5 were  unaffordable 
for Miss S. And she concluded that the pattern of borrowing from Loan 6 onwards suggested 
that Miss S was persistently reliant on short term loans, which  was unsustainable.
QuickQuid doesnt  agree with our adjudicator so the matter has come to me - an 
ombudsman - for a decision. If Miss S accepts my decision  it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to 
ensure Miss S could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come 
a point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances  of this particular  complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same  reasons. I have thought  carefully about 
what QuickQuid has told us since it received our adjudicators recommendation. But I remain  
satisfied that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld. I explain below the reasons for my 
decision.
The credit limit for the flexcredit  account  was £150. The highest repayment in any one month 
- if Miss S drew  down the maximum  amount  - was around £56. Shed declared a monthly  
income of £750.  In these circumstances I dont think it was unreasonable for QuickQuid to 
Ref: DRN32697982provide Miss S with this credit facility. It was obliged to monitor  how she used it. In the first 
six months she did draw down principal on six occasions but after that point there  were  no 
further drawdowns. So on balance it doesnt  seem that QuickQuid acted unfairly  in relation to 
the flexcredit account. So I'm not upholding Miss Ss complaint about Loan  1.
I can see that after the last draw  down on the flexcredit, Miss S spent  the next five months 
repaying the balance. And a late fee was charged  in December 2014. Around a month after 
she cleared the flexcredit Miss S applied for Loan 2. This was for £200 and was repayable  
through three instalments   with the final one being  almost £253. She had declared to 
QuickQuid that her monthly  income  was again £750  but that her outgoings were £425. In 
other words she declared a disposable income  of £325.
In these circumstances I think that QuickQuid shouldve  been concerned about whether 
Miss S would be able to afford to repay  this loan when  the repayments  fell due. So it 
shouldve done  more to verify the information  she gave it. I've seen  Miss Ss bank 
statements. And, had QuickQuid confirmed her employment situation, it wouldve learnt that 
Miss S didnt receive  any income from February  2015 and as such  wouldnt be in a position 
to repay  Loan  2. So I uphold her complaint about  that loan.
Given that Miss S had no income it isnt surprising that she then failed to meet the terms of 
the loan agreement for Loan 2. She missed her first repayment and was charged a late fee. 
Default interest was then applied  to her balance until she repaid the loan in July. So I think 
that QuickQuid ought  to have been  concerned when Miss S applied for Loan  3 about six 
weeks later.  This was for a smaller  amount - £50 - but Miss S also declared a higher monthly 
income of £960.  Given the background I think QuickQuid should again have been  verifying  
the situation with Miss Ss income. But I can see from her bank statements that it seems she 
was back in paid employment - earning  around  £960 per month. The third and highest 
repayment on Loan 3 was due to be around £61. And from what I can see, I think that even if 
QuickQuid had done proportionate checks it wouldve been reasonable to conclude  that 
Loan 3 would be affordable for Miss S.  
I think QuickQuid shouldve continued  to have some  concerns about  Miss S returning  for a 
further loan (Loan 4) only six days after she repaid Loan 3  and it was for a higher amount. 
But - as with Loan  3 - on what I've seen, I dont think it wouldve been  wrong  for QuickQuid  
to conclude that Miss S would be able to afford  the repayments sustainably and to therefore 
provide this loan.  
So Im not upholding Miss Ss complaint about  Loans 3 and 4.
However the terms of Loan 5 meant that the highest repayment was £251 (which increased 
to £314 after the top up). And having taken account  of Miss Ss income,  normal  monthly 
expenses and her credit  commitments, I can see that she wouldnt have had sufficient  
means from which to make the repayments. In simple terms this loan wasnt  affordable for 
Miss S. And if QuickQuid had carried out proportionate checks  it wouldve been  aware  of this 
and not provided  the loan. So Im upholding her complaint about Loan  5 and its top up.
Around two weeks  after Miss S had repaid Loan 5 she came back  for Loan 6. QuickQuid 
shouldve realised that the pattern of lending had, by now, become unsustainable  for Miss S. 
Apart from some short periods shed effectively been indebted to QuickQuid for almost two 
years. And I think that it had clear  that Miss S was using her high cost short term loans from 
QuickQuid to plug holes in her finances caused,  most  likely,  by earlier loan repayments.  This 
wasnt a sustainable  situation. 
Ref: DRN32697983And Miss Ss borrowing  from that point supports this conclusion. She topped up Loan 6 and 
extended its term. I accept that there was a gap of around five months  between  Loans 6 and 
7 but given the length of time shed been  indebted  to QuickQuid I dont think it wouldve been 
reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude that her reliance on short term loans had ceased after 
this relatively short  period.  
This was confirmed when  Miss S returned  for Loan 8 seven days after she repaid Loan 7. 
She topped  up Loan 8 twice and this pattern continued. She was charged a late fee after her 
fourth top up to Loan 10 suggesting that she was indeed in financial difficulties. This 
unsustainable pattern of borrowing continued  until Loan 14 which  Miss S took on 
13 June 2018  and topped  up on the following day. She only made a single interest payment 
on this loan which is why my table shows that there  is an outstanding balance.  
So I also uphold Miss Ss complaint about Loans 6 to 14 and their top ups.
putting things  right
I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to
A.refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on Loan 2 and on the loans and top ups 
taken from and including Loan  5 to Loan  13 (as outlined  in the table in the annex)
B.pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
C.remove all interest and charges from the outstanding balance  on Loan 14 and apply 
any payments made on that loan as though they were  towards the principal sum 
borrowed. This will leave an outstanding  principal  balance on Loan 14. QuickQuid 
may offset the refund calculated at A and B against the outstanding principal balance 
on Loan 14. It should then repay  the surplus to Miss S.
D.remove adverse information from Miss Ss credit  file about Loans 2 and 5 
E.the number  of loans taken from Loan 6 (taken on 16 June 2016) onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans approved 
from this point onwards  should  be removed from Miss Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give Miss S a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
Ref: DRN32697984my final decision
For the reasons  I've explained, Im partly upholding  Miss Ss complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 August 2019.
