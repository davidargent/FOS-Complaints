K821x#15complaint
Mr W says APFIN LTD (trading as cashasap.co.uk) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 17 loans Apfin provided to Mr W between  March 2016  and 
November 2017.  All loans  except 15 and 17 were repayable in a single repayment. Loans 15 
and 17 had a three-month  term. This is a summary of Mr Ws lending  history from Apfin:

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought the loans from 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Apfin disagreed,  saying  it would make an offer on loans 8 
onwards. Mr W rejected this offer so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Apfin needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN65795912But certain factors might  point to the fact that Apfin  should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Apfin was required to establish  
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that there was nothing to indicate  Apfin  needed to do more when 
it approved loans 1 to 3. So I dont think Apfin was wrong to give loans 1 to 3 to Mr W.
However, like the adjudicator, I think by loan 4 Apfin ought to have realised  that Mr W was 
having problems  repaying his loans.  And it was likely his finances  were under pressure. I say 
this as by loan 4 he had taken out a new loan within days of repaying his previous loan three 
times. There  was no lending gap of greater than 9 days between any of the first four loans 
and I think this should have indicated to Apfin  that it was most  likely Mr W was borrowing to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances,  and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. So it should have concluded that it was unlikely 
Mr W could repay this loan  or any subsequent  loans  sustainably. It follows I think Apfin 
was wrong to give loans  4 to 6 to Mr W.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Apfins  lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Apfin should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Apfin should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Ref: DRN65795913Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
Mr Ws first loan was for £201 and loan 7 was also for £200. There had been no 
reduction in the amount Mr W was borrowing each month. At this point Apfin ought to 
have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  of settling  a 
previous one. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Apfin. Loan 17 was 
taken out 20 months after Mr Ws first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr W had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Apfin over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Apfin continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ive considered carefully Apfins response  to the adjudicators recommendation. It argued  
that based on technical guidance we have set out, only loans from 8 onwards should be 
upheld. But I disagree, and I have explained  why in my findings  in detail. In summary, based  
on the individual circumstances  of this case, I am upholding loans 4 to 6 as there  was 
evidence Mr W was struggling  to repay  his loans without having  to borrow  again. And I am 
upholding loans  7 onwards as at this stage Apfin ought to have  realised further borrowing 
was unsustainable.     
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 17 and Apfin should put things right.
putting things right  what Apfin needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 4 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 17, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr W*; 
remove any adverse information  about  loans 4 to 6 from Mr Ws credit file
the number  of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 17 should be removed from Mr Ws 
credit file.
Ref: DRN65795914 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Apfin to take off tax from this interest. Apfin must give Mr W a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. If Apfin intends to apply  the refund to 
reduce any outstanding  capital balance, it must  do so after deducting the tax.
*If after taking  these  steps Mr W still owes money on loan 17, Apfin must  treat him fairly and 
sympathetically when trying to reach any agreement on how to repay the outstanding principal due.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. APFIN LTD (trading 
as cashasap.co.uk)  should pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 January 2020.
