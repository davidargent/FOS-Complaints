DRN-3944059
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly defaulted his account 
and that it didnt do enough to contact him before doing so.
What happened
Mr D complained to NatWest after he was contacted by a third-party debt collector and later 
found that a default had been recorded against his name. Mr D had exceeded the arranged 
overdraft on his account, which led to the debt that he owed to NatWest.
NatWest says it wrote to Mr D via SMS and by post multiple times between January 2021 
and April 2021. It later transpired that the bank held an old address and telephone number 
for Mr D and was only updated of his current details after his account had defaulted. Mr D 
said the bank shouldve done more to trace his details. NatWest responded that it is Mr Ds 
responsibility to keep his details up to date. The bank concluded that it hadnt done anything 
wrong.
Remaining unhappy, Mr D asked this service to get involved. He wants NatWest to remove 
the default because it is impacting his credit worthiness. Our investigator decided that 
NatWest had acted fairly. Mr D doesnt agree, so the complaint has been passed to me for a 
final say.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided that NatWest has acted fairly. I know Mr D will be disappointed 
to hear this, so Ill explain why. 
NatWest says it wrote to Mr D multiple times to notify him of the balance he owed and later 
inform him about his account defaulting. Although NatWest could only provide us with 
template copies of most of the letters, the records it sent us show that these were sent to 
Mr D. The bank managed to provide a copy of the formal demand that was sent to Mr D in 
April 2021, and I can see this was sent to his previous address. 
Although Mr D says that no correspondence was received at his previous address, Im 
satisfied that the letters were sent and that NatWest did enough to contact him. Mr D says 
the bank shouldve sent the letters via recorded delivery, but I havent seen anything that 
persuades me this was a necessary step for the bank to have taken. 
The issue here is that all the communication sent by the bank about this was sent to an 
address Mr D no longer lived at and a telephone number that he no longer held. It is my 
understanding that the occupants of this address around the time were Mr Ds family 
members. The terms of Mr Ds account say that it is his responsibility to keep his contact 
details up to date. In my opinion, it is reasonable that this duty is placed on Mr D rather than 
NatWest, as hes best placed to identify when his contact details have changed. Moreover, I 
dont find that its fair to oblige NatWest to regularly check that its customer contact details 
are up to date. 
According to the banks records, Mr D updated his contact details in June 2021. Given the 
only details the bank held prior to this were Mr Ds previous address and telephone number, 
I think NatWest acted reasonably when it only used these details to try to contact him.
Mr D says the third-party debt collectors were able to trace him at his new address, so he 
suggests that NatWest shouldve done the same before defaulting the account. I dont agree 
 the debt collector wouldve had access to different resources as part of its remit as a debt 
collector and this is what likely helped it to track down Mr Ds new address. Its unlikely that 
NatWest has access to the relevant resources, so all it could reasonably do is try and 
contact Mr D using the details it held. Given the terms require Mr D to keep his contact 
details updated, I cant fairly expect the bank to have done more to trace him.
NatWest has a duty to ensure it reports accurate information to credit reference agencies, so 
its appropriate that the bank reported the default. The guidance from the Information 
Commissioners Office says that a default may be registered after a customer is at least 
three months behind with their payments. I can see that this was the case with the balance 
Mr D owed and it seems to me that NatWest sent Mr D the relevant default notice 
beforehand. 
I note Mr Ds comments about the correspondence being sent to a previous address, but 
given what Ive said above, Im satisfied that the bank took reasonable steps to send the 
notice to Mr D. So Im of the opinion that NatWest acted fairly when it registered the default.
For these reasons, Ive decided that NatWest did enough to try and contact Mr D before it 
defaulted his account, which Ive decided it did so fairly. So I wont be asking the bank to 
remove the default. 
My final decision
Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2023.
