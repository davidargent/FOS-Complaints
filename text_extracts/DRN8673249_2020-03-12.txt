I understand loans  10, 11 and 12 were sold to a third party and the current  status of these 
balances is unknown.
Mr J told us that Sunny ought to have known  that he could not afford  the repayments of his 
loans. He says in order to repay his loans he had to borrow further, often from other  lenders  
which resulted him in being trapped in a debt spiral.
Sunny told Mr J in its final response  that it would not uphold his complaint.  It said before it 
gave Mr J all the loans  it carried out affordability and creditworthiness  checks and its records 
showed that for each loan application, it carried  out its assessments correctly and the checks  
were proportionate and sufficient.
Our adjudicator told the parties  that she hadnt seen enough to uphold  loans 1-5. But she 
said when Sunny gave Mr J loan 6 onwards, Mr Js overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
hed become persistently reliant on short term loans.  So she upheld Mr Js complaint about 
loans 6-12.  
In response to our adjudicators view Sunny said it would  like to put forward a different 
settlement. It said it agreed that when reviewing Mr Js overall pattern of borrowing, it would 
have been prudent to ask Mr J more questions  at some point as there  had been  no 
significant breaks in lending.  But it disagreed that it should not have continued  to lend from 
loan 6 onwards.  It said that this was because  at loan 6 it was unable to see that Mr J had 
become persistently reliant on loans. However, it said that it may have been  prudent  to have 
Ref: DRN86732492done things differently after the ninth loan and it offered Mr J the sum of £692.12 from loan 
10 onwards. It also offered to remove loans 10, 11 and 12 from Mr Js credit  file.
Mr J did not accept this offer and as the parties  are not in agreement with what  our 
adjudicator said the complaint was passed  to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN86732493Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Js complaint 
about loans 6 -12.
I agree  with our adjudicator that loans 1-5 should  not be upheld. As I have explained above 
early on in the relationship, I think Sunny could rely on what Mr J told it for loans  1-4. Hed 
declared his income  as £2600 and for loans 1-4, on the face of it theres nothing to make  me 
think Mr J wouldnt  have been  able to repay  his loans  sustainably or that these loans were 
unaffordable compared with the disposable  income hed declared.  
And although Sunny could have made some further checks  when Mr J took out loan 5, Ive 
seen nothing to suggest Mr J would have had difficulty in repaying his loan at this point. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr J was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. By the time Mr J had taken out loan 6 he had been  indebted  to Sunny for 
around nine months save for some short periods in between.  And when Mr J took out 
loan 6 he still had his previous loan outstanding and borrowed more  than he had 
done for loan 5. So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr J was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Js first loan was for £600.00  and although  loan 6 was for £350 he was still 
repaying loan 5 for which  hed borrowed another £250.00. So, these amounts had 
not really decreased  and it doesnt seem  likely  Mr Js need for cash  was reducing  
which also in my view points to Mr J having  a longer term need for funds. So, at this 
point Sunny ought to have known that Mr J was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr J was provided  with a new loan whilst he was still repaying 
previous loans and Sunny has told us it had to sell the outstanding  balances for loans 
10, 11 and 12 to a third party as by this time Mr J had not made  the agreed 
repayments. 
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out just over 18 months after Mr Js first. And although this time it was for 
£100.00, loan 10 and 11 were both written  off as Mr J hadnt  repaid them.  Loan  10 
was for £600.00 and loan 11 was for £150.00. So putting  all this together  in reality 
loan 12 was for a larger amount. Mr J had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN86732494these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-12 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr J loans 6-12.
It appears that there is an outstanding balance  in respect of loans 10-12. I understand Sunny 
has sold these outstanding debts to a third party. If that is the case, it should buy these back  
if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts 
back then it should  liaise with the new debt owner  to achieve the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr J towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by Mr J 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr J originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr J as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr J having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal Sunny has 
already written-off.  If this results in a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to Mr J. 
However, if there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny should  try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr J. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mr Js borrowing for loans 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about him is adverse, so Sunny should  remove these loans entirely from Mr Js 
credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN86732495Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2020.
