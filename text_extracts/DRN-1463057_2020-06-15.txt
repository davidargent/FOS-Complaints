The complaint
Mr J says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr J says Sunny didnt carry out sufficient checks to make sure the lending was 
affordable for him. It should have been alert to the fact it was possible he was becoming 
dependent upon this type of credit. The borrowing resulted in him getting into a cycle of debt 
which has had a big impact on his life.                         
What happened
This complaint is about 36 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr J between August 2016 
and July 2017. Mr Js borrowing history for the first 15 loans is as follows:

Mr J continued borrowing from November 2016 to July 2017 and the amounts borrowed 
ranged from £50 to £350.
The first of our adjudicators to look into the complaint partially upheld it and thought the 
loans from loan five onwards shouldnt have been given as it looked likely that Mr J was 
struggling to repay the loans. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 24 which it later revised to 
loan 22. We put the offers to Mr J, but he wasnt willing to accept them. 
While the complaint was waiting to be reviewed by an ombudsman another of our 
adjudicators reviewed the complaint. They thought it should only be upheld from loan 13 
onwards because the amounts borrowed after loan three were significantly less than loans 
one to three and were low compared to Mr Js income. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr J didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to 12 shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr J had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Js case, and like the second adjudicator, I think 
that this point was reached by loan 13. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr J was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr J had taken out 13 loans within two months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr J was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Js 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Js first three loans were for £400 and then he consistently borrowed sums of £50, 
albeit several times per month until loan 13 when it increased to £100. And the 
number of times he borrowed in any one month significantly increased  11 loans 
were taken in November 2016 totalling £900. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr J was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income 
but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
From loan 13 onwards Mr J was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. And he would settle those earlier loans well before the date 
agreed at the outset, then he would return for additional borrowing. As examples 
loans 17 to 20 were repaid on 15 November 2016 only for Mr J to take loan 21 three 
days later. Loans 31 to 33 were all repaid early on 13 June 2017 and Mr J borrowed 
again the following day. This clearly suggests the borrowing was unsustainable for 
him and he was persistently reliant on this short-term lending. 
 
Mr J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 36 was 
taken out 11 months after Mr Js first. Mr J had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 13 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans which Mr J borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 13 to 36 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr J paid on 13 to 36;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
the number of loans taken from loan 13 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 13 to 36 should be removed from 
Mr Js credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
