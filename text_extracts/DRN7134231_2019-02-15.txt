K820x#14complaint
Mr G says Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mr G bought the policy in 1998 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr G disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Gs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Gs complaint because:
 I think Bank of Scotland made Mr G aware that he had a choice  about  buying the PPI, 
and that he chose to take it. 
 Bank of Scotland recommended the PPI to Mr G, and it seems to have been right for 
him based on what Ive seen  of his circumstances at the time.  
 Its possible the information Bank of Scotland gave Mr G about the PPI wasnt  as clear  
as it shouldve been. But Mr G doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the 
main things  the policy didnt cover   and based on what  I know  about his 
circumstances it looks like the policy couldve been useful to him. So I dont think  better  
information wouldve  stopped  him buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Gs comments.  But for the reasons explained above, these points 
dont change my conclusion. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2019
