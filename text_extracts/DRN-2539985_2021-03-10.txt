The complaint
Mr J complains about the way that Black Horse Limited has dealt with two additional 
payments that he made to it under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr J and Black Horse on 7 December 
2020 in which I said that I agreed with the investigator that Black Horse should make a 
payment to Mr J and explained why I considered that the amount of the payment should be 
less than the £3,774.53 that he recommended. Mr J responded to that provisional decision in 
detail so I issued a second provisional decision to Mr J and Black Horse on 3 February 2021 
in which I said as follows:
I still consider that Black Horse hasnt acted fairly and reasonably in the way that it 
dealt with Mr Js additional payments and that it would be fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances for it to refund to Mr J the interest reduction of £3,774.53. In my 
provisional decision I explained why I considered that that amount should be reduced 
by £1,041.
Mr J has provided further information about that amount. Under the hire purchase 
agreement he made 36 monthly repayments of £218.84 (a total of £7,878.24) but the 
hire purchase charges set out in the agreement were £7,078.24  a difference of 
£800. He also says that the amount of credit provided to him was £22,800 and the 
guaranteed future value of the car, as set out in the agreement, was £23,041 - a 
difference of £241 which, together with the £800, totals £1,041.
£1,041 was the amount by which the balance on his account in June 2019 exceeded 
the additional payments that hed made of £15,000  so the balance at that time was 
£16,041. Black Horse deducted excess mileage charges from that amount and paid 
£15,661.83 to Mr J in July 2019. Mr J says that the excess mileage charge was a 
payment that he made to Black Horse, not a refund given to him, so he doesnt 
understand how it can have any relevance to the amount that he should be refunded 
for overpaid interest.
Black Horse says that when the car was returned there was an excess mileage 
charge of £379.17 which was deducted from the refund made to Mr J leaving an 
amount of £15,661.83 that was paid to him. It says that a charge was also incurred 
for damage to the car but it waived the charge. Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Black Horse has acted incorrectly in the way that it dealt with 
the excess mileage charges.
Im persuaded that its more likely than not that Mr J had overpaid on his agreement 
by £1,041 so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for the interest 
reduction of £3,774.53 to be reduced by £1,041, the excess mileage charge or the 
amount of £661.83 that I referred to in my provisional decision. I find that it would be 
fair and reasonable for Black Horse to refund £3,774.53 to Mr J, with interest.
Mr J has described the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused over a 
year and half in trying to get back the money to which he was entitled and he says 
that he cant even begin to calculate the amount of time hes had to spend in letter 
writing, emails and phone calls to deal with it. I sympathise with him for the distress 
and inconvenience that hes been caused. I find that it would also be fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances for Black Horse to pay him £150 to compensate 
him for that distress and inconvenience.
So, subject to any further representations by Mr J or Black Horse, my provisional decision 
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint. Both Mr J and Black Horse have accepted 
my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Mr J and Black Horse have accepted my provisional decision, theres no need for 
me to change the conclusions that I reached in that decision.   
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Black Horse to pay to Mr J the amounts set out 
below.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Js complaint and I order Black Horse Limited to:
1. Pay £3,774.53 to Mr J.
2. Pay interest on that amount at an annual rate of 8% simple from July 2019 to the 
date of settlement.
3. Pay £150 to Mr J to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Black Horse to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to at 2 above. Black Horse must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2021.
