The complaint
M, a limited company is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc says it didnt deposit 
the amount of money in to its account that M thought it had.
M wants NatWest to refund the money it alleges is missing.
What happened
In May 2020, M deposited £1,740 into its account using the Business Quick Deposit (BQD) 
method. £250 was later debited from Ms account as NatWest said that it only counted 
£1,490. 
After M complained about the £250 debit, NatWest apologised as it didnt warn M that it was 
going to debit the money from its account. But NatWest doesnt agree that it made a mistake 
about the amount of the deposit.
NatWest says that the wallet containing Ms cash arrived sealed at the cash centre. There 
was no sign it had been tampered with.
NatWest counted £1,200 in £20 notes and £290 in £10 notes. It investigated the discrepancy 
and found no difference in tills or cash centre processing reports.
The investigator obtained copies of NatWests BQD process and checks made. He thought it 
most likely that M had deposited less than it thought.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ms complaint be upheld. As M didnt agree with this 
recommendation, the complaint has come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In cases like this, where the evidence is inconclusive, I reach my decision on the balance of 
probabilities. That means Ill look at all the available evidence and decide what I think is most 
likely to have happened.
I can fully appreciate Ms frustration with the situation. It is certain that it deposited £1,740 
and has given us evidence of cash takings to support this. On the other hand, NatWest has 
given this service evidence of the processes it uses and that it found a discrepancy of £250.
There are several possibilities. A member of NatWests staff took the money, it was lost, or it 
was never deposited.
NatWest has given us a photo of the wallet that was received by the cash centre. It doesnt 
have the customer details or cash breakdown on the outside, but it appears that the wallet 
had been sealed as the red sealing strip had been removed. 
Nobody in branch handles the cash and the cash centre says the wallet arrived folded over 
and intact. It seems unlikely that money in the wallet was either removed by staff before 
reaching the cash centre or was then lost before it was counted.
NatWest says that it counts the cash by machine. We asked whether there had been any 
reports about the person operating the machine at the time Ms money was counted. 
NatWest says that no other concerns had ever been raised about the individual concerned.
NatWest appears to have correctly followed its cash difference procedures and checked tills 
and cash reports but didnt find any discrepancy. 
This leaves the possibility that M didnt deposit as much money as it thought. I have paid 
close attention to the evidence provided by M. According to its records, M had cash takings 
of £1,740. The paying in slip says that £1,440 in £20 notes and £300 in £10 notes were paid 
in. But I dont find that this automatically means that the full amount was paid in to the bank. I 
say this as the bank doesnt count the cash when deposited  instead it goes in the sealed 
wallet to the cash centre for counting. This means it wouldnt be possible to pick up any 
discrepancy until the cash had been counted in the cash centre. 
I dont doubt Ms integrity, but the balance of evidence that I have seen doesnt suggest that 
NatWest made a mistake as there isnt any evidence of a system failure in its usual 
processes. Im satisfied that NatWest counted a total of £1,490 not £1,740. This means I 
dont consider I can require NatWest to pay M £250 as it could like.
Like the investigator, Im satisfied that NatWests apology for not informing M in advance that 
it was going to deduct the shortfall is enough. I dont require NatWest to take any further 
steps in relation to Ms complaint. Im sorry that this is likely to come as a disappointment. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2021.
