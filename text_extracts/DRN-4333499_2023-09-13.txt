The complaint
Mr S has complained that Extracover Limited trading as Zego provided a poor service when 
he contacted them to change the vehicle covered under his motor private hire insurance 
policy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr S clearly was on hold on the telephone for a long period of time to Extracover on 
at least two occasions, which I agree was unacceptable. 
But it does seem Extracover responded to him via online chats and tried to process 
the change he wanted on 21 March 2023. And they did eventually do this on           
28 March 2023. 
It doesnt seem as if Mr S contacted Extracover in between these dates.
So I think the Â£25 Extracover offered in compensation for the delays Mr S 
experienced on the telephone is reasonable. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ss complaint about Extracover Limited trading as 
Zego. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023.
