The complaint
Mrs Z complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and then closed her accounts. 
She says this caused her financial problems and upset. She wants NatWest to pay her 
compensation. 
What happened
Mrs Z had a current account and Help to Buy ISA with NatWest.
In November 2020, NatWest decided to review Mrs Zs account. Whilst it completed its 
review the bank restricted Mrs Zs access to her accounts. This meant Mrs Z wasnt able to 
use the money in them. Following its review, in December 2020, NatWest decided to close 
Mrs Zs accounts and gave her 60 days notice that she needed to make other banking 
arrangements. 
Mrs Z contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with her accounts but says 
the bank wouldnt tell her much. And didnt return her calls. Mrs Z complained to NatWest. 
She said she hadnt done anything which wouldve caused the bank to block and then close 
her accounts. She says due to the banks actions she was left without any money and wasnt 
able to open another account as at the time shed sent the paperwork, she needed to use to 
open another account away as part of a visa application she was completing. So, she says 
she lost her job and income as she didnt have an account she could use for her wages. She 
says she was caused a great deal of stress and worry by the block on her accounts and her 
mental health suffered. 
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed Mrs Zs accounts. 
The bank also said it had closed Mrs Zs account in line with the terms and conditions. 
However, it accepted it should have provided Mrs Z with better service. NatWest apologised 
for not returning Mrs Zs phone calls. Unhappy with this response Mrs Z brought her 
complaint to our service. 
Before it was investigated NatWest offered Mrs Z £100 for the inconvenience the review had 
caused, which was declined.
One of our investigators looked into Mrs Zs complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had reviewed and closed Mrs Zs account. Mrs Z disagreed. She 
says NatWest treated her unfairly and left her without funds. She wants the bank to explain 
why it blocked her accounts in the first place and said the compensation offered doesnt 
adequately reflect the impact the banks actions had on her. She wants more compensation.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill deal first with NatWests decision to block and review Mrs Zs accounts. As the 
investigator has already pointed out, NatWest have important legal and regulatory 
obligations they must meet when providing accounts to customers. Those obligations are 
ongoing and dont only apply to when an account is opened. They can broadly be 
summarised as a responsibility to protect persons from financial harm, and to prevent and 
detect financial crime.
To comply with their responsibilities, NatWest will monitor accounts for activity which 
appears unusual or out of place. And may ask its customer to provide information about 
certain transactions. Its common industry practice for firms to restrict access to an account 
to conduct a review on a customer and/or the activity on an account. And, considering the 
information I have available, I understand why NatWest carried out a review and I dont find 
their initial decision to restrict Mrs Zs accounts was unreasonable. So, whilst I appreciate 
the restriction caused Mrs Z inconvenience and was upsetting, I cant say the bank treated 
Mrs Z unfairly when it placed her accounts under review.
I understand that Mrs Z wants NatWest to explain the reason it applied the block to her 
accounts. And is upset that when she called and spoke to staff, she wasnt able to find out 
much at all about what was happening. But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what 
triggers a review of their accounts. And its under no obligation to tell Mrs Z the reasons 
behind the account block, as much as shed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything 
wrong by not giving Mrs Z this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it 
to do so.
The timing of NatWests actions was unfortunate. Mrs Z says she wasnt able to open 
another account to receive her wages as shed sent paperwork, shed need to do so away 
for a visa application she was completing at the time. So, I can understand why she found 
this whole experience with NatWest frustrating and upsetting. Mrs Z also says she lost her 
job because she couldnt open another account and is now financially out of pocket of 
around £700 per month. So, she wants NatWest to compensate her for her loss of income. 
Whilst I can appreciate Mrs Z feels aggrieved, it wouldnt be appropriate to me to award Mrs 
Z compensation for this since I dont think the bank acted inappropriately when it blocked 
and reviewed her accounts. And I cant hold NatWest responsible for Mrs Z not being in 
possession of the paperwork she says she needed to open another bank account. 
I can see that it took NatWest around six weeks to complete its review and remove the 
blocks from Mrs Zs accounts. But I dont consider that it would be right for me to conclude it 
should not have taken in excess of any particular or specific timeframe. Because NatWest 
was entitled  as a matter of principle  to do what it did. From looking at the timeframe and 
NatWests records, I can also see that NatWest were actively progressing its review and 
didnt cause any unreasonable delays in doing so. Once it had completed its review it also 
promptly released Mrs Zs balance to her.
I then turn to NatWests decision to close Mrs Zs account. Its generally for financial 
businesses to decide whether or not they want to provide, or to continue to provide, banking 
facilities to any particular customer. Unless theres a very good reason to do so, this service 
wont usually say that they must keep a customer or compensate a customer who has had 
their account closed. Having looked at all the evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest was  
within its rights to close Mrs Zs accounts and did so line with the account terms and relevant 
regulations. NatWest also wasnt obliged to provide Mrs Z with an explanation for why it no 
longer wanted her as a customer. So, I cant say NatWest have done anything wrong when it 
closed Mrs Zs accounts.I know Mrs Z is upset that she wasnt able to take advantage of NatWests account switching 
service when the bank closed her account. And shes said she had to take the trouble of 
manually moving her account to another bank. But under the terms of Mrs Zs she wasnt 
able to take advantage of this service because the bank had closed her account. So, I cant 
say the bank treated Mrs Z unfairly in declining her the use of this facility. 
In summary, its clearly caused Mrs Z inconvenience when she wasnt able to use her 
accounts. So understandably shes upset. And I appreciate it must have been a worrying 
and frustrating time for her. So, I realise she will be disappointed by my decision. But having 
looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, I wont be telling NatWest to 
do anything else to resolve Mrs Zs complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained Im not going to ask National Westminster Bank Plc to do 
anything more to resolve Mrs Zs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
