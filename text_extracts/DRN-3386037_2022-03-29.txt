The complaint
Ms C complains about National Westminster Bank PLCs (NatWest) decision to decline an 
application to port her mortgage.
What happened
Ms C had a mortgage with NatWest which she took in 2018. The mortgage had an interest 
rate which was fixed for five years. It also had an early repayment charge (ERC) which 
would be charged if she repaid the mortgage within the fixed rate period.
In 2020, Ms C spoke to NatWest as she wanted to move house. She completed an 
affordability assessment with NatWest but was told a full application would likely be declined. 
Ms C wasnt happy with this. She said her income had increased since shed first taken the 
mortgage and she had an excellent credit history. 
Ms C sold her property and incurred an ERC. She complained to NatWest saying that it 
hadnt given a reason for the mortgage porting application being declined. She asked that it 
refund the ERC. 
NatWest didnt uphold Ms Cs complaint, so she referred it to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into it. He was satisfied that there was no obligation for NatWest to 
agree to port the mortgage and that it wasnt required to explain the exact reasons why it 
wouldnt do so. 
Ms C didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. So, its 
been passed to me to consider and make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The original mortgage Ms C took in 2018 had an early repayment charge if she repaid it 
within the first five years which was clearly set out in the mortgage offer. Ms C repaid the 
mortgage in 2020. So, Im satisfied NatWest was entitled to apply the ERC and its done so 
in line with the original mortgage offer. 
However, Ms C has said she wanted to port the mortgage to another property which 
wouldve meant she wouldnt have incurred the ERC, but NatWest wasnt willing to port her 
mortgage. So, Ive gone on to consider whether NatWest has treated Ms C fairly when she 
tried to port her mortgage. 
It's generally down to a business to decide who it does and doesnt lend to. And lenders are 
entitled to decide their lending criteria. This can change as a lenders appetite for risk 
changes. I can see Ms C asked NatWest if she could port her mortgage to a new property to 
avoid the ERC in late 2020. NatWest completed an initial assessment to see if this was 
something she would likely be able to do. Unfortunately, the initial assessment said Ms C 
would unlikely be successful in an application.
Ive listened to the call between Ms C and NatWest when this initial assessment was 
completed. Its clear that both Ms C and the NatWest advisor were surprised that the 
outcome indicated an application wouldnt be successful. And the advisor wasnt able to 
explain why this was the case.
Because it was only an initial enquiry, NatWest isnt able to tell us the exact reason why it 
suggested this mortgage application would likely be declined. Lenders will take into account 
a number of factors when deciding who to lend to and how much to lend. I have considered 
what Ms C has said about the fact that her credit record was excellent, and her salary had 
significantly increased since shed originally taken the mortgage. Of course, these factors 
would be considered in her favour. 
However, there are other factors as well which a lender will consider. Whats significant in 
this case is that Ms C was looking to increase her borrowing substantially  almost doubling 
her mortgage amount. And, whilst she was putting in a deposit to the new property, it 
wouldve meant that the new property had less equity than the old one. This, combined with 
the increased property value, would have the effect of increasing the loan to value on the 
new mortgage which would further increase the risk to NatWest. I also note that the copy of 
the credit file Ms C has provided to us shows there are a number of credit searches carried 
by other lenders the month before she spoke with NatWest. Multiple searches such as this 
will typically affect an ability to be accepted for borrowing. 
Whilst I understand Ms Cs frustration in not knowing the exact reason she couldnt port her 
mortgage, the factors Ive listed above wouldve all likely been taken into account when 
NatWest conducted its initial assessment. And NatWest doesnt have to tell Ms C the 
specific reasons why it wouldnt be able to lend in this instance. Lenders have a 
responsibility to lend in an affordable manner. As part of lending responsibly, a lender has to 
conduct an assessment to make sure any new borrowing is affordable to a consumer. It 
seems most likely to me that, when all of the factors listed above were considered, Ms C 
didnt pass NatWests affordability assessment. 
Ms C didnt actually submit a full application to NatWest. This is understandable given shed 
been told it would likely be declined following the initial assessment. Ultimately, NatWest 
gave Ms C an indication that her application wouldnt be successful. Ive explained the 
reasons why I think this was likely the case. And the factors Ive listed are all things NatWest 
is entitled to consider when deciding whether to lend. Ultimately, the decision of whether to 
lend is one for NatWest. Ms C decided to proceed with selling her house in the knowledge 
she wouldnt be able to port her mortgage and would incur an ERC. And the ERC was 
something she agreed to when she took the original mortgage.
I recognise that Ms C will remain unhappy with not knowing the exact reason why her 
mortgage application wouldnt be successful. But, for the reasons set out above, this is a 
decision NatWest was entitled to make. So, Im not going to ask it to refund the ERC.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
