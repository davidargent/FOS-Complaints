Mr R raised a fraud claim with Revolut on 10 October 2022, asking them to refund him. 
Revolut investigated but declined to refund Mr R, saying that he was shown a warning when 
he made the payments and that no funds could be recovered from the beneficiarys account. 
However, Revolut offered to make a goodwill gesture and refunded USD450.
Mr R wasnt happy with Revoluts response, so he brought a complaint to our service.
An investigator considered Mr Rs complaint but didnt uphold it. The investigator explained 
that the payments werent covered by the Lending Standards Boards Contingent 
Reimbursement Model Code (the CRM Code), and they didnt consider them unusual or out 
of character so wouldnt have expected Revolut to intervene before processing them.
Mr R disagreed with the investigators opinion, saying such a high number of payments 
made in a short period of time shouldve been concerning for Revolut.
As the case couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me for a decision.
Having reviewed the case, I intended to reach the same overall answer as the investigator 
but for different reasons. So, I wrote to Mr R and Revolut to let them know my reasoning and 
asked for any further evidence or comments they wanted me to consider before issuing a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that Revolut is expected to process payments 
that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
customers account and the Payment Services Regulations (PSRs).
Revolut arent a signatory to the Lending Standards Boards Contingent Reimbursement 
Code (the CRM Code), so I cant apply it to the payments Mr R made.
Having carefully considered all of the evidence, Im not satisfied that I can fairly ask Revolut 
to refund Mr R, and Ill explain why.
Having reviewed the messages and screen shots that Mr R has shared, Im not satisfied that 
there is sufficient evidence to say he was the victim of a scam.
I say this because the messages weve seen only mention the last payment of USD318. 
There is no explanation of what reason was given as to why B wanted each of the payments, 
or what agreement was made between Mr R and B for each of the payments he made. Also, 
there is no evidence that B asked to borrow money then refused to repay it.
A scam is a situation where the consumer is tricked into making a payment to someone 
under false pretences or tricked into making a payment to someone other than the person 
they'd expected to pay. And I cant safely say that this is the situation in this case, based on 
the evidence weve been given. When I wrote to Mr R on 16 October 2023, I gave him the 
opportunity to provide more of the messages between him and B, however he hasnt 
provided any further evidence.
Mr R has raised concerns about the number of payments he made and Revolut not 
becoming concerned and intervening. However even if Revolut had identified a potential 
scam risk with the payments  Im not convinced that intervention by Revolut wouldve made 
a difference.
If Revolut had intervened and contacted Mr R about the payments, I think its most likely that 
he wouldve told Revolut that he was sending money to a friend. And, based on the current 
evidence, I cant say that Revolut wouldve or couldve uncovered any information that 
shouldve resulted in them refusing to follow Mr Rs payment instructions.So, having carefully considered everything weve got Im not satisfied I can fairly hold 
Revolut liable or ask them to refund Mr R. On that basis, the goodwill gesture Revolut have 
already made of USD450, is more than I wouldve recommended.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this case against Revolut Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
