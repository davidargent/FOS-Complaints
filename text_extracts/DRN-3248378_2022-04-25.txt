The complaint
Mr M complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Blue Motor Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with Blue Motor Finance 
that he electronically signed in January 2019. The cars engine control unit failed in January 
2021 due to water ingress. The manufacturer had issued a technical bulletin about the issue 
and Mr M complained to Blue Motor Finance. It said that there were no outstanding actions 
for the car and that there was no evidence that the current fault was there or developing 
when the car was supplied to Mr M. Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to 
this service. He paid for the required repairs to the car in June 2021.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
there was any conclusive evidence to suggest that the fault that Mr M experienced was 
present or developing when the car was supplied to him so he couldnt say that it was of 
unsatisfactory quality at that time.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
the mileage and age of the car arent relevant to the fault which is a manufacturing 
fault which doesnt appear straight away and can develop over time - and isnt due to 
wear and tear;
the manufacturer issued a technical bulletin about the fault so admits its present 
which should be enough evidence that the fault was present prior to the car being 
supplied to him and the dealer should have been aware of it; and
the fault wouldnt have appeared on an MOT test as the place where the fault was 
present wouldnt be seen unless part of the car was disassembled.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Blue Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr M was about five years old, had been driven for about 
75,000 miles and had a price of £14,503;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Mr M in January 2019 and it passed an MOT test in February 
2019 when its mileage was recorded as 74,443; 
he says that the cars engine control unit failed in January 2021 due to water ingress 
and he was quoted £1,605.15 in February 2021 for the required repairs  the cars 
mileage is recorded on the quote as 97,094 so, in the two years that hed had the 
car, it had been driven for more than 22,000 miles;
the manufacturer has issued a technical bulletin about the issue which describes the 
work required to fix it and which says that normal warranty procedures apply;
Mr M complained to Blue Motor Finance about the fault but it didnt agree to pay for 
the car to be repaired and Mr M then paid for the required repairs in June 2021;
he claims a total of between £2,500 and £3,000 from Blue Motor Finance for the cost 
of the repairs, diagnostics, a new battery and a courtesy car and a refund of his 
monthly payments for the time when he was unable to use the car  and he also says 
that he wants to return the car and end the agreement;
although the manufacturer has issued a technical bulletin about the fault, I dont 
consider that to be enough to show that there was a manufacturing fault with the car 
or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M;
the car was about seven years old when the fault developed and it had been driven 
for more than 97,000 miles  and it had also passed MOT tests in January 2020 and 
January 2021;
I dont consider it to be likely that Mr M would have been able to drive the car for 
more than 22,000 miles over two years if it hadnt been of satisfactory quality when it 
was supplied to him  and, if there had been a fault with the engine control unit when 
the car was supplied to him, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect the fault 
to have been identified much sooner;
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with the car and the repair (and 
other) costs that hes incurred  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Blue Motor Finance to reimburse Mr M for any of the costs that hes incurred, to allow 
him to reject the car and end the agreement, to pay him any other compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2022.
