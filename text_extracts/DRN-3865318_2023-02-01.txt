The complaint
Mr V complains that Santander UK Plc wont allow him to increase the amount of his monthly 
direct debit loan repayment.  
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, I agree with the outcome reached by our investigator for 
these reasons: 
Mr V holds a fixed sum loan. The terms of the loan state that You must pay the Total 
Amount Payable by 60 monthly repayments. 
Santander have confirmed that it is possible for Mr V to overpay the loan, but not by 
increasing his direct debit.
They have explained that to make an overpayment, Mr V can make a card payment 
by phone, visit a branch to pay by cash or cheque, send a cheque by post, or pay by 
bank transfer. I find these options fair and reasonable. 
Once an overpayment is made, the monthly instalments are then re-calculated to 
create a new payable amount. 
While I fully understand that increasing his direct debit would make things easier and 
more convenient for Mr V, it isnt something I can ask Santander to do as its not a 
service they offer. 
I know Mr V will find this disappointing, but I hope my reasoning explains why Im not 
able to give him the outcome he hoped for. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2023.
