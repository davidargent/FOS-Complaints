The complaint
Mrs B complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs B and her husband entered into a purchase agreement for a timeshare points allocation 
in February 2008 to increase their timeshare holding. Mrs B also entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the allocation. The loan agreement 
was for a loan of £11,444.21 plus a document fee of £65 and seems to have included a 
consolidation of a previous loan of to a third party which they paid under another purchase 
agreement.
Mrs Bs representative made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2018 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. Barclays Partner Finance responded to 
those claims in January 2019 and set out in detail the reasons that the claims shouldnt be 
upheld which included that: the timeshare wasnt mis-sold, the commission that it paid to the 
timeshare company didnt make the relationship unfair, and Mrs B was out of time to make a 
complaint. Mrs B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
The complaint says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the timeshare 
company which wasnt declared to Mrs B; a proper assessment of Mrs Bs ability to afford 
the loan wasnt conducted; the timeshare company unduly pressured Mrs B into entering the 
contract and the loan agreement; the timeshare was misrepresented to Mrs B; and the 
timeshare company used aggressive commercial practices to pressure Mrs B; all rendering 
the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A  and it said that the complaint should also 
be considered under section 75 of that Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Mrs Bs claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so he thought 
that Barclays Partner Finances decision was fair. He also said that he hadnt seen anything 
that would suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs B.
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
theres no statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act 
or for asking this service to look into a refusal by a creditor to properly investigate a 
complaint and the time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
the claim isnt time-barred and Mrs B only discovered the actual characteristics of the 
timeshare many years after she bought it including the near perpetual length of the 
contract and the unlimited liability for management charges which were concealed at 
the point of purchase and are unduly onerous terms so the limitation period is 
postponed until she could be aware of the facts with reasonable diligence by sections 
32(1)(b) and 32(2) of the Limitation Act;
Mrs B became aware that she had cause for complaint in June 2018 when she 
sought advice on this matter for the first time and thats the date of knowledge for the 
purposes of the six-year limitation period;
there was an unfair creditor-debtor relationship and the existence and the amount of 
commission paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company were 
concealed from Mrs B and the limitation period for a claim under section 140A is 
postponed until she could be aware of these facts; and
the loan has all the hallmarks of an unaffordable loan and no affordability checks or 
proof of income were carried out. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Bs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down her Consumer Credit 
Act claims under the Limitation Act and her representative says that theres no 
statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act and the 
time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
I accept that Mrs B has referred her complaint to this service within six years of the 
event that shes complained about  which is the turning down of her claims under 
the Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance 
has acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to her claims and the other 
reasons that its given for not upholding her claims;
Mrs Bs claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Bs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to her and 
that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to her;
in making a claim under the Consumer Credit Act, Mrs B is seeking a legal remedy, 
so if Barclays Partner Finance turned down her initial claim, she would be able to ask 
a court to consider it or ask our service to assess if Barclays Partner Finance had 
acted fairly  but that means that Barclays Partner Finance is able to consider any 
legal defence it may have to her claims, whether or not Mrs B subsequently decided 
to take her claim to court - so although the Consumer Credit Act doesnt contain any 
explicit time limits within the body of the legislation, Im satisfied that the Limitation 
Act does apply in the way it does to all legal claims;if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs B could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that induced her into buying the 
timeshare soon after she entered into the purchase agreement in February 2008 as 
that was when she entered into an agreement based on the alleged 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as she entered into 
the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at about that time, so she would have had 
six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but she didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
December 2018, which was nearly ten years later so was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act;
Mrs Bs representative says that Mrs B only became aware that she could make a 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance after she sought advice from it in June 2018  but 
when she had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs Bs 
claims;
Mrs Bs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mrs B entered into the loan agreement in February 2008 and Barclays Partner 
Finance says that it was settled in February 2010 but Mrs Bs representative says 
that the loan wasnt paid off until March 2018;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the loan was settled in 
February 2010 by a cheque payment of £10,397.56 so I consider that Mrs B would 
have needed to make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of 
February 2010  but she didnt make a claim to it until December 2018, nearly eight 
years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mrs Bs representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mrs B and that she didnt discover the 
concealment until after shed sought advice from it in June 2018;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mrs B and her representative have set out what they say happened before Mrs B 
entered into the purchase agreement and loan agreement in February 2008  but I 
dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information, in fact many of the things that they say 
werent right would have been known to Mrs B at the time of the sale so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Mrs Bs representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told 
her about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the 
loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if 
any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mrs B risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mrs Bs representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs B and that no 
affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to her;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs B and 
she didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or 
ask it for any information about the affordability assessment until December 2018  
as the loan was made in February 2008 and was repaid in February 2010, I consider 
it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loan 
would now be time barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs B was unduly 
pressured into entering into the purchase agreement or loan agreement in February 
2008 or that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices 
against Mrs B  she didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues 
until December 2018  more than ten years after shed entered into the agreements 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have complained to 
Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mrs B says that she and her husband bought a timeshare in February 2003 and they 
increased their points allocation in February 2008  and shes described the issues 
that she had with the sales practices that were used in February 2003 - if she 
considered that she was unduly pressured into entering into the agreements in 
February 2003 or that unacceptable commercial practices had been used, I consider 
it to be unlikely that shed have then entered into the purchase agreement in 
February 2008;
Barclays Partner Finance issued a detailed response to Mrs Bs claim in January 
2019 and I consider that its response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances; and 
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that shes had with her timeshare and the 
difficulties that shes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any 
of the money that she paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
