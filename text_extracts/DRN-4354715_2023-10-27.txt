The complaint
Mr G complained because National Westminster Bank Plc refused to refund him for 
payments which he said hed made because someone had blackmailed him.
What happened
On 17 May 2023, Mr G made two payments from his NatWest credit card.  One was for £100 
and the other for £200, and they went to an intermediary money transfer company. As part of 
the authorisation process, NatWest sent a text to Mr Gs registered number, to check 
whether or not the transactions were genuine. Mr G confirmed that they were. On 26 May, 
he made another payment, this time for £500.
On 28 May, Mr G rang NatWest. He said hed been the victim of blackmail. Hed exchanged 
images online with someone, and then the blackmailer had told Mr G that hed have to pay 
to have them deleted. Mr G had then made the three payments totalling £800. 
NatWest blocked Mr Gs card to prevent any further payments, and advised him to contact 
the police and Action Fraud, which he did. But NatWest didnt agree to refund Mr G for the 
£800 hed sent to the blackmailer. Mr G complained. He said that he wanted a refund, and 
he was also unhappy that during a call to NatWest on 5 June, the call had dropped after hed 
been on hold for half an hour.
In NatWests final response to Mr Gs complaint, it said that:
- it had credited Mr Gs credit card with £50 as an apology for the service provided in 
relation to the dropped call; 
- as Mr G had carried out the payments himself, it didnt count as fraud. So NatWest 
wouldnt refund him.
Mr G wasnt satisfied and contacted this service. He wanted a refund of the £800 plus the 
associated £9 cash fees. He said his mental health had been affected because of the 
financial loss, and because of the stress of telling the bank about what had happened. He 
said hed lost trust in the bank to use its commercial clout to stop this blackmail.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. She said she understood that Mr G had 
been through a very difficult time. But she explained that the regulations say that a payment 
is authorised if the payer has consented to it. And Mr G had instructed NatWest to make the 
payments. So NatWest didnt have to refund him.
Mr G wasnt satisfied. He said he wanted some form of goodwill gesture from NatWest, as 
hed been with them for a long time. He said he accepted the compensation they offered for 
dropping the call, but thought NatWest could have done more. Mr G asked for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I recognise that Mr G has had a stressful experience being blackmailed, and Im sorry to 
hear that. But the role of this service is to assess what happened, in the light of the 
regulations, and to decide whats fair and reasonable.
There are regulations which govern disputed transactions. The relevant regulations here are 
the Payment Services Regulations 2017. In general terms, the bank is liable if the customer 
didnt authorise the payments, and the customer is liable if they did authorise them. 
Here, its not disputed that Mr G instructed NatWest to make the payments, and the 
technical evidence shows that. And NatWest also sent a text to Mr G at the time of the first 
payment on 17 May to check whether he was genuinely authorising the payment. Mr G 
confirmed that it was genuine. So NatWest couldnt have known that Mr G was being 
blackmailed at the time the payments went through, because he didnt tell them. So it 
wouldnt be reasonable to expect NatWest to have blocked the outgoing payments, which Mr 
G had authorised.
Under the regulations, the fact that Mr G authorised all three payments means that hes 
liable for them. So NatWest doesnt have to refund Mr G for the payments.
 
Mr G told our investigator that he accepted the £50 compensation which NatWest had paid 
him for dropping the call, but he wanted NatWest to have done more, because hed been 
with the bank a long time. Ive considered Mr Gs request. But apart from dropping a phone 
call, I havent found that NatWest did anything wrong. Mr G authorised the payments and 
NatWest paid them as hed instructed. 
I recognise that Mr G was stressed and upset, but ultimately that was caused by the 
blackmailer, not by NatWest. However sympathetic NatWest might have been to Mr Gs 
misfortune, it didnt have any duty to refund him for the transactions out of sympathy. I 
consider that the £50 compensation for dropping the call was more than fair, so I dont 
require NatWest to pay Mr G more.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2023.
