Mr M has said it wasnt responsible for Cash On Go to lend to him as it should have realised 
the number loans he had and known  he was in debt. Cash  On Go has said it wasnt  wrong  to 
lend as it carried out the appropriate checks before lending. 
In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought  the 
loans 1 to 3 shouldnt have been  given but that loans 4 to 7 were ok.  Cash On Go agreed 
with our adjudicators  assessment on loans 1 to 3 and made  an offer. However,  Mr M 
disagreed and said loans 4 to 7 should  also be upheld. So the complaint has been passed to 
me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash On Go needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cash On Go should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN62808772the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash  On Go was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Cash on Go has agreed with our adjudicators assessment on loans 1 to 3. So I wont be 
commenting on them any further in my decision. What I will explain is why I think  Cash  On 
Go were not wrong  to provide loans 4 to 7 to Mr M. 
Loan 4 was taken out 16 months after loan 3 was repaid and because of the gap, it would 
not be unreasonable for Mr M to be considered  similarly to a new customer. 
Before lending to Mr M, Cash On Go asked  him for details of his income and normal 
expenditure. Cash On Go also did a credit check.  I havent seen the full results of the credit  
checks for loans 4 to 7, but Cash On Go has said that the results didnt cause any concerns 
or any reason  why the loans should not be provided.  From  looking at the credit  file Mr M 
provided, there werent any adverse entries like defaults or county  court judgements (CCJs)  
recorded for the time loans  4 to 7 were  taken. Although I can see some  arrears,  these arent  
significant enough that Cash  on Go shouldnt have lent to Mr M, or that its checks werent 
proportionate. 
The repayments that Mr M needed to make on the loans  appeared to be affordable after 
considering what  he said about his expenditure. So given Mr Ms repayment amounts and 
what was apparent about his circumstances at the time, I dont think  it wouldve been 
proportionate for Peachy to ask him for the amount  of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable.  
Ref: DRN62808773I appreciate that Mr M now says he was in the worst  financial position when he asked  for 
loans 4 to 7. But that wasnt something he told Cash On Go at the time.  And there wasnt  
anything in the information Mr M provided  or the information Cash On Go shouldve been  
aware of, which  meant it wouldve been  proportionate to start verifying what he was saying. 
So I dont  think Cash On Go was wrong  to give loans 4 to 7 to Mr M.
I appreciate that my findings  are likely  to disappoint Mr M but I hope my explanation will help 
him understand why Ive reached this conclusion.
putting things right  what Cash  On Go needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  1 to 3;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 3 from Mr Ms credit  file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash On Go to take off tax from this interest. Cash On 
Go must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Cash On Go Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 February  2020.
