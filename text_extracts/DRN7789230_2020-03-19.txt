Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Our adjudicator  thought Mr C had become  persistently 
reliant on short-term loans and at loan six, Mr C had taken six loans in four months, and hed 
taken the borrowing in quick succession. Our adjudicator said Mr C should be repaid any 
interest and charges and that all information  about his borrowing from loan six was adverse 
so this should be removed from his credit  file. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold Mr Cs complaint from loan 14 onwards. Mr C didn't 
accept this. Sunny later offered  to uphold the complaint from loan 11, but again, Mr C wasnt 
happy with the offer.
Another of our adjudicators reviewed the complaint before it was passed to me. He thought  
the complaint  should be upheld at loan five rather than six. And he also didn't think all 
information about Mr Cs borrowing  from loan six was adverse  and should  be removed. 
Ref: DRN77892302Instead he thought all information about Mr Cs borrowing from loan eight should be 
removed. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a Sunny should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably  
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr C didnt comment on the second  adjudicators opinion  that loans one to four shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
Ref: DRN77892303So I wont  be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr C had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account  when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I think that by loan five Sunny should have done  more to build a picture of Mr Cs financial 
circumstances. If it had done so it would have  seen that Mr C was using gambling websites 
on a regular basis so it should have questioned whether Mr C was in control of his finances 
and if should have allowed him to borrow any further. 
The monthly amount  Mr C was borrowing was increasing. In April he had taken three  loans 
totalling £750 and a further two loans in June. And the second  loan in June, loan five, meant 
he had borrowed a total of £800 in that month.
Mr C was taken concurrent loans  where earlier ones  hadnt been repaid  which  increased 
his monthly loan repayments. And he was repaying his loans earlier  before the loan term 
end date. While this would have saved in interest charges, it could equally be an indication 
that Mr C wasnt managing his money  and was juggling  his finances by taking further 
borrowing to repay  current debts.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out eight loans within four months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Cs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr C continued with his pattern of frequently returning for more  borrowing. As 
examples, loan 12 was repaid on 23 June and loan 15 was taken  three days later.  
Loan 14 was taken one day after loan 13 was repaid. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  20  was  
taken out 20 months after Mr Cs first. Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN77892304the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans five onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on five to 20;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five to seven  from Mr Cs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans eight  to 20 should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2020.
