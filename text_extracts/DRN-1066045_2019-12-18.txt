Complaint
Mr N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt make it clear that his 
contents insurance cover had a valuables limit of £15,000.
Background
In 2003, Mr N took out the policy with NatWest and it renewed each year. In 2018, he made 
a claim to the insurer following a burglary at his home. Part of his claim was for jewellery that 
was valued at over £30,000. As the policy had a valuables limit of £15,000, the insurer didnt 
cover the full value of the stolen jewellery and instead only paid the policy limit. 
Mr N complained to NatWest about the sale of the policy. He said NatWest didnt tell him 
there was a limit of £15,000 for valuables. 
NatWest didnt uphold Mr Ns complaint, so he brought the matter to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He acknowledged that NatWest 
didnt specifically bring the valuables limit to Mr Ns attention when the policy was renewed 
over the phone. However, he thought the limit was made clear in both the policy terms and 
the schedule that were sent to Mr N. 
Mr N didnt accept our investigators findings, so the matter has been passed to me. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Businesses are required to provide sufficient information about an insurance policy at the 
time of sale, so that a customer can make an informed choice about whether or not the 
policy meets their needs. That includes making the customer aware about the main 
exclusions and limitations of a policy. I therefore need to decide whether NatWest gave Mr N 
clear information about the policys valuables limit when it renewed.
NatWest spoke to Mr N over the phone when the policy was renewed. I havent listened to 
this call, but its not in dispute that NatWest didnt specifically bring the valuables limit to Mr 
Ns attention during the call. However, as I understand it, Mr N didnt make NatWest aware 
that he owned valuable jewellery, so there was no reason for NatWest to think he had 
valuables above the policy limit. 
DRN-1066045NatWest has provided a copy of its standard renewal documents. The cover letter asks the 
insured to review their cover. The documents include the policy schedule, which clearly sets 
out the valuables limit. 
I think its reasonable to expect a customer to check that a policy meets their needs if there 
are certain items that they need cover for. In providing the policy schedule to Mr N at 
renewal, and the fact that the valuables limit was included in this document, I think the 
valuables limit was made clear to Mr N. 
Consequently, I think NatWest provided sufficient information to Mr N in order for him to 
make an informed decision about the policy. I therefore dont find that the policy was mis-
sold. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2020.
