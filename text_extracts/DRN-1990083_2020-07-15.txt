The complaint
Miss B complained that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat.co.uk) acted irresponsibly when it gave her unaffordable loans.
What happened
Miss B took out two MoneyBoat loans in February and July 2019. 
Heres a table showing more information:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Highest Repayment
1 04/02/2019 31/05/2019 4 £400.00 £152.26
2 08/07/2019 31/12/2019 6 £600.00 £178.33
Miss B said that her credit report wouldve shown her other short term borrowing and she felt 
that MoneyBoat shouldnt have given her the second loan. She told us she was borrowing 
elsewhere to pay her MoneyBoat loans and she was struggling to manage her money each 
month.
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Miss B and MoneyBoat told us about these loans. 
Overall, our adjudicator thought that given the loan amounts, what was apparent about 
Miss Bs circumstances and her history with the lender, it wouldnt have been proportionate 
for MoneyBoat to ask Miss B for the amount of information needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable. And our adjudicator didn't think that the number of loans Miss B had taken 
out, the amounts shed borrowed or the length of time shed been borrowing from 
MoneyBoat shouldve alerted MoneyBoat to think she was having money problems. So he 
didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint. 
Miss B disagreed with our adjudicators view. Miss B mainly felt that MoneyBoat 
couldve seen the lending wasnt sustainably affordable for her and she mentioned other 
successful claims shed made about irresponsible lending that had been upheld. 
So the complaint comes to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Ive used this approach to help me decide this complaint.
MoneyBoat provided Miss B with high-interest loans intended for short-term use. So 
MoneyBoat needed to make sure that it didnt provide them irresponsibly. 
MoneyBoat was required to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand whether 
any lending was sustainable for Miss B before providing it. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. 
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much information it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early 
stages of a lending relationship. 
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the 
amount lent was high. 
And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of it becoming 
unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect a lender to 
be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly. 
Having carefully thought about everything Ive seen and been told, Im not upholding 
Miss Bs complaint. Heres why I say this.
MoneyBoat says it agreed to Miss Bs applications after carrying out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks. And it relied on information Miss B provided about her monthly income 
and expenditure as well as information obtained from credit reference agencies. 
It says the information it had about Miss B showed that both loans were affordable for her. 
Although Miss B has mainly complained about loan 2, I've thought about each loan in turn.
loan 1
I dont think MoneyBoat was wrong to lend Miss B loan 1. 
This was her first loan with MoneyBoat so Miss B didn't have any track record with the 
lender that shouldve alerted MoneyBoat to any underlying money problems. The information 
MoneyBoat had gathered about Miss Bs finances suggested that she was well able to afford 
this borrowing. 
I cant see that there was anything in the information Miss B provided or the other 
information MoneyBoat had recorded, including its credit checks, which meant that 
MoneyBoat shouldve taken steps to check the information Miss B had declared. 
So I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint about loan 1.
loan 2
I can see that Miss Bs second loan was for half as much again as shed borrowed first time. 
But it had been more than a whole month since shed paid loan 1 and I dont think the size of 
the loan was enough on its own to make MoneyBoat think that it shouldnt have continued to 
lend to Miss B. MoneyBoat asked Miss B to update the information she provided about her finances each 
time she applied for a new loan and the loan repayments still appeared to be affordable for 
Miss B. It looked like shed been able to pay her first loan without difficulty.
So I don't think there was anything to make MoneyBoat think that Miss B would find it hard to 
manage the loan repayments on loan 2. 
In particular, there wasnt anything I can see in the credit check information that MoneyBoat 
could see that wouldve made it think that she wouldnt be able to afford the repayments for 
loan 2 in a sustainable way. 
So I cant fairly say that I've seen enough to be able to uphold Miss Bs complaint about 
loan 2.
Looked at overall, thinking about the amount of the total monthly repayments she had to 
make for each of her loans, the questions MoneyBoat asked Miss B and keeping in mind 
that these were Miss Bs first two loans with MoneyBoat, I dont think it was unreasonable for 
MoneyBoat to rely on the level of information Miss B was providing. 
Im sorry that Miss B found repaying these loans difficult. 
And I can appreciate Miss Bs concern that her financial situation wasnt fully reflected either 
in the information she provided or the other information MoneyBoat obtained. I understand 
that Miss B feels that MoneyBoat didn't do all the checks she thinks it shouldve done before 
agreeing to lend to her or take properly into account what it could see about her financial 
situation. 
But MoneyBoats lending decisions dont seem unreasonable to me based on the 
information it had available at the time. 
And, at this stage of the lending relationship, and given these loan amounts, I dont think 
proportionate checks wouldve required MoneyBoat to ask Miss B to prove what she was 
declaring or check other information sources to verify what she had told them (or omitted to 
say) about her financial circumstances. 
So I dont think MoneyBoat did anything wrong when it made its lending decisions based on 
the information it had at the time.
Ive also taken into account what Miss B said about the way other complaints have been 
dealt with. But each complaint is looked at on its own merits  no two complaints are likely to 
be identical in every way and the outcome on each will depend on its own facts. Ive looked 
at the circumstances that apply in this particular case and what happened on other cases 
doesnt change my conclusion here.  
In order to uphold this complaint I have to be able to say a lender did something wrong. And, 
in this particular case, for the reasons Ive explained, I dont think that MoneyBoat did 
anything wrong in deciding to lend to Miss B. My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I dont uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2020.
