The complaint
Ms B complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Marbles, provided credit that she 
couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
NewDay approved a credit card application for Ms B in July 2018. The credit limit was set at 
£300 and was increased to £1,300 in February 2019. In April 2020 the limit was reduced 
Ms B says that NewDay were wrong to provide credit as it wasnt affordable for her.
NewDay disagree. They say that when they approved the credit card application they 
reviewed Ms Bs credit file and found she had six accounts defaulted 33 months earlier with 
a value of £9,800 and a public record totalling £9,300 from 42 months earlier. They also 
noted that Ms B had £200 of unsecured debt she had been servicing well. Ms B had told 
them she was earning £20,000 a year and NewDay thought there was no reason to suspect 
she couldnt afford the credit they were offering or the subsequent limit increase.
Our investigator thought that NewDay shouldnt have approved the credit card application 
and she suggested NewDay should take some action to remedy the situation. But as 
NewDay didnt respond to her view the complaint has been referred to me, an ombudsman, 
for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I think NewDay completed proportionate checks before approving the credit card. They 
reviewed Ms Bs credit file and gathered some information from her about her income and 
circumstances. But I think the information they gathered should have raised concerns about 
Ms Bs ability to repay the credit they were providing sustainably.
Thats because the credit file showed Ms B had had significant other debt (greater than her 
net income) and she hadnt been able to manage that and it was still outstanding. Whilst she 
had been able to manage the limited unsecured debt on her file I think the outstanding 
defaults and public records (County Court Judgments or bankruptcies) suggested Ms B was 
unlikely to be able to sustainably afford to repay the credit provided in the initial application. I 
think NewDay were therefore irresponsible to increase Ms Bs indebtedness.
Ive not seen evidence to suggest thered been a sustained improvement in Ms Bs financial 
situation at the time NewDay increased her limit in February 2019. Its clear Ms B had 
maintained repayments, but shed also gone over limit a few months earlier and Ive not 
seen evidence that the defaulted debt or debt pertaining to the public record had been 
repaid. So, I dont think NewDay were right to increase her indebtedness further and I think 
the additional lending was also irresponsible.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay should have approved the card, I dont think its fair for it to charge 
any interest or charges. However, Ms B has had the benefit of all the money she spent on 
the account so I think she should pay that back. NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest, fees, charges, and insurances (which have 
not already been refunded). 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Ms B along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded 
regarding this account from Ms Bs credit file. 
Or, if after the rework there is an outstanding balance to pay, NewDay should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Ms B for the remaining amount. Once    
Ms B has cleared the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded in 
relation to the account should be removed from her credit file. 
If the debt has been sold to a third party, NewDay should arrange to either buy back the debt 
from the third party or liaise with them to ensure the redress set out above is carried out 
promptly. 
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. 
It must give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. 
If it intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put things right in the way Ive set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
