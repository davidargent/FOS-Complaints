K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that Caversham Finance Limited (Trading as BrightHouse) has mishandled  
his account causing him unnecessary distress and inconvenience. 
background 
In April 2018 Mr B entered into a hire purchase  agreement for a mobile phone  with 
BrightHouse. Under the agreement  payments were  to be made  weekly. 
Unfortunately due to an unexpected bill Mr B fell behind in his payments. Mr B says he 
contacted BrightHouse and made a commitment to clear all the arrears by a set date in June  
2018. But on the date Mr B says hed arranged to make the payment BrightHouse sent an 
agent to his home. The agent spoke to his partner whod been unaware of the agreement.  
This had caused  difficulties in the relationship and Mr B had to spend time away from his 
home as a result. 
Mr B complained to BrightHouse that the sending around of their agent had been unfair and 
caused him unnecessary distress and inconvenience. BrightHouse agreed that Mr B hadnt 
received the standard  of customer service he could reasonably have expected and paid him 
£40 as compensation. 
Mr B was unhappy at BrightHouses resolution and complained  to this service.  Mr B said that 
BrightHouse had also sent an agent  round to see him In July 2018 when he had again made 
an offer to clear arrears. He said BrightHouse had told him to add that complaint to this one. 
Our investigator didnt  recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. She said when 
payments werent  made on time a creditor was entitled to take action. And it wasnt 
unreasonable for an agent to attend someones  home to discuss  missed payments.  
She said that looking at the transcript provided by BrightHouse  of the call between itself and 
Mr B the arrangement  to clear the arrears had been made for the day before the agent had 
called at Mr Bs home. It appeared  that Mr B had been mistaken as to the date hed agreed  
and, as hed broken his commitment to pay, BrightHouse had acted reasonably in sending  
its agent around to his home.  
Our investigator said that even if the agreed  date of payment had been the same day the 
agent had called she thought the £40 compensation was fair to resolve  Mr Bs complaint. 
She said it was unfortunate Mr B hadnt  told his partner about  the agreement. But it wasnt 
fair to hold BrightHouse  responsible for the outcome of Mr Bs partner becoming aware  of 
information he had chosen not to share with them.
Ref: DRN14291062Mr B disagreed with our investigators  view.  He said he had concerns that a copy of the call 
hadnt been provided. And that it was odd that BrightHouse  had upheld  his complaint after it 
had listened to it. He also said that BrightHouse had sent an agent around  to his home again 
in July which had resulted  in his second  complaint. He said BrightHouse  had said this 
service would look into that matter as well as this one.
As the parties werent able to agree the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B is adamant that the agreed date for the payment had been set for the same  day the 
agent called  at his home  in June 2018. Mr B says his intention had been to pay the amount 
later in the day and this is what  he had in fact done. However the agent had called in the 
morning shortly after he had gone  to work and spoken to his partner which  had resulted in 
difficulties between them.
I appreciate Mr B is upset  about the issues that arose in his relationship with his partner 
when they discovered  he had taken  out this agreement. But I dont think  I can reasonably 
say BrightHouse are to blame for his personal problems. Mr B had made  a choice not to tell 
his partner about the hire purchase agreement.
BrightHouse has now provided  a copy of the call that set the payment date for the arrears.  
Ive heard that at the start of the call Mr B explains that he had spoken to an adviser earlier  
and agreed to make the payment to bring  his account up to date on Friday and then gives  
the date. BrightHouses staff member  then repeats the date and Mr B confirms it. For the 
remainder of the call the date is repeated  and confirmed several times. The date given is for 
the day before the agent called.
Looking at a calendar I can see that the date that was set for payment was actually a 
Thursday and not a Friday so I think Mr B made a mistake when he gave the date. But I 
dont think I can say the error is BrightHouses fault as the dates was repeated  and 
confirmed by Mr B during  the call on more than one occasion.
So Im satisfied that the agent called at Mr Bs house the day after hed committed  to clear 
the arrears and as far as BrightHouse  was aware  Mr B had broken his agreement to pay. In 
the circumstances I cant  reasonably  say that BrightHouse acted unfairly by sending  its 
agent to Mr Bs home.
BrightHouse upheld Mr Bs complaint and said that its service had fallen below what should  
have been expected. Im not clear  why it made the decision to provide compensation to Mr B 
but that is a matter for BrightHouse.  I dont  think BrightHouse  did anything  wrong  and so 
think £40 compensation is more than adequate  to resolve Mr Bs complaint.
Ive seen that Mr B says the same  thing happened  again in July and he wanted to make  a 
second complaint.  I dont  have any evidence about  that second complaint and so I cant deal 
with it. If Mr B wishes to pursue that complaint he will need to raise it again with BrightHouse 
and request that it investigates the matter.  Should  Mr B be unhappy with the conclusion of 
that investigation he can, of course, raise  that as a separate matter with this service.
Ref: DRN14291063Looking at the evidence for this complaint and for the reasons given above  Im not upholding 
Mr Bs complaint and Im not asking  BrightHouse to do anything more.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above Im not upholding Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 November  2019.
