The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that NewDay Ltd approved him for new and further credit, all of which he 
feels were unaffordable for him at those times.
What happened
Mr B applied for a NewDay administered credit account in March 2015. His application was 
successful, and NewDay provided him with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £450. 
In July 2015, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Bs account from £450 to £650. A 
further credit limit increase, from £650 to £850, took place in November 2015.
In January 2021, Mr B raised a complaint with NewDay because he felt that none of the 
above listed provisions of credit had been affordable for him at those times, and that this 
should have been apparent to NewDay had they undertaken checks into his financial 
position before providing him with the credit.
NewDay looked at Mr Bs complaint. They confirmed that they had undertaken checks into 
Mr Bs financial position before approving him for new or further credit, and that thered been 
nothing resulting from those checks that they felt should have given them cause to suspect 
that Mr B might not be able to afford the credit hed been provided. Because of this, NewDay 
didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the initial provision of credit 
and the first credit limit increase had been reasonable, but they felt that the information that 
had been available to NewDay about Mr Bs financial position at the time of the second 
credit limit increase was such that the credit limit increase shouldnt have taken place. So, 
they recommended that this complaint be upheld in Mr Bs favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for 
that customer at that time.
NewDay feel that they did that here, and note that when Mr B applied for the credit account 
that they took information from him about his income and expenditure at that time, and also 
that NewDay reviewed Mr Bs credit file to get a better understanding of his wider financial 
position. And NewDay maintain that there was nothing resulting from that information which 
they felt should have given them cause to suspect that Mr B might not be able to afford the 
credit account with an initial credit limit of £450 that was offered to him.
When Mr B applied for the credit account in March 2015, he told NewDay that he was 
employed with a gross annual income of £30,000, and that he had total existing unsecured 
debt of £16,500. NewDay also reviewed Mr Bs credit file from which they assessed that 
there was no record of Mr B having any historical credit account defaults or adverse public 
records such as County Court Judgements. 
NewDay also noted that Mr Bs credit file appeared to demonstrate that Mr B was managing 
his existing credit commitments without incident at that time, and didnt show any record of 
Mr B using short term payday loans, which might be an indication that Mr B was struggling at 
that time.
The checks into Mr Bs financial position that NewDay undertook here seem reasonable to 
me, and Im satisfied that they were proportionate in relation to the amount of credit under 
consideration. And while Mr Bs total amount of existing debt at that time was quite large 
when considered as a percentage of his annual income, I dont feel that it was prohibitive 
such that further credit shouldnt have been offered to him if that credit was deemed to have 
been affordable for him. 
Im also satisfied that there was nothing resulting from the information that NewDay gathered 
about Mr Bs financial position at that time that suggested that he might in all likelihood not 
be able to afford the new credit account with an initial credit limit of £450 that was then 
provided to him, and as such I feel it was fair for NewDay to have approved Mr Bs initial 
credit application and provided him with the relatively low amount of new credit that they did.
In July 2015, NewDay proactively increased the credit limit on Mr Bs account from £450 to 
£650. Before doing so, NewDay reviewed how Mr B had managed his NewDay credit 
account in the months leading up to the credit limit increase. These showed that while Mr B 
had gone over the credit limit on the account in the first month of having it, hed maintained 
the account balance within the limit since that time. 
Additionally, NewDay also reviewed updated information obtained from a credit reference 
agency which continued to show that Mr B appeared to be managing his existing credit 
commitments without incident and that his total amount of existing debt hadnt significantly 
increased.
Again, these checks seem both reasonable and proportionate to me in relation to the 
relatively small amount of further credit being provided to Mr B at that time. However, its 
noticeable that theres a considerable discrepancy between the £16,500 total amount of 
existing debt that Mr B had informed NewDay he held when he applied for the credit account 
a few months earlier, and the amount of total existing debt reported by the credit reference 
agency to NewDay at that time  which was only approximately £200. And I feel that 
NewDay should have taken steps to better understand this discrepancy, given that it 
indicated that there was a strong possibility that the information they were being provided 
with by the credit reference agency might not be complete.
Had NewDay investigated this point further they would have discovered that the discrepancy 
related to a car finance agreement that Mr B had which accounted for the large majority of 
the £16,500 total debt that hed advised NewDay of in Mach 2015. Mr B was still repaying 
this car finance agreement in July 2015, and his credit file shows that it was being reported 
to his credit file by one of the credit reference agencies that supplied information to NewDay at that time - so its unclear as to why this information wasnt being reported by that credit 
reference agency to NewDay. 
However, its also the case that in July 2015, Mr B was maintaining that car finance 
agreement without incident, and so Im satisfied that it would have been reasonable for 
NewDay to have continued to offer the further £200 credit to Mr B that they did, had they 
investigated Mr Bs financial position in more detail as I feel that they should.  
Additionally, while it was the case that Mr B had been using his NewDay credit account to 
withdraw cash in the months leading up to the credit limit increase  which can be an 
indicator of potential financial difficulty  Im satisfied that there werent any other indicators 
of potential financial difficulty present in the information that NewDay assessed or should 
have assessed, and so Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to have provided the 
further £200 credit that they did to Mr B at that time.
Finally, in November 2015, NewDay proactively increased the credit limit on Mr Bs account 
by a further £200, from £650 to £850. Once again, before applying the credit limit increase,  
NewDay assessed how Mr B had managed his NewDay credit account in the months 
leading up to the credit limit increase, as well as reviewed updated information from a credit 
reference agency to refresh their understanding of Mr Bs wider financial position.
However, again, the information that NewDay were provided by the credit reference agency 
didnt include the car finance agreement that formed the large majority of Mr Bs total 
existing debt at that time, and once again I feel that it was incumbent on NewDay to have 
confirmed the status of that car finance agreement as part of any credit worthiness 
assessment that they undertook.
Had NewDay done this, they would have discovered that Mr B had been struggling to repay 
that car finance agreement and had fallen into arrears on it and had been in a repayment 
arrangement with the finance provider for the past several months. This would have been a 
clear indicator of financial difficulty. And its also noticeable that further indicators of potential 
financial difficulty were present at that time, including that Mr B had continued to use his 
NewDay credit account to withdraw cash, and that hed incurred a fee from NewDay for 
going over the agreed credit limit on his account in the month immediately before NewDay 
increased the credit limit on the account for the second time.
I therefore find it difficult to conclude that NewDay should have reasonably provided any 
further credit to Mr B in November 2015. Indeed, at the very least, I feel that the information 
that NewDay should have assessed should have given them cause to conduct more detailed 
checks into Mr Ds financial position before providing any further credit to him. And I feel that 
these further checks should in all likelihood have included a review of Mr Bs current account 
statements for the months leading up to the proposed second credit limit increase.
And had NewDay reviewed Mr Bs current account statements here, they would have seen 
that Mr B had recently had to resort to using an unarranged overdraft with his current 
account provider, and that hed also taken to using short term payday loans.
Im aware that information to that effect wasnt provided to NewDay by the credit reference 
agencies, but Mr B had told NewDay of his total amount of existing debt when he first 
applied for the credit account, and as explained, I feel it was NewDays responsibility to have 
resolved any discrepancies between the information provided by Mr B and that received 
from the credit reference agencies before offering any further credit to him.All of which means that I dont feel that the second credit limit increase, from £650 to £850, 
should have fairly or reasonably been provided by NewDay to Mr B, and it follows from this 
that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr Bs favour on that basis.  
Putting things right
NewDay must recall Mr Bs account from the third-party debt purchasing company to whom 
its my understanding the account has been sold.
NewDay must then reimburse to Mr Bs account all charges and fees incurred on the 
account following the credit limit increase to £850 in November 2015.
NewDay must also reimburse to Mr Bs account all interest accrued on the account for any 
portion of the account balance above £650 from the point of the credit limit increase in 
November 2015 onwards.
If these reimbursement result in a credit balance in Mr Bs favour, NewDay must pay this 
balance to Mr B along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of repayment.
If following the above reimbursements, a balance remains outstanding on the account for Mr 
B to pay, NewDay must contact Mr B to arrange an affordable repayment plan ensuring that 
no interest is charged on any part of the remaining balance above £650.
Finally, NewDay must arrange for the removal of all adverse credit reporting relating to this 
account following the credit limit increase to £850 in November 2015.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
