K820x#14complaint
Mr B has complained that Barclays Bank  UK PLC will not refund any commission  it received 
from his payment protection insurance (PPI) premiums for the policy he took out in 2005.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To be clear, my decision  only deals with Mr Bs complaint about commission. Thats because 
a colleague of mine  has already decided that we are unable  to consider Mr Bs complaint 
about the mis-sale  of the PPI, in a decision on 17 December 2018.
Im not upholding Mr Bs complaint about  the commission. Ill explain why below.
In 2017, following a Supreme Court judgment, the Financial  Conduct  Authority (FCA),  issued 
some rules  about how businesses should deal with complaints  about  the non-disclosure of 
commission where PPI was sold. 
The FCA said that if a business got a high level of commission and profit share  from the PPI 
policy  more than 50% of the PPI premium  and it didnt tell the consumer, then that could 
create an unfair relationship between the parties.  So to put that right, the FCA said that 
businesses should  pay back  the amount of commission and profit share  that was more than 
50% of the PPI premium.
But these  rules and the Supreme Court judgment relate to the unfair relationship  provisions 
in the Consumer Credit  Act 1974. The unfair relationship provisions  which  were  added to 
the Consumer  Credit Act in 2006  came into force on 6 April 2007. The changes  made in 
2006 explained that the unfair relationship  provisions would only apply to credit  agreements 
taken out on or after 6 April 2007, or agreements taken out before then, which were still 
running on 6 April 2008.
Barclays has sent us information that shows Mr Bs loan was taken out in March 2005 and 
ended in October 2005. So it wasnt taken  out on or after 6 April 2007 or still running on 
6 April 2008. And so based on what Ive said above,  I dont think the unfair relationship 
provisions in the Consumer Credit  Act, the Supreme Court  judgment,  or the rules and 
guidance made by the FCA in relation to the non-disclosure of commission  apply here.
So Barclays  doesnt  need to refund any of the commission Mr B paid for the PPI they had 
with their loan.
