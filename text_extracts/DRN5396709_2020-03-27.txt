K820x#14complaint
Mr Y complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie,SCA unfairly closed his account and kept his 
money.
background
Mr Y says that PayPal  closed his account  without  reason and with about Â£16,000 in it. He 
says that was unfair and based  on a misunderstanding  and would like his money returned. 
Mr Y says he gave PayPal all the information  it asked  for and says his account  should be re-
opened. And says he was told by PayPal that it thought his bank statements were  not 
legitimate.
PayPal says it acted  in line with the account  terms and conditions  by closing the account and 
so hasnt made a mistake.  It says in line with those terms and conditions  its entitled to retain 
Mr Ys money for up to 180 days in case of future  claims.
Mr Y brought his complaint to us but our investigator  didnt uphold it and didnt think PayPal 
had acted unfairly or made a mistake.  The investigator thought in line with the account terms 
and conditions PayPal  was entitled to close an account and retain money for up to 180 days.
Mr Y doesnt  accept that view and has asked for it to be reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for the same reasons.  I realise Mr Y will be disappointed  
by my decision.
I have looked  at the account terms and conditions which  Im satisfied Mr Y would have 
agreed to when the account was opened.  And Im satisfied that PayPal in line with those 
terms and conditions is entitled to close an account  and retain a customers  money  for up to 
180 days to cover any claims. So I dont  think PayPal  has acted unfairly or made a mistake 
here by deciding to close  Mr Ys account  or by keeping his money  for future  claims.
I appreciate that Mr Y says there was a misunderstanding between  himself and PayPal over 
the information required. But I dont  think that matters as for the reasons I have explained  Im 
satisfied PayPal was entitled to take the steps it did. I accept that PayPal retained Mr Ys 
money but again Im satisfied it was entitled to do so. I think it likely that PayPal has now 
returned Mr Ys money as the 180 days has now passed and I would have expected Mr Y to 
have told us if that wasnt the case.
Overall Im satisfied that PayPal hasnt made a mistake here or acted unfairly.  I accept that 
Mr Y has been a customer of PayPal  since 2017  and that PayPals decision has had an 
affect on his business. But I cant fairly order PayPal to reopen the account or do anything 
further in the circumstances of this complaint
