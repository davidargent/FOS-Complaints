The complaint
Miss L complains that Premium Credit Limited (Premium Credit) failed to take the correct 
payment towards her account balance.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know it will disappoint Miss L, but I agree with the investigators opinion. Please let me 
explain why.
Theres no dispute here that Premium Credit took the wrong amount when Miss L tried to 
pay off the balance on her account.
Theyve apologised for that and have told Miss L she can either pay the remaining Â£100 or 
theyll pay back the amount taken and she can continue as before.
I understand that Miss L would like them to compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience caused but I think in this case an apology was sufficient.
I say that because fortunately Miss L was able to identify the problem within a week or so 
and theres been no financial impact. Ive also not been presented with evidence Miss Ls 
credit file has been damaged as a result of the error. So, whilst I understand Miss Ls 
concern I think there was limited inconvenience caused and I dont think it would be fair to 
ask Premium Credit to take any further action.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 September 2022.
