The complaint
The estate of the late Mrs C complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to it the amount 
that she paid to upgrade some windows. The estate is being represented by an adviser 
appointed by an executor of the estate. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the late Mrs C entered into a purchase contract in March 2017 with a supplier for it to 
upgrade her windows  the total cost of the work was £4,389, she paid a deposit of 
£1,097.25 and she used her Lloyds Bank credit card later that month to pay the 
balance of £3,292;
the windows were upgraded but sadly Mrs C has passed away and the supplier has 
been dissolved and the estate has made a claim to Lloyds Bank under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for a refund of the money that was paid to the supplier 
 its representative says that the supplier misrepresented itself to Mrs C and that the 
contract was breached because the windows werent replaced and werent self-
cleaning, the supplier guaranteed the work for ten years but has been dissolved and 
it started the work before Mrs Cs right to cancel the contract had ended;
Lloyds Bank said that the supplier had fulfilled its contractual obligations and the 
windows werent defective but the estate of the late Mrs C then complained to this 
service;
our investigator said that there wasnt enough evidence to show that a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation was made by the supplier so she couldnt reasonably 
ask Lloyds Bank to refund any money to the estate  but the estate has asked for its 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold the estates complaint about Lloyds Bank, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Lloyds Banks response to the claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of the claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
the purchase contract described the work as Remove existing double-glazing units 
and gaskets, chemical clean frames, replace with new gaskets  and units, service 
hinges and handles, re-seal frames inside and out  Im not persuaded that the 
supplier had agreed to replace the frames or that it had agreed to provide self-
cleaning windows;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the late Mrs C wanted to cancel the contract so, 
although the work was started within 14 days of the contact being signed, Im not 
persuaded that the supplier acted incorrectly in doing so;
the windows were guaranteed by the supplier for ten years but the supplier has been 
dissolved  Ive seen no evidence to show that the windows are defective or that 
theres a valid claim under the guarantee and Lloyds Bank says that if the windows 
do become defective it will look at a claim if the defect is listed and covered by the 
guarantee;
it does look as though the supplier misrepresented its credentials but I dont consider 
it to be likely in these circumstances that the late Mrs C relied on that 
misrepresentation or that she was induced into entering into the purchase contact 
because of that misrepresentation;
I sympathise with the estate for the loss of Mrs C but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the supplier or 
that the late Mrs C was induced into entering into the purchase contract by a 
misrepresentation made by the supplier; and
I consider that Lloyds Banks response to the estates claim has been fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to refund any of the money that was paid for the windows, to pay any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of the 
late Mrs C to accept or reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
