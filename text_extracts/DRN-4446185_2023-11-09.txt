The complaint
Ms B, a sole trader, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) defaulted 
her Bounce Back Loan (BBL) and with the service she received surrounding that. 
What happened
Ms B found that she was suddenly unable to make payments to her BBL because she didnt 
have a card reader which she now needed to transfer the money to make the BBL 
payments. This ultimately led to Ms Bs BBL account first falling into arrears and then later 
being defaulted by NatWest because of those arrears. 
Ms B wasnt happy about this, especially as she couldnt make the payments to the BBL to 
prevent that account falling into arrears. And she also wasnt happy that NatWest hadnt 
provided her information about the Pay As You Grow (PAYG) payment deferral scheme as 
theyd promised to. So, she raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to Ms B and said they didnt feel theyd done anything wrong in how 
theyd administered the account. NatWest also noted that they had spoken to Ms B about 
the PAYG options available to her on 8 November 2022 and sent her a link to enable her to 
apply for a PAYG payment deferral plan that same day. Ms B wasnt satisfied with NatWests 
response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Ms B 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms B has explained that an apparent change in NatWests processes meant that she was 
unable to make payments towards her BBL online, because she lacked the card reader that 
had suddenly become necessary for her to be able to transfer money to the account from 
which the BBL payments were taken.
But there were other means of payment available to Ms B besides her preferred method of 
online transfer. For instance, Ms B could have telephoned NatWest to verbally instruct the 
transfer of the payment money into the relevant account. And Ms B did make a payment 
towards the arrears that had accrued on the BBL by this method in November 2022.
Accordingly, I dont accept Ms Bs position that she was unable to make a payment towards 
her BBL. This is because Im satisfied that alternative payment options remained available to 
Ms B which she didnt utilise. And because of this, I feel that Ms B should fairly be deemed 
responsible for not making the BBL payments  because she didnt make them by the 
channels that remained available to her  rather than it being the case that NatWest should 
be deemed to be at fault for the payments not being made, as Ms B contends.
Because Ms B didnt meet her contractual payment obligations on the BBL, and because 
she didnt clear the arrears that had accrued on the BBL, I feel that it was fair and 
reasonable that NatWest would begin the collections and recoveries process that they did, 
and which ultimately led to the defaulting of the BBL account for non-payment.
Furthermore, NatWest have been able to demonstrate to my satisfaction that they sent 
numerous items of correspondence to Ms B about the arrears on the BBL and attempted to 
contact her by telephone on several occasions. As such, I feel that NatWest did fairly 
attempt to inform Ms B about the arrears on the BBL and about the potential consequences 
for Ms B of not clearing those arrears.
Ms B feels that NatWest didnt inform her of the PAYG options that may have been available 
to her. But NatWests call notes include a discussion of the PAYG options with Ms B on 8 
November 2022, at which time NatWest have also demonstrated that an email link to their 
PAYG website page was sent to Ms B. 
Ms B says that she never received the PAYG link from NatWest. But if that were the case, 
given that Im satisfied that the PAYG options were discussed with Ms B on the telephone, I 
feel it was for Ms B to have chased NatWest about this or to have located the PAYG page 
on NatWests website herself.
It also must be noted any PAYG payment deferral plan would have only affected Ms Bs 
obligations to make the future BBL payments covered by the plan. And any PAYG plan 
wouldnt have affected the arrears that were already present on the BBL account at the time 
the plan was set up. This means that its likely that Ms B would still have been required by 
NatWest to have cleared the arrears that were already present on her account unless she 
engaged with NatWest about those arrears and made an alternative arrangement.
But Ms B didnt clear the arrears that were already present on the BBL in November 2022, 
and she didnt engage in a meaningful discussion with NatWest about those arrears. And so, 
even if Ms B had successfully applied to NatWest for a PAYG payment deferral plan, Im not 
convinced that the outcome that took place here  the defaulting of the BBL  would have 
been avoided. This is because I feel that to avoid the likely defaulting of the BBL, Ms B 
would have needed to take action in regard to the BBL arrears which I dont feel that shes 
reasonably demonstrated that she was likely to have taken.
Ms B is also unhappy that NatWest transferred her defaulted BBL debt to a debt recovery 
agency (DRA). But the transferal of debt to a DRA is a common practice and one which is 
addressed and permitted by the terms of the BBL agreement  specifically,
section 12  which Ms B agreed and consented to when she took the BBL. And NatWest
didnt require any further authorisation from Ms B beyond this to take the steps they did.
Finally, Ms B is unhappy with how NatWest handled her complaint about her BBL. 
Specifically, Ms B is unhappy that NatWest didnt instruct the DRA to which her debt was 
transferred to not contact her about the debt after shed raised her complaint with NatWest.
The rules by which this service must abide, which can be found in the Dispute Resolution 
(DISP) section of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook include that this 
service isnt permitted to consider a complaint about how a business has handled a 
complaint. As such, given that this aspect of Ms Bs complaint is about NatWests actions in 
response to her raising a complaint with them, Im satisfied that this aspect of Ms Bs 
complaint isnt within my remit to consider.
All of which means that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take 
any further or alternative action here. This is because, ultimately, Ms B didnt make the BBL payments she was contractually obliged to make, and because Im satisfied that Ms B 
remained able to make those payments via channels other than by online transfer. 
I realise this wont be the outcome Ms B was wanting, but I hope that shell understand, 
given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2023.
