K821x#15Complaint
Mrs W complains that Active Securities Limited (trading as 247 Moneybox) irresponsibly lent 
to her. 
Background
Mrs W was given 20 payday  loans  by 247 Moneybox between November 2013 and 
November 2016.  Some information about Mrs Ws loans is attached as an appendix at the 
end of this decision.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mrs Ws complaint and thought it wasnt fair for 
247 Moneybox to provide any of the loans to her. So our adjudicator  upheld  the complaint in 
full. 
247 Moneybox didnt initially agree with the adjudicators findings  and raised  further points. 
Our adjudicator addressed 247 Moneyboxs  further points, but 247 Moneybox didnt respond 
further. As the complaint  wasnt  resolved  it was passed to me. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  short  term lending on our website. And Ive used this general  approach  to 
help me decide  Mrs Ws complaint. 
247 Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247 Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that 247Moneybox was required  to 
establish whether  Mrs W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Ref: DRN81156562Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The previous regulators (the OFT) Irresponsible
Lending Guidance  (ILG) defined sustainability in similar terms and applies to Mrs Ws earlier  
loans. And it follows that a lender  should  realise,  or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  
that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
The adjudicator gave a detailed explanation about  why 247 Moneybox shouldnt have lent 
Mrs W any of the loans  and having considered all the available information, I agree with the 
adjudicator and Im upholding  Mrs Ws complaint for broadly the same reasons.
247 Moneybox says it asked Mrs W about her monthly income and expenses  and I can see 
that Mrs Ws income was recorded  as £850 throughout the borrowing and her expenses 
ranged from £230 to £606.
247 Moneybox also says it searched Mrs Ws credit file, it has provided the results of the 
search and from what I can see, Mrs W had multiple adverse entries on her file that 
shouldve concerned 247 Moneybox about  her ability to sustainably afford any loans. For 
example, I can see that she had three  defaulted  accounts, was in debt management  plans 
with other  creditors and also in arrears  with other  creditors. These were all active adverse 
entries and I think as a responsible lender 247 Moneybox should have reacted to this 
information, as it suggests  Mrs W was struggling  to manage her money  and wasnt in a 
position to sustainably repay  her loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247 Moneyboxs lending history with Mrs W, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which 247 Moneybox should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because by this point, Mrs W had been borrowing from 247 Moneybox  for 
seven months without any breaks  and her loan amounts were increasing. I think  there was 
an indication  that Ms W wasnt using these loans for their intended purpose of short term 
cash flow problems.
And from loan 6 onwards Mrs W was provided with a new loan within a short time of settling 
a previous one. So 247 Moneybox ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs W 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Mrs Ws indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Ive also considered the points about  the gaps 247 MoneyBox has raised  and like the 
adjudicator, I dont find that any of the gaps  between loans was sufficient to allow 247 
Moneybox reasonably  conclude  that Mrs Ws finances had improved especially as shed 
been borrowing  for an extended period of time.
I think Mrs W was reliant on these  loans and used them  as a supplement for her normal  
income. And in the circumstances, Mrs W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she 
Ref: DRN81156563owed 247 Moneybox. Loan 20 was taken out about  36 months  after Mrs Ws first and it was 
for a larger amount. Mrs W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
247 Moneybox over an extended  period.
As 247Moneybox  continued to provide loans to Mrs W, Mrs W lost out because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mrs Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  Mrs Ws complaint in full as there was sufficient adverse information  
about Mrs Ws ability to afford the loans  and by loan 6, Mrs W had established an 
unsustainable pattern of borrowing and 247 Moneybox shouldnt have continued lending to 
her. 247 Moneybox needs to put things right.  
What 247 Moneybox  should do to put things  right
To put things right for Mrs W, 247 Moneybox  should:
refund all the interest and charges paid as a result of loans 1 to 20; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement ;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Ws credit file as a result  of these 
loans;
the number of loans  taken from loan six means any information  recorded about them is 
adverse - so all entries  about loans 6 to 20 should be removed from Mrs Ws credit  file
HM Revenue & Customs requires 247 Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247 Moneybox must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mrs Ws complaint. Active Securities  Limited 
should pay Mrs W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs W to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 August 2019.
