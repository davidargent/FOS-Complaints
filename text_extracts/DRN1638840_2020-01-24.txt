K821x#15complaint
Miss M says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 28 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss M between  June 2016 to 
June 2018. Miss Ms borrowing history  is summarised at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ms complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as Miss M had loans from other short-term lenders as 
well as Sunny. They  also thought the pattern of borrowing indicated Miss M was reliant on 
short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but offered as a gesture of goodwill to write  off the 
outstanding amount Miss M had on loan 28. Miss M declined Sunnys offer so, the complaint 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Ref: DRN16388402Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 4. Miss M 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I won be making  further  findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Miss M and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Miss Ms fifth loan in just over five months, 
I think Sunny  should have  been looking to build a clearer picture about Miss Ms finances 
before lending her this loan. 
Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that Miss M was borrowing from other short-term lenders as well as having out-standing 
loans with Sunny itself.  The repayments  for these loans would have been  increasing his 
monthly outgoings. 
Additionally, I think the fact Miss M repaid her loans much earlier than planned should have 
caused some concern  to Sunny. As that might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate  
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a 
regular basis. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss M was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss M had taken  out seven loans within six months.  So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss M was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £300 and loan 7 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Miss M was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but to meet an ongoing need.  Especially when it was followed four days 
later by loan 8 which was for £50.
Ref: DRN16388403From  loan 7 onwards  Miss M was provided  with a new loan within  days of taking out 
the previous one. 
Miss M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  28 was 
taken out two years after Miss Ms first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ms ability  to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
The outstanding balance  due on Miss Ms loan has been transferred to a third party. Sunny  
should buy the loan back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loan back than it needs to work  
with the third party to make sure the following  is achieved: 
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 6 to 28;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework any outstanding loans  applying all payments  made by Miss M as if they went  
towards the principal  amount borrowed.  But importantly, Sunny needs to make sure 
that it collects no more than the principal sum lent. 
If and when the amount Miss M has paid exceeds the amount she was lent, any 
further amounts  paid should be treated as overpayments. Any overpayments that 
may have been made should  be refunded to Miss M with 8% simple interest from the 
date the overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
if there is still an outstanding balance, any refunds  should  be used to repay any 
balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If there  is any surplus this should be 
repaid to Miss M.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Miss Ms credit file in relation to loans 
5 and 6. 
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 to 28 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file. You do not have  to remove any outstanding loans from Miss Ms 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
Ref: DRN16388404 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing the above Miss M still has an outstanding balance due on loan 6 then it should 
try and work  together  to come to a mutually  agreeable  repayment  plan in order to repay 
what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Miss M fairly. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 February  2020.
