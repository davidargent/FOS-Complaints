The complaint
Miss G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA closed her account. Shed like it 
reopened and compensation for the impact on her. 
What happened
Miss G had an account with PayPal. 
On 16 January 2021 PayPal terminated Miss Gs access to her account without any notice. 
At the time Miss G didnt have any funds in the account. 
Miss G complained to PayPal. She advised that she used her account to sell items via online 
selling platforms. 
PayPal reviewed Miss Gs complaint, but they didnt uphold it. So Miss G brought her 
complaint to our service. She explained that PayPals decision to close her account was 
causing her significant stress and upset. 
One of our investigators looked into Miss Gs complaint, but didnt uphold it. She asked 
Miss G for more details or evidence of the sales shed made through the online selling 
platforms  but Miss G didnt respond. Overall, she thought PayPal followed Miss Gs user 
agreement when terminating her account. And they didnt need to do anything further. 
Miss G didnt agree, so its been passed to me to decide.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the terms of Miss Gs PayPal user agreement, and considered whether they 
acted fairly in closing Miss Gs account. PayPals user agreement states they can close any 
account by giving 2 months notice. But to close an account with immediate effect PayPal 
need to meet a set of conditions, set out in the user agreement. These conditions include 
breach of the user agreement. 
I realise this will be disappointing to Miss G, but PayPal arent under any obligation to share 
their reasons in choosing to close her account. But its my role to consider if theyve acted 
fairly in doing so. 
Ive reviewed the evidence presented by PayPal  and considered that, despite being asked, 
Miss Gs hasnt provided any evidence showing the sales she made using her PayPal 
account to the online selling platforms. Having considered this Im satisfied that PayPal 
acted in line with the user agreement when they decided to close her account with 
immediate effect. 
I understand this will disappoint Miss G but for the reasons Ive outlined above I wont be 
asking PayPal to do anything further here.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
