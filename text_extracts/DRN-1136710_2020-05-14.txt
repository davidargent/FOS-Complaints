Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been given and that the information recorded about the loans from 
loan six was adverse so should be removed from Mr Ls credit. 
Sunny disagreed initially offered to uphold the complaint from loan 28 onwards. Mr L 
rejected the offer. Sunny later amended its offer to uphold from loan 27 but again, Mr L didnt 
accept it. Sunny has also written off the outstanding balance on the account.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr L didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr L had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a more proportionate check for loan five, reflective of the 
behaviour of Mr Ls borrowing, would likely have shown that Mr L was have problems 
managing his finances. I say this because Mr L had established a pattern of borrowing more than one loan 
concurrently  up to three loans at one time when loan three was taken. This, along with the 
fact that Mr L was repaying his loans well before the agreed term of the loans, only to 
reborrow more credit the same day, could have been and indication that Mr L was juggling 
his finances. His behaviour was that he was repaying one short-term high cost loan only to 
replace it with another. 
I think this should have caused Sunny to have looked to build a bigger picture of Mr Ls 
financial circumstances. And if it had done so, it would have seen that Mr L was also 
borrowing from at least one other short-term credit provider as well as the lending he already 
had with Sunny. So, I think it most likely Mr L was in financial difficulty and it wasnt fair of 
Sunny to have lent to him any further. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr L had taken out six loans within three months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ls 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ls first loan was for £100 and loan six was for £100.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr L was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Further to what I have said about re-borrowing shortly after an earlier loan was 
repaid, this continued from loan six where Mr L was provided with a new loan within 
days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 33 was 
taken out 19 months after Mr Ls first. And it was for a larger amount  £350 
compared to the first loan of £100. Mr L had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 33 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Putting things right
Taking account of any outstanding balance Sunny has written off it should:refund all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans five to 33;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan five from Mr Ls credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 33 should be removed from 
Mr Ls credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ls complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
 
 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2020.
