DRN-4172071
The complaint
Miss S complains about a motor hire agreement she had with Motability Operations Limited 
and is unhappy she was misled about a £250 early termination fee.
What happened
Miss S was incorrectly informed about a £250 cancellation fee that she believed would be 
refunded immediately if she was to take delivery of a new vehicle after her contract ended. 
Motability accepts that Miss S was incorrectly informed and agreed to pay Miss S the £250, 
plus an additional £50 as compensation. 
Miss S referred her complaint to our service where an investigator explained why he felt 
what Motability had done was fair and why it was not required to do anything more. Miss S 
remained unhappy and asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Motability accepts that Miss S was not correctly informed during the telephone conversation 
and has refunded the £250 payment to Miss S. It has also offered to pay an additional £50 
for any distress and inconvenience caused. I have considered Miss Ss detailed submissions 
but like the investigator, I am not persuaded Motability needs to do more in this case. It has 
accepted the error and already paid the £250. I accept this may have been inconvenient for 
Miss S, but Im satisfied in the circumstances here the £50 is sufficient compensation for 
this, along with any interest Miss S believes she is due for the delayed payment.
My final decision
I do not uphold Miss Ss complaint and simply leave it to Miss S to decide if on reflection she 
would now wish to accept the £50 Motability offered. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
