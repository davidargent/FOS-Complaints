The complaint
Miss C is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, put a permanent limitation on her 
account.
What happened
In February 2021, PayPal put a permanent limitation on Miss Cs account. Miss C wasnt 
happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Cs complaint, but they noted that theyd permanently limited Miss Cs 
account because the usage of the account had been in breach of their Acceptable Use 
policy, so they didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint.
Miss C wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that PayPal hadnt acted 
unfairly by permanently limiting Miss Cs account, and so they also didnt uphold Miss Cs 
complaint.
Miss C remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been frustrating for Miss C to have been told that the 
usage on her account contravened PayPals Acceptable Use policy and that it was for that 
reasons that her account had been permanently limited by PayPal, but to not be told 
specifically which aspect of that policy her account activity was supposed to have 
contravened.
PayPal have confirmed to this service that the reason they permanently limited Miss Cs 
account was because Miss C had used the account for the sale of lottery or raffle tickets, 
which are activities that are prohibited in PayPals Acceptable Use policy, as quoted below:
Activities involving gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee 
and a prize, including, but not limited to casino games, sports betting, horse or 
greyhound racing, fantasy sports, lottery tickets, other ventures that facilitate 
gambling, games of skill (whether or not legally defined as gambling) and 
sweepstakes, if the operator and customers are located exclusively in 
jurisdictions where such activities are permitted by law.
Its up to a business to decide whether it will provide, or continue to provide, its services to a 
customer. What this service would expect would be that if a business decided to stop 
providing a level of service to a customer, as PayPal have in this instance, that the business 
would base that decision on a reasonable premise and that this would be communicated to 
that customer where appropriate. 
In this instance, PayPal reviewed Miss Cs account and determined that Miss Cs usage of 
that account included the sale of lottery or raffle tickets, and PayPal have provided evidence 
to this service which appears to confirm their assessment. As such, given that such account 
usage does contravene PayPals Acceptable Use policy, Id find it very difficult to conclude 
that PayPal have acted unfairly or unreasonably toward Miss C by placing the permanent 
limitation on her account that they did.
And, while it may have been the case that PayPals communication to Miss C regarding this 
matter could have been clearer, there can be instances where it isnt commercially prudent 
to provide information to the degree of detail that a customer might want, and so I dont feel 
that PayPals level of communication here is something that would warrant any form of 
censure or compensation in this instance.
I realise that this might not be the outcome that Miss C wanted here, but it follows from this 
that I wont be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any further action at this 
time. I hope that Miss C can understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final 
decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
