K822xcomplaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his bank  account  
and referred the outstanding balance to a debt collection  agency.
background 
Mr S had an account with NatWest. In December 2016, the account  went  into an unarranged 
overdraft and NatWest  referred it to their Collections department.  NatWest  say they tried to 
contact Mr S by phone,  text and letter. But they didnt  hear from him and his account 
remained overdrawn. In January 2017 they say they sent him a default notice, followed by a 
formal demand in February  2017. They say they didnt hear from Mr S, so his account was 
referred to their Recoveries department. At that stage, the account  became non-operational,  
meaning it couldnt be used by Mr S. NatWest then instructed  a debt collection agency 
(which Ill call M) to collect payment of the debt.
Mr S says he was admitted to hospital in November 2016 and wasnt  discharged  until March 
2017. He called NatWests Recoveries department in June 2018 and they told him to speak 
to M if he wanted to make  a complaint. 
After that, Mr S complained to NatWest  about  the situation. They upheld his complaint in part 
because they said it had been wrong  to tell him to complain to M. The complaint needed to 
be dealt with by NatWest themselves. They say they sent him vouchers to the value of £20 
as compensation  for this. But they didnt uphold the rest of Mr Ss complaint. They  said they 
had followed  their processes correctly  in making the account non-operational and 
transferring it to M.
Mr S wasnt  happy with NatWests response  so he brought his complaint to this service. 
During the course of our investigation, NatWest offered to pay a further £30 to Mr S, bringing 
the total compensation to £50. As Mr S said he hadnt received the voucher, NatWest 
offered to send him a cheque  for the full £50 instead. Our adjudicator thought that was a fair 
outcome, but Mr S didnt agree. He remains unhappy about  his account being made non-
operational and being  transferred  to M. So the complaint has been  passed to an 
ombudsman for review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When he opened his account, Mr S agreed  to be bound by NatWests terms and conditions.  
These say that, where NatWest receive  an instruction which would result in the account 
becoming overdrawn, they will treat it as a request for an unarranged overdraft. They will 
decide whether  or not to accept the request,  taking  Mr Ss financial circumstances into 
account. In December 2016, a payment was requested from Mr Ss account. He didnt have 
an arranged overdraft, and didnt have enough  money in his account to cover  the payment. 
So, under the terms and conditions, this was a request for an unarranged overdraft. Im 
satisfied that it was up to NatWest to decide whether or not to accept the request. They  
allowed the payment  to go through, creating  an unarranged overdraft.
The terms and conditions  say that unarranged overdrafts are repayable on demand.  So 
NatWest were entitled to ask Mr S to repay the money in full.
Ref: DRN01331252And the terms allow NatWest to suspend,  restrict or stop access to Mr Ss account if they 
reasonably believe  that he may have difficulty in meeting his commitments  or if hes broken 
any term of the agreement in a serious  way. So Im satisfied that they were entitled to make 
his account non-operational when  he didnt repay  the overdraft.
The terms and conditions  also allow NatWest to transfer their rights under the agreement to 
another organisation. So Im satisfied  that they were entitled  to transfer the account to M.
Mr S has provided evidence that he was in hospital from November 2016 to March 2017. Ive 
also seen his bank  statements  for this period, which show  transactions on his account 
throughout November  and December  2016. NatWests records confirm that Mr S called them  
about the overdraft in January 2017.  So Im satisfied that, even  though he was in hospital,  he 
was aware of the status of his account and was able to communicate  with NatWest.
NatWest have said that they will reconsider the situation if Mr S can provide evidence  that he 
could have paid off the overdraft if he wasnt in hospital. They asked, for example, if Mr S 
could show he had funds  in another bank which he hadnt been able to transfer to NatWest  
because he was in hospital. Our adjudicator explained  this to Mr S. But he hasnt provided 
any more information  for me to consider. So I havent seen anything which shows that he 
could have paid off the overdraft if he hadnt  been  in hospital. So I dont think  the fact that he 
was in hospital has made a material difference to whats  happened  here.  I think its likely the 
account would have gone overdrawn  anyway. And I havent seen anything to suggest that 
Mr S could have repaid  the overdraft when  NatWest asked. So I think that NatWest  would  
have made  the account non-operational  and referred it to M anyway. 
NatWest accept that they made a mistake  by telling Mr S to direct his complaint to M. 
Theyve offered  £50 as compensation for that, which I think  is fair. But, whilst I sympathise 
with Mr Ss situation, I dont think NatWest  have done anything  wrong  by making the account  
non-operational and appointing  M. So Im not going to ask them  to do any more here.
my final decision
For the reasons  above, I uphold this complaint in part. If it hasnt already done so, National 
Westminster Bank Plc should now pay the sum of £50 to Mr S.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 July 2019.
