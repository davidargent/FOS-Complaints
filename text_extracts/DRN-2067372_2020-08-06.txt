The complaint
Ms G complains about how NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua responded to her request for help
with her credit card account during extremely difficult personal circumstances.
What happened
Ms G told us about tragic circumstances she experienced, which I wont record here. Those
led to a considerable amount of time off work, then she became unemployed. She said she
told NewDay about this, but it kept charging her excessive interest, knowing she couldnt
pay. She said the debt had now been sold to a debt recovery company.
NewDay said it had offered some support when Ms G first spoke to it on 18 July 2018. It
thought it shouldve done more then, and that it had also missed an opportunity to offer
assistance when it spoke to her again on 18 October 2018. Its customer care team hadnt
got in touch.
NewDay said if it had followed the correct process, it thought that it wouldve put a hold on
Ms Gs account which wouldve prevented any interest or charges being applied. It didnt
offer that help. It offered some lesser support, and made mistakes that meant that wasnt
implemented. The debt was defaulted, then sold to a debt recovery company on 31 May
2019.
NewDay said it hadnt recognised all the mistakes it made when Ms G complained. It now
wanted to refund all the interest and charges on Ms Gs account, up to when it was passed
to the debt recovery company. That was £108 in fees and £418.07 in interest. That would
reduce her overall debt. NewDay didnt think it had made a mistake by selling the debt, as
Ms G was no longer vulnerable by then, she was just in financial difficulties. So it wouldnt
buy the debt back.
NewDay said it would pay £526.07 off her debt, and she could either have the compensation
paid to her, or use it to reduce her debt.
Our investigator thought part of this complaint should be upheld. Ms G had asked us to look
at the interest and fees charged on her account from the start, and our investigator said this
had been charged in line with the terms of the account. So she didnt think NewDay had to
pay everything back. And she didnt think it was unreasonable for NewDay to sell this debt.
But she said that in this case, NewDay shouldve done more to support Ms G. She initially
thought that its offer was a fair way of resolving this. Then she spoke to Ms G again, and got
more details of the effect this had on her at the time, and now. Our investigator asked
NewDay to arrange for Ms Gs debt to be put on hold for a short time with the debt recovery
company. And our investigator said that she now thought that NewDay should pay Ms G
£300 in compensation.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that it would pay £150, but our investigator still thought £300
was appropriate. So NewDay asked for this complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. The
case then came to me.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
NewDay has accepted that it made a number of mistakes in this case, which led to 
Ms G not being properly supported. It says it would like to refund the fees and 
interest applied after 18 July, until the debt was sold to a debt recovery company on 
31 May 2019. This will reduce Ms Gs overall debt. I agree that this refund is an 
appropriate step for NewDay to take in this case, and Ill include that in my award.
NewDay has also offered £150 in compensation. Ive not set out in detail the  
circumstances which first led Ms G into financial difficulties, or the mental and 
physical health concerns she still has now, but I think these were, and continue to be, 
serious. And I think that NewDays failure to support Ms G has made her already 
difficult circumstances considerably worse. I dont think that a payment of £150 
adequately reflects the effect that NewDays failure to support Ms G had on her. I 
think that £450 is a more appropriate sum to reflect that. NewDay can count the £150 
that it offered towards this, if it has already paid it.
Finally, NewDay has stressed that it didnt know about any existing vulnerabilities 
when it decided to sell Ms Gs debt. I think that it didnt know about these because it 
had previously failed to appropriately support Ms G. Ms G told us that shes found it 
difficult to cope with the level of contact shes had from the debt recovery company, 
and NewDay arranged a short break in that for her. I think if NewDay had been 
aware of the extent of Ms Gs continuing physical and mental health concerns, it 
would not have sold her debt to a third party. For that reason, I think that NewDay 
should now buy back this debt, and not sell it or ask any agent to manage it in future.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Ms G said she continued to be unwell. She said she accepted this decision, and appreciated  
it. NewDay replied to agree in part.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay said it would pay the refund, and compensation Id suggested. But it said there was 
no benefit to having the account returned to the administration of NewDay from the debt 
recovery company. The same payments could be made to Ms G and to her debt, and the 
account would have defaulted whether it had sold or not. 
I appreciate that the account would still have defaulted, and that returning this debt to 
NewDays administration wont make a difference to the payment and credit she receives. 
But NewDay has told us it understood Ms G wasnt vulnerable when this debt was sold. I 
think she was, and remains so. And, as I said in my provisional decision, Ms G told us shes 
found it difficult to cope with the level of contact shes had from the debt recovery company. 
NewDay arranged a short break in contact for Ms G, but said that it wasnt able to control the 
actions of this company in future. I still dont think NewDay wouldve sold this debt if it had an up to date view of Ms Gs 
circumstances. And asking NewDay to bring this debt back in-house allows it to ensure the 
debt will be managed appropriately in future.
Ive reconsidered this complaint, but Ive not changed my mind. Ill now make the award I 
originally proposed. 
My final decision
My provisional decision is that I intend to tell NewDay to refund £526.07 of Ms Gs current
debt, to pay Ms G a total of £450 in compensation, and to buy back her debt and manage
this in house in future.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 September 2020.
