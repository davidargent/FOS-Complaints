The complaint
Miss C is unhappy that she received conflicting information from National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest) surrounding her eligibility for financial assistance when her income and 
ability to pay had been impacted by Covid-19. Miss C is also unhappy that NatWest later 
defaulted her account for non-payment.
What happened
Miss C had a loan account on which she was struggling to meet the monthly repayments 
and was in an agreed arrears repayment plan with NatWest. 
In April 2020, Miss C contacted NatWest and explained that she was unable to work 
because of the impact of Covid-19. Miss C requested a three-month payment holiday 
because of this, but it was explained to her that she wasnt eligible for such a payment 
holiday because of the arrears already present on her account. Instead, NatWest placed a 
30-day hold on the account and asked Miss C to call back to update them on her position at 
the end of that period.
Miss C then received some confusing letters from NatWest and when she spoke with 
NatWest about these, she received conflicting information from NatWests staff. Miss C 
wasnt happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Miss Cs complaint. They confirmed that Miss C hadnt been eligible to 
receive the three-month payment holiday that shed applied for but acknowledged that    
Miss C had been given conflicting information. NatWest apologised for this and made a 
payment of £30 to Miss C to compensate her for any trouble and upset she may have 
incurred. NatWest also explained to Miss C that her account remained in a state of arrears 
and asked Miss C to complete an income and expenditure form and then to telephone 
NatWest to discuss potential options moving forwards.
Miss C completed the income and expenditure assessment but didnt then telephone 
NatWest as shed been asked to, as Miss C believed that NatWest would be contacting her. 
Because NatWest didnt receive any contact from Miss C, and because no payments were 
being made to the account, NatWest continued their collections activities on the account, 
which ultimately resulted in all of Miss Cs NatWest accounts being defaulted. Miss C wasnt 
happy about this, and so raised another complaint with complaint with NatWest.
NatWest looked at Miss Cs complaint, but they felt that theyd followed their collections 
procedures fairly and that defaulting of Miss Cs accounts had been reasonable. So, they 
didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint.
Miss C wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that NatWest 
hadnt acted unfairly by defaulting Miss Cs accounts when they did. And, while our 
investigator agreed that Miss C had been given confusing information by NatWest, they felt 
that the response that NatWest had already issued, including the apology and the payment 
of £30 compensation, already represented a fair and reasonable resolution to this aspect of 
Miss Cs complaint. 
Miss C wasnt satisfied with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so 
the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In April 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published temporary guidance 
regarding the provision of three-month payment holidays to eligible consumers who were 
experiencing difficulty meeting the payments due on their credit accounts because of 
financial difficulties brought about by the impact of Covid-19. The FCA guidance included 
that, for these three-month payment holidays only, the reporting of these payment holidays 
to the credit reference agencies would be suspended, so that an eligible consumer who 
benefited from such a payment holiday didnt have their credit file impacted by doing so.
Not all consumers were eligible to receive these three-month payment plans, and the FCA 
explained that the purpose of the guidance was to protect consumers who had been able to 
meet the repayments on their credit accounts without incident until that time, but who were at 
risk of incurring adverse reporting for missed or late payments on their credit files solely as a 
result of the impact of Covid-19.
The FCA also explained that consumers who didnt meet the eligibility criteria for these 
three-month payment holidays  such as those who were already in arrears on their account, 
and who had therefore already incurred adverse reporting on their credit files  should still 
be offered financial assistance by credit providers if they requested it, but that this 
assistance should be tailored to the individual circumstances of those consumers and 
shouldnt benefit from the suspension of credit file reporting that the prescribed three-month 
payment holidays benefited from.
In this instance, Miss Cs account had a history of being in arrears, and Miss C was in an 
arrears repayment plan from February 2020 at the time that she made the request for the 
three-month payment holiday in April 2020. As such, Im satisfied that because of the 
existing arrears on her account, that Miss C wasnt an eligible consumer to receive the FCA 
prescribed three-month payment holiday at the time she applied for it, and I note that she 
was advised as such by NatWest when she first made her application.
But as explained above, NatWest were still obliged to provide some form of reasonable 
assistance to Miss C here, which NatWest did by placing a 30-day hold on Miss Cs account. 
Unfortunately, because the only way NatWest could achieve this 30-day hold was to use a 
process designed to allow customers time to obtain third-party financial advice, this resulted 
in letters being automatically sent to Miss C which referenced that she would seek such 
third-party financial advice. This was understandably confusing for Miss C, and this 
confusion was compounded when later NatWest agents that Miss C spoke with verbally 
referenced the same process.
NatWest acknowledged and apologised for this confusion in their response to Miss Cs 
complaint about this matter dated 23 July 2020. And NatWest also made a payment of £30 
to Ms C to compensate her for any distress or inconvenience that may have been caused.
NatWests response here seems reasonable to me, and I dont feel that any further action is 
merited from NatWest in this regard.Additionally, its notable that the NatWest complaints agent that Miss C spoke with at the 
time of that complaint explained to Miss C that her account remained in a position of arrears 
and asked Miss C to contact the collections team as a matter of urgency to discuss her 
options. Its also notable that the complaint response letter that the agent then sent to Miss C 
repeats this request, and includes the telephone number for Miss C to call.
Furthermore, Ive also listened to a slightly earlier call between Miss C and another NatWest 
agent. On this earlier call its also confirmed to Miss C that her account remains in arrears, 
and the agent explains to Miss C that hes sent her a link to complete an income and 
expenditure assessment and that following that assessment, Miss C should telephone 
NatWest to discuss potential options. And the point that Miss C herself must telephone 
NatWest is reiterated by NatWests agent before the end of the call.
But while Miss C did complete the income and expenditure assessment, she didnt 
subsequently telephone NatWest and speak with the collections department as shed been 
asked to. And because of this, given that Miss C wasnt making any payments towards her 
account at that time, NatWest continued with their arrears collections procedure. This 
included a default notice, sent to Miss Cs address, advising that her account would be 
defaulted within 60-days if she didnt make a payment to clear the arrears or come to a 
suitable arrangement with NatWest. And because Miss C didnt clear the arrears or come to 
a suitable arrangement with NatWest, her account was defaulted, which in turn led to 
NatWest defaulting Miss Cs other accounts held with them, as per their process.
This doesnt seem unfair or unreasonable to me, and I say this because Im satisfied that 
NatWest did give Miss C ample notice of their intention to default the account, and also 
because they asked Miss C on several occasions to telephone their collections department 
and come to an arrangement with them. And because Miss C didnt come to an arrangement 
with NatWest, or make the necessary payments to her account, I dont feel that I can 
reasonably conclude that NatWest acted unfairly here.
It follows from the above that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to 
take any further action at this time. I realise that this wont be the outcome Miss C was 
wanting, but I hope she will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final 
decision that I have.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2022.
