K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs M have  complained about  the time taken  by Cofunds Limited in 2018 to transfer 
the value of a stocks  and shares  ISA they each held to another ISA manager.
background 
In response, Cofunds concluded that Mr and Mrs Ms ISAs could have been sold on 28 
August 2018 for £87,542.55 and £74,678.95 respectively. When they were sold on 21 
September 2018, they were valued at £86,115.98 and £73,108.25.
So, Cofunds  calculated  that Mr M and Mrs Ms respective ISAs had been undervalued by 
£1,426.57 and £1,570.70  and these amounts should  be paid to their new ISA manager.  
It also paid Mr and Mrs M interest at the rate of one per cent above Bank of England base 
rate for lost growth  on the full amounts of £87,542.55 and £74,678.95 that could  have been  
transferred 24 days earlier and on £1,426.57 and £1,570.70 from 21 September  2018 to the 
date of its final response letter. Interest would be subject to deduction of income tax at the 
basic rate of 20 per cent. Accordingly,  it paid net interest of £118.82 to Mr M and £171.98 to 
Mrs M.
In addition, Cofunds paid Mr M £175  for the trouble and upset  to which  he had been put in 
this matter and Mrs M £300  as Cofunds had failed  to acknowledge her complaint at all.
Both Mr and Mrs M rejected  these offers, essentially because  they didnt agree with Cofunds 
that 28 August  2018 was the earliest  date on which the transferred ISA funds could have 
been valued. In the circumstances, they thought  a valuation/transfer date of 
9 August 2018  was more appropriate.   
I issued a provisional decision in October  2018 in which I thought  that, according to the 
recorded timeline of events, Cofunds  fairly calculated the capital loss suffered by Mr and Mrs 
M due to the delay  in valuing their ISA prior to the proceeds being  transferred to a new ISA 
manager. 
But I didnt agree with the basis for compensating them for the lost growth the additional  ISA 
values would have  achieved for the delay of 24 days in executing the transfers.
Mr and Mrs M received transfer values  for ISAs  of £86,115.98 and £73,108.25  at 
21 September 2018. They ought reasonably to have received transfer values of £87,542.55  
and £74,678.95 at 28 August 2018.
So, for 24 days, they didnt receive  £87,542.55 and £74,678.95 and, since 21 September  
2018, they received transfer values  that were short by £1,426.57 and £1,570.70 respectively.
Given Mr and Mrs Ms intention was to invest the ISA proceeds with another  manager,  albeit  
in un-invested cash within a stocks and shares  ISA, they havent  been deprived of this 
capital to spend since 28 August 2018. They have been deprived of investment growth on 
these capital sums according to the funds  in which they chose to invest.
So, I didnt agree with the adjudicators view that Mr and Mrs M should receive interest at 
eight per cent per annum  simple for being prevented  from investing in their new ISA. And, as 
they invested their capital  in cash,  I also thought interest of one per cent above  Bank  of 
Ref: DRN28072342England base rate offered by Cofunds  for the delay in investing these funds elsewhere was 
too generous  as well. A more realistic rate of interest that reflects the return  Mr and Mrs M 
would have received from their new ISA since October 2018  is Bank  of England  base rate of 
0.75 per cent per annum.
But, even  though I proposed an interest rate as compensation for a loss of capital growth 
within an ISA, income  tax should  not be deducted from the calculated  amount as 
compensation is not taxable and ISA proceeds  grow free of income  tax and capital gains  tax 
in any event.
I invited both Mr and Mrs M and Cofunds to respond  to my provisional view, a copy  of which 
is attached and forms part of this final decision.
developments
Mr and Mrs M disagreed with my provisional findings and said that:
the optimum date for valuing  their ISAs of 28 August 2018 had been one of their 
contentions all along as the date seems to have been selected by Cofunds without 
good cause. They  maintain that a more realistic  date was 9 August 2018  and 
Cofunds has never satisfactorily explained why this date was inappropriate. So, they 
questioned why I had accepted Cofunds  view;
while I correctly confirmed that the ISA funds were sold on 21 September 2018, the 
valuations I quoted on that date are not correct. The actual values were £86,014.91 
and £73,093.22 respectively as shown on statements  issued by Aegon Cofunds on 
24 September 2018. They now realise that Cofunds final response letters also use 
the same  incorrect figures and dont accept my conclusion that Cofunds had correctly 
calculated their capital  losses;
they ask whether the tax Cofunds  has wrongly deducted from the interest for lost 
growth can be recovered from HMRC;
Cofunds continued to deduct  charges  from cash  held in the accounts;  for Mrs Ms 
account, until as late as February  2019. The cash has now finally been repaid without 
any refund of administration charges;
Cofunds should increase the compensation to take account  of all the above points;
It was now 12 months  since they raised this complaint with Cofunds, and they are 
disappointed that nothing much has changed since the involvement  of our service.
Cofunds responded, with evidence, to confirm that:  
it uses a third-party online system  for its dealings with ISA providers and managers 
and has no evidence  other than screenshots to record activity on accounts. These 
records show the receiving ISA manager  initially failed to provide bank details in the 
request to transfer on 13 August  2018.  The correct  information  was received on 23 
August 2018 and it was reasonable to conclude that the transfer ought to have been 
carried out by 28 August  2018.  While Mr and Mrs M may have received ISA 
valuations on 9 August  2018,  theres  no evidence they requested transfers  at that 
date;
the sums  that were transferred on 21 September 2018 included small cash  
distributions of £101.07  and £15.03 for Mr and Mrs M respectively that would usually 
have been reinvested. But, as they were received  as cash during the transfer 
process, they remained as cash and were excluded from the funds of £86,014.91 
Ref: DRN28072343and £73,093.22 that were sold to cash for the funds  to be transferred. It provided 
evidence to this effect;
cash distributions continued to be paid since the transfer in September  2018. For 
Mrs Ms account, payments were  made  until February 2019. So, in its view,  it was 
reasonable to apply  administration  charges  until the account was finally  closed.
findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that Mr and Mrs M had also stated in their Complaint Form that the ISA transfer forms 
were submitted to Close Brothers on 17 May 2018  and it took Aegon  until October to 
complete the transfers. 
I can see that Cofunds first received an electronic request from the receiving ISA manager 
for a valuation of Mr and Mrs Ms ISAs  on 23 July 2018. But this request was rejected as the 
Identification number  quoted didnt  match  Mr and Mrs Ms ISA wrapper numbers. Thereafter, 
the request was re-submitted on 13 August 2018  and, this time, the receiving ISA manager 
didnt provide its bank  details.
The request  was re-submitted a second  time on 23 August 2018 and, as such, it was 
reasonable to transfer the ISAs  at their value on 28 August 2018. 
The comparative values  of their ISAs on 21 September 2018  did include cash distributions of 
£101.07 and £15.03  respectively that were not included  in the statements received by Mr 
and Mrs M dated 24 September 2018 which showed  the value of the stock  that was sold for 
cash as £86,014.91 and £73,093.22. So, the transfer values of their ISAs  on 21 September  
2018, including cash distributions, were £86,115.98 and £73,108.25.
   
All things  considered, I see no reason  to alter the conclusions  I reached in my Provisional 
Decision.
decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr and Mrs Ms complaint.
To resolve  Mr and Mrs Ms complaint, I would require Cofunds Limited to recalculate for 
each of them redress of F to-date and to have  paid this sum into their respective ISAs with 
the new manager, where:
A = the notional  value of their Cofunds  ISAs on 28 August 2018;
B = the actual  value of their Cofunds ISAs on 21 September 2018;
C = interest on A at Bank  of England  base  rate of 0.75 per cent from 28 August 
2018 to 21 September 2018;
D = A  B = the shortfall in value  of their ISAs  due to the delay in making the transfer 
of funds;
Ref: DRN28072344E = Interest on D at Bank of England base rate of 0.75 per cent from 21 September 
2018 to-date;
F = C + D + E.
Having said that, I understand Cofunds  Limited has already paid the investment loss in D of 
£1,426.57 and £1,570.70  respectively to the ISAs  currently held by Mr and Mrs M when it 
issued its final response letters  on 14 January  and 30 January 2019 respectively.  
But, while I would have  expected Cofunds to pay interest in C and E into their ISAs as 
well, it paid interest of £118.82 and £171.98  direct to Mr and Mrs M. 
I would not have expected  Cofunds  Limited to deduct income  tax from the interest  awarded 
in C and E above because it is compensation for lost capital growth  and, in any event, 
ISAs grow free of income tax and capital gains tax.
Accordingly, Cofunds should calculate the total interest Mr and Mrs M are due in C and E 
to-date above,  with no deduction for income tax. If the total amount due is more than it has 
already paid to them  of £118.82 and £171.98,  it should pay each of them  the difference. 
Otherwise, if the total amount  due in C and E falls short of the amount Cofunds has 
already paid to Mr and Mrs M, I dont  require it to make any further payment of interest to 
them. But, in this event,  Mr and Mrs M may be entitled to reclaim from HMRC the income  tax 
Cofunds deducted from its gross interest calculations.
In addition, I agree that Mr and Mrs M should receive  £175  and £300 respectively for the 
trouble and upset  they have been caused in this matter. But, on the understanding that 
Cofunds has already  paid these sums  to them as well, I make  no further award for their 
trouble and upset.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  22 February  2020.

complaint
Mr and Mrs M have  complained  about the time taken  by Cofunds Limited in 2018 to transfer the value 
of a stocks and shares ISA they each held to another ISA manager. 
background
In response, Cofunds agreed that it had taken too long to carry  out the sale of the two ISAs and their 
transfer to Mr and Mrs Ms new manager. So, it looked to compensate them for the difference in the 
transfer value at the time the ISAs were transferred and their value when  they ought  to have been  
transferred.
Based on a timeline of events, Cofunds concluded  that Mr and Mrs Ms ISAs could have been sold on 
28 August 2018 for £87,542.55 and £74,678.95 respectively. When they were  sold on 21 September  
2018, they were valued at £86,115.98 and £73,108.25.
So, Cofunds  confirmed in final response letters to Mr and Mrs M on 14 January  and 
30 January 2019 respectively that Mr Ms ISA had been undervalued by £1,426.57 and 
Mrs Ms ISA by £1,570.70 and that these amounts would  be paid to their new ISA manager. 
It also paid Mr and Mrs M interest  at the rate of one per cent above Bank of England  base rate for lost 
growth on the full amounts  of £87,542.55 and £74,678.95 that could have been transferred 24 days 
earlier and on £1,426.57 and £1,570.70 from 21 September 2018 to the date of its final response 
letter. Interest would be subject to deduction of income tax at the basic rate of 20 per cent. 
Accordingly, it paid net interest of £118.82 to Mr M and £171.98 to Mrs M (which appears to have 
been calculated at 1.75 per cent above  base  rate). 
In addition, Cofunds paid Mr M £175 for the trouble and upset to which he had been put in this 
matter and Mrs M £300 as Cofunds had failed to acknowledge her complaint at all.
As Cofunds had provided Mr and Mrs M referral rights to our service before it issued its final response 
letters, they brought  their complaint to us on 4 January  2019 before  they knew the outcome of 
Cofunds investigation. 
Even so, Mr and Mrs M requested our service to continue investigating their complaint despite 
Cofunds issuing final response  letters on 14 January and 30 January  2019 upholding their complaint. 
They wanted  to be satisfied that the offers  made by Cofunds to resolve their complaints were fair and 
reasonable. They  confirmed  that the transfer values  to their new ISA manager has since been 
invested in un-invested cash for personal  reasons  and due to their concerns about global equity 
markets.
Mr and Mrs Ms complaint  was considered by one of our investigators, who felt that the basis for 
calculating Mr and Mrs Ms investment loss was fair given the timeline of events. He also thought the 
awards for the trouble  and upset Mr and Mrs M had been  caused of £175 and £300 respectively 
were appropriate as well.
But he did think that, as Mr and Mrs M had been deprived of the shortfall in value of their ISAs  since 
28 August 2018, we would expect Cofunds  to add interest from that date to the date the money  is 
actually paid at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple, and not with reference to Bank of 
England base  rate.
In response, Cofunds disagreed with the investigators view on the level of interest.  It argued that 
eight per cent per annum  simple is awarded when a consumer has been deprived  of money. Mr and 
Mrs M had not withdrawn  the value of their ISAs for spending needs. They had no plans for this 
Ref: DRN28072346money as it remained invested with their new ISA manager.  So, their loss since the transfer ought to 
have been made is the difference in the value  of the ISAs  at the respective  dates, plus the loss of 
investment growth on that shortfall in value to-date. As Cofunds didnt know how Mr and Mrs Ms fund 
were invested, an interest rate of one per cent above base rate was a fair and reasonable  measure of 
the investment  growth they have lost on this capital.  
Mr M responded to say that he couldnt accept Cofunds  argument  that eight per cent per annum was 
inappropriate because Mr and Mrs M had no plans to use the money. Cofunds  had never  asked them  
about their intentions for this money. The funds were transferred to their new ISA manager as cash  
and the full amount remains in cash to purchase a property in a more expensive area.  
  
As no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been referred  to me for review.     
provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr and Mrs M wrote a joint letter of complaint to Cofunds  Limited on 
31 October 2018 over service issues and a lack of confidence in the administration  of their 
investments and then the delay in transferring the value of their ISAs to a new manager.
Cofunds responded with holding letters after four weeks (on 12 November  2018)  and after eight 
weeks (on 28 December  2018) when it provided referral rights to our service in accordance  with 
regulatory rules. 
However, the two holding letters were addressed only to Mr M. The complaint  made  by 
Mrs M about her ISA transfer hadnt  been acknowledged.
Accordingly, Mr and Mrs M referred  their complaint to our service on 4 January 2019 before Cofunds 
issued a final response letter to Mr M on 14 January 2019, and to Mrs M on 30 January once it 
realised that it hadnt registered a complaint from her.
Based on the timeline of events set out by Cofunds, Im satisfied that it has fairly  calculated the capital 
loss suffered by Mr and Mrs M due to the delay in valuing their ISA prior to the proceeds being 
transferred to a new ISA manager.
The issue in dispute  is compensation for being deprived  of the greater value of their ISAs  24 days 
earlier.
Mr and Mrs M received  transfer  values for ISAs of £86,115.98 and £73,108.25 calculated at 21 
September 2018. They  ought  reasonably  to have  received transfer values  of £87,542.55  and 
£74,678.95 calculated at 28 August 2018.
So, for 24 days, they didnt receive  £87,542.55  and £74,678.95 and, since 21 September  2018, they 
received transfer  values  that were short  by £1,426.57 and £1,570.70 respectively.
Given Mr and Mrs Ms intention  was to invest  the ISA proceeds with another  manager, albeit  in un-
invested cash  within a stocks and shares ISA, they havent been deprived of this capital to spend 
since 28 August 2018. They have been deprived  of investment growth on these capital sums 
according to the funds  in which they chose to invest.
So, I dont agree  that Mr and Mrs M should receive interest  at eight per cent per annum  simple 
proposed by our investigator for being prevented from investing in their new ISA. And, as they 
invested their capital in cash, I also think that interest of one per cent above Bank of England base 
rate offered by Cofunds for the delay in investing  these  funds  elsewhere is too generous as well. A 
more realistic rate of interest that reflects  the return 
Ref: DRN28072347Mr and Mrs M would have  received from their new ISA since  October 2018 is Bank  of England  base 
rate of 0.75 per cent per annum.
But, as Im proposing an interest rate as compensation for a loss of capital growth within an ISA, 
income tax should not be deducted from the calculated  amount as compensation is not taxable and 
ISA proceeds grow free of income  tax and capital gains  tax in any event.
         
provisional decision
My provisional  decision  is that I uphold Mr and Mrs Ms complaint.
To resolve Mr and Mrs Ms complaint, I would have required Cofunds  Limited to pay redress of F into 
their respective ISAs with the new  manager, where:
A = the notional value of their Cofunds  ISAs  on 28 August 2018;
B = the actual value of their Cofunds ISAs on 21 September 2018;
C = interest  on A at Bank of England base rate of 0.75 per cent from 28 August 2018 to 21 
September 2018;
D = A  B = the shortfall in value  of their ISAs  due to the delay in valuation;
E = Interest on D at Bank of England base rate of 0.75 per cent from 21 September  2018 to 
the date of settlement;
F = C + D + E.
I would not expect Cofunds  Limited to deduct income  tax from the interest awarded in C and E 
above because it is compensation for lost capital growth in an ISA, which is free of income tax and 
capital gains tax.
In addition, Cofunds Limited should  pay Mr and Mrs M £175 and £300 respectively for the trouble and 
upset they have  been  caused in this matter.
Having said that, I understand Cofunds Limited  has already paid the investment loss in D of 
£1,426.57 and £1,570.70 respectively to the ISAs currently held by Mr and Mrs M when it issued its 
final response letters  on 14 January and 30 January 2019.   
But, while I would have expected Cofunds to pay interest in C and E into their ISAs as well, it paid 
interest of £118.82 and £171.98 direct to Mr and Mrs M. 
Accordingly, Cofunds should calculate  the total interest Mr and Mrs M are due in C and E above, 
with no deduction for income tax. If the total amount due is more than it has already paid to them of 
£118.82 and £171.98,  it should pay each of them  the difference.  
On the other hand, if the total amount due in C and E falls short of the amount Cofunds has already  
paid to Mr and Mrs M, I dont require  it to make  any further  payment to them.
Similarly, as Cofunds has already paid Mr and Mrs M £175 and £300 for the trouble and upset they 
have suffered, I make  no further award.
