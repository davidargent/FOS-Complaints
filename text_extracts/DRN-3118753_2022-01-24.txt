The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with the response he received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal) when he raised a dispute. 
What happened
What Mr H says
On 21 June 2021 Mr H used his PayPal account to buy an electric bike he found on a 
website for £360.90. Mr H then received a package from the seller that contained a ring and 
a card. The card said that due to the size of the bike it could only be sent by offline courier 
which would take more time. A tracking number was provided but there was no mention of 
which company was being used. The card also referred to the ring that was enclosed as a 
gift. 
The electric bike was never delivered, and Mr H was unable to contact the company that 
sold it, so he contacted PayPal to initiate a dispute and provided evidence.  
What PayPal says
PayPal say Mr H filed a complaint under its Buyer Protection Scheme on 14 July 2021. In his 
complaint Mr H said the item he had received was significantly not as described. In 
response, PayPal say that in accordance with its User Agreement and the terms and 
conditions of the account it asked Mr H to file a report with, the police or a government 
department. PayPal asked Mr H to send a report from either body within ten days of 19 July 
2021 and said that if it didnt hear from Mr H within the timeframe it may decide the dispute 
in favour of the seller. Mr H responded the same day and said the police dont deal with such 
issues and that he intended to repay the balance and close the account. On 21 July 2021 
PayPal denied Mr Hs claim as it said he failed to provide the evidence requested. 
In its submission to this service PayPal said Mr H told us he reported the matter to Action 
Fraud, but this wasnt consistent with what he told PayPal. PayPal states it has acted in 
accordance with the User Agreement and the terms and conditions of the account.  
Mr H would like the cost of the electric bike to be refunded.
Our investigation so far
The investigator who considered this complaint recommended it be uphold it. She said she 
was satisfied Mr H had been the victim of a scam and that PayPal had closed his case 
prematurely. The investigator concluded that Mr H had provided evidence that he contacted 
Action Fraud within the relevant timescale and so it would be reasonable for PayPal to 
refund him. 
PayPal didnt accept what the investigator said so the complaint has been passed to me to 
consider. In summary, PayPal said it previously provided compelling reasons not to uphold 
the complaint and that it has acted in accordance with the User Agreement and its terms and 
conditions. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr H is the victim of a scam and the scammer is responsible for Mr Hs loss in 
this case. He has provided evidence that shows he received a ring instead of an electric bike 
and that he tried to resolve the issue with the online seller before he contacted PayPal. What 
I need to decide is whether PayPal has acted reasonably in dealing with the dispute he 
raised with it.
To use its service all PayPal customers are required to agree to its online User Agreement. 
Amongst other things, this sets out how PayPal resolves disputes about items that do not 
arrive or are significantly not as described. These say,
To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:
Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time 
requested.
The agreement goes on to set out the steps a buyer must take to raise a dispute. Below I 
have quoted two of these steps,
Step 3: Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information, after you, the 
seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement. PayPal may require 
you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that 
PayPal specifies. You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in 
our correspondence with you 
Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision (including automatically closing any dispute or 
claim), in its sole discretion, based on the eligibility requirements set forth above, any 
additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other 
information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
So I accept that PayPal was entitled to ask Mr H for further information, including a report 
from the police. But I dont consider PayPal acted reasonably in making a final decision 
before the ten-day period given to Mr H to respond had expired. PayPals agreement says 
the information should be provided in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence 
with you. The request PayPal sent to Mr H asked him to respond within ten days of 19 July 
2021, but his complaint was closed two days later. Im not persuaded PayPal acted 
reasonably in doing so.  
Mr H has provided this service with an Action Fraud email dated 20 July 2021 
acknowledging his report to it. He is clear that he provided the Action Fraud email to PayPal 
at the time but has been unable to provide me with any evidence. This is because he sent it 
using PayPals messaging service and PayPal has declined to provide a record as it was 
more than 90 days ago. On balance, Im persuaded Mr H would have provided the Action 
Fraud evidence to PayPal when he received it and that this would have been within the ten 
days PayPal gave Mr H to do so. I see no reason why Mr H would have obtained this 
evidence if he didnt plan to pass it to PayPal. In the circumstances, Im satisfied that PayPal 
should refund Mr H £360.90 together with interest.
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
- Pay Mr H £360.90 together with any interest charges incurred as a result of this 
payment. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
