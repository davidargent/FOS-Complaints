The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) did not close his account 
with them when he requested. 
What happened
Mr R had a complaint with our service previously about his account with NatWest and his 
local branch closing down, and it was explained as part of that complaint how he could 
change his address with NatWest. It should be noted that I will not be commenting on any 
findings from that separate complaint.
Mr R sent NatWest a letter in which he asked them to close his account with them. He says 
the recorded delivery was signed for on 17 May 2022 by the NatWest branch, but they 
continued to say they had no record of this for around two weeks. His funds were eventually 
transferred to his nominated account on 15 June 2022. 
NatWest explained that the delays were due to Mr Rs address needing to be updated as 
well as identification checks. Our Investigator looked into the complaint and felt that overall, 
the delays were not unreasonable, so no compensation was due. 
Mr R disagreed and he pointed out that NatWest had given him incorrect information that 
they had not received his letter when in fact they had. 
As an informal agreement could not be reached, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the Investigator for largely the same reasons, and I dont direct 
NatWest to take further action. Ill explain why in more detail.
Mr R sent a letter to a NatWest branch dated 13 May 2022 in which he asked for his account 
to be closed. This also mentioned his new and old address but didnt specify it needed to be 
updated. I can see that this letter was received at the NatWest mail center on 18 May 2022 
and considering Mr R has said the letter was signed for by the branch on 17 May 2022, I 
dont think there were any significant delays up to that point. 
On 20 May a closure task was logged and set for 1 June on NatWests internal system, 
which was seven working days later. Looking at NatWests online guidance for account 
closures, there are varying time limits for when an account will be closed depending on how 
the request is received by NatWest. However, no timeframe is given for written requests. On 
balance, I dont think the initial timeframe of seven working days was unreasonable as its 
only a few days longer than the timeframe given for an online closure request. 
It wasnt possible to close the account on 1 June due to a mismatch in Mr Rs address. Mr R 
has confirmed he was sent a few texts in early June about his address being updated but 
says some information within the texts was incorrect. Despite this, NatWest was able to 
update his address on their system on 8 June seemingly by gathering the information from 
Mr Rs closure request letter and updating it that way. On balance, I dont think the delay of 
five working days was unreasonable.
The funds were then due to be released on 9 June, however this had to be cancelled as final 
identification checks were needed. NatWest was able to do this without Mr R being required 
to go into a branch to provide additional identification and as a result, the funds were 
released four working days later. Which I feel was a reasonable timeframe. 
I appreciate that when looked at as a whole, the length of time between Mr R sending his 
closure request letter and the funds actually being released does feel long. But when each 
action is taken into consideration separately, I dont think the delays were unnecessarily long 
and there were valid reasons for the delays at each point. 
Mr R has said he was told NatWest had not received his letter when they had. This appears 
to be due to a miscommunication between the branch that initially received the letter and the 
complaints department, as well the internal departments in NatWest not effectively 
communicating with each other. Because of this, Mr R became aware the letter had been 
received around two weeks later. While I appreciate this must have been frustrating, had 
NatWest not made this error I still think the reasonable delays would have occurred. And on 
balance, I dont think this warrants NatWest taking any further action.    
My final decision
I do not direct National Westminster Bank Plc to take any further action on Mr Rs complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2023.
