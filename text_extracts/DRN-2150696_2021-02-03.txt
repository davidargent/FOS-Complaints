The complaint
The estate of the late Mr S complains that a hire purchase agreement with Volkswagen 
Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Volkswagen Finance, under which a car was 
supplied, was misrepresented to him. The estate is represented by its executors who have 
authorised a representative to deal with the complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to the late Mr S under a hire purchase agreement with 
Volkswagen Finance that he signed in November 2015  the estates representative 
says that it was the late Mr Ss intention that the car finance would be transferred to 
him some time later and that that was discussed with the dealer;
but when the estates representative contacted Volkswagen Finance about the 
finance being transferred he was told that that couldnt happen;
sadly the late Mr S has since passed away and a complaint has been made to 
Volkswagen Finance that the hire purchase agreement was misrepresented to him  
but the estates representative wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service;
the agreement has ended and ownership of the car has been transferred to the 
estates representative  as was originally intended;
our investigator was satisfied that there was enough to suggest that a 
misrepresentation probably did occur and that the late Mr S wouldnt have entered 
into the agreement if the misrepresentation hadnt been made  but as the car was 
now owned by the estates representative, as was intended, he said that there was 
nothing that he could reasonably ask Volkswagen Finance to do to remedy the 
misrepresentation;
he recommended that Volkswagen Finance should pay £150 for the trouble and 
upset caused to the late Mr S  and it has accepted that recommendation but the 
estates representative, who acknowledged the investigators thorough explanation, 
says that he feels like more needs to be done to reprimand Volkswagen Finance for 
the error;
any misrepresentation in these circumstances was made by the dealer  and not by 
Volkswagen Finance  but, because it provided the credit to the late Mr S, 
Volkswagen Finance is also liable for any misrepresentation made by the dealer;
but this service offers an informal dispute resolution process and we try to resolve 
complaints by customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider 
to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances  we have no regulatory or 
disciplinary role over those businesses and our role isnt to punish a business if its 
done something wrong;
the hire purchase agreement has ended and the car is now owned by the estates 
representative  as was intended  and whilst I sympathise with the estates 
representative for the loss of the late Mr S and the difficulties that have been caused 
by the misrepresentation, I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Volkswagen Finance to take any action about the car;
our investigator recommended that Volkswagen Finance should pay £150 for the 
trouble and upset caused and it has agreed to do so  but Im only able to award 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience that was caused to the late Mr S 
(and not for the distress and inconvenience thats been caused to the estates 
representative); and
I consider that the late Mr S will have been caused distress and inconvenience by the 
dealers misrepresentation about the hire purchase agreement, but I consider that 
£150 is fair and reasonable compensation for that distress and inconvenience and 
Im not persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified in these 
circumstances.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Volkswagen Finance to pay £150 to the estate 
of the late Mr S as compensation for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold the estate of the late Mr Ss complaint and I order Volkswagen 
Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Volkswagen Finance, to pay £150 to the estate 
of the late Mr S.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr S 
to accept or reject my decision before 3 March 2021.
