The complaint
Mr R complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) hasnt provided him with a 
refund under its Purchase Protection scheme.  
What happened
Mr R bought an item online and paid using PayPal. He received the item but he noticed it 
wasnt the correct model which had been listed when he purchased it. He contacted PayPal 
to make a claim under its Purchase Protection. PayPal agreed to issue a refund when the 
item was returned. Mr R returned the item using a recorded and tracked service. And he 
provided PayPal with the tracking reference number.
PayPal contacted Mr R asking again for a copy of the shipping label used. Mr R didnt 
provide this, and PayPal declined his request for a refund saying Mr R had provided 
insufficient information. Unhappy with this, Mr R referred the complaint to our service. Mr R 
requested a refund of the £17 hed paid for the item and the £4.20 hed paid in return 
postage. 
The complaint was looked into by one of our investigators. He initially thought the complaint 
shouldnt be upheld as he noted that Mr R hadnt provided evidence that the item had been 
returned as the tracking number for the return wasnt recognised. Mr R disagreed. He said 
that had PayPal told him that the tracking number hadnt been recognised, rather than 
simply asking for the information again, he couldve looked into things further. Mr R noticed 
that the tracking number PayPal had tried was one digit out and the correct tracking number 
showed the item had been successfully returned.  
Our investigator reconsidered everything. He said that he could now see the item had been 
returned so PayPal should refund the money Mr R had paid for the item and pay him £50 
compensation.
Mr R accepted this, but PayPal didnt. So, the complaint has been passed to me to make a 
final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal initially declined Mr Rs claim because it couldnt verify the tracking number for the 
returned item. Its unclear whether the incorrect tracking number was provided by Mr R, or 
whether this was a mistake by PayPal when keying it in. However, we can now see that the 
item was successfully returned based on the correct tracking information.
PayPal has now said that Mr R couldve provided further information when requested but 
didnt, so it closed his case. However, it seems to me that Mr R was receiving very generic 
requests for information  information he believed hed already provided. Had it been 
explained to him that the tracking number hed given wasnt showing as correct, this may 
have enabled him to provide the information to correct this. I think PayPal shouldve been 
clearer in its communication with Mr R as to why it wasnt able to agree to a refund. 
PayPal is also saying that Mr R didnt respond within the timescales it set. But it only gave 
Mr R three days before deciding against him, which I think is an unreasonably short time. 
And in any case, as Ive explained, I think PayPal shouldve been more specific in why it 
wasnt able to currently verify the item had been returned  the tracking number being 
incorrect. PayPal had requested proof of shipment, but Mr R had already provided this. 
As Ive said, its unclear why PayPal initially had the wrong tracking reference. But it has the 
correct one now. And like our investigator, I feel it only fair that PayPal should now provide 
Mr R with the refund he requested.
Mr R had also requested the return postage be refunded. But I can see that PayPals terms 
require Mr R to pay for this, so Im not going to ask it to refund this.
I also think that this has caused Mr R frustrations and inconvenience which couldve been 
avoided had PayPal been clearer in its communications. I agree with our investigator that 
£50 is fair compensation for this.   
Putting things right
To put matters right, PayPal should:
Provide a refund of £17 for the item Mr R returned.
Pay Mr R £50 for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to put things right as 
set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2021.
