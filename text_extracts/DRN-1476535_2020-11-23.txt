The complaint
Mr H complains that Nationwide Building Society wont pay him any compensation for a 
holiday that he paid for using his credit card and which he says wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr H has described the issues that he had with the hotel and he says that the hotel 
wasnt of the appropriate standard for a hotel that was rated as four star by the 
holiday company  he says that he paid an additional €270 for meals at another hotel 
because of the issues with the food at the hotel;
he complained to the holiday company and it offered to pay him €150  he didnt 
accept that offer and complained to Nationwide; 
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Hs complaint about Nationwide, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that Nationwides response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
whether or not a hotel is of an acceptable standard can be very subjective and 
ratings are often used as a guide about the quality of a hotel;
the hotel was advertised as four star by the holiday company and is available from 
other holiday providers with an equivalent rating  its also given a four star rating 
by an independent travel platform - and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the hotel was misrepresented to Mr H;
Mr H clearly feels that the hotel wasnt of the appropriate standard and hes 
described issues with the service, cleanliness and food quality and he paid for meals 
at another hotel;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes experienced and understand the 
frustration and disappointment that he feels because the hotel wasnt as good as he 
was expecting it to be  but Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to 
show that those issues amount to a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
holiday company;
the holiday company has offered to pay €150 compensation to Mr H and I consider 
that to be a fair and reasonable response to his complaint - if he now wants to accept 
that offer of compensation I suggest that he contacts the holiday company to see if 
the offer remains available; 
Im not persuaded that Nationwides response to Mr Hs complaint was unfair or 
unreasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Nationwide to pay any compensation to Mr H or to take any other action in response 
to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2020.
