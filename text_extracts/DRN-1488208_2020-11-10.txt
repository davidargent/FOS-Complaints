The complaint
Ms A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA blocked her account for several 
months, and repeatedly gave her inconsistent information about when her account would be 
unblocked during phone calls.
What happened
Ms A had a business account with PayPal, in her own name. In March 2019 this account, 
which was relatively new, was blocked, and PayPal sent her an email asking her to send 
evidence to confirm her identity. Specifically, PayPal wanted to see an official identification 
document with her photograph on it.
Ms A sent PayPal a copy of her passport, but this was in her maiden name and her PayPal 
account was in her married name. So PayPal asked her to send a copy of her marriage 
certificate and another photo ID document in her married name. She provided the certificate, 
but she did not have any photo ID in her new name. So her account remained blocked until 
January 2020, when she sent PayPal her new driving licence in her new name. She says 
that as a result her business failed, as customers were unable to pay her, since all of her 
transactions were processed via PayPal.
Meanwhile, Ms A had made a number of phone calls to PayPal to ask when her account 
would be unblocked. She says that she was told by each call handler that this would be 
processed within 72 hours, but this always turned out to be untrue, as she would then 
receive emails telling her that her account would remain blocked until she provided 
everything that PayPal had asked her for. PayPal disputes that Ms A was ever told this, but 
when Ms A brought this complaint to our Service, our investigator accepted that what Ms A 
had described was true. She upheld this part of Ms As complaint on the ground that PayPal 
had provided poor customer service, and recommended that PayPal pay Ms A £150. But the 
investigator did not uphold the complaint about the block, as PayPals terMs And conditions 
said that this could happen, and PayPal had acted in line with the terms.
Neither party was satisfied with this opinion. Ms A insisted that her complaint was worth far 
more compensation than that, and PayPal did not accept that it had done anything wrong. 
Both of them asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to both parties for how long it has taken for 
this case to be assigned to an ombudsman. Cases are generally assigned in order of their 
age, and I completed this decision in the same week that it was assigned to me.
Having considered all the evidence placed before me, I agree with the investigators 
recommendation, and for broadly the same reasons. I will explain why.
I do not uphold the complaint about the block on the account. PayPal was entitled (and 
indeed obliged) to verify Ms As identity and to insist on photo ID to do so. Until that was 
provided, it was entitled to block transactions on the account, and I think it was reasonable to 
do so as this is a normal anti-money laundering practice. I accept that Ms A was not able to 
provide photo ID in her married name until January, and that that was not her fault. But 
equally, it was not PayPals fault either.
Turning to the complaint about being given contradictory information on the phone about 
when Ms As account would be unblocked, I have no reason to disbelieve or doubt what 
Ms A has told us about that. The investigator asked PayPal to provide call recordings to 
listen to, but the answer was that no call recordings would be provided. There is therefore no 
evidence to contradict Ms As account of events. Furthermore, Ms A had no way of knowing 
that evidence that could prove or disprove what she said would not be available, and in her 
email to PayPal dated 7 April 2019 she referred to having been told contradictory and 
misleading information in a phone call she had made on the day before. So I accept her 
testimony about this issue.
Putting things right
I know that Ms A feels very strongly about this matter, but I think that £150 is fair 
compensation for the customer service issue and is in line with what this Service would 
typically award. In coming to that conclusion I have taken into account how stressful the 
experience was for Ms A at the time, but I have also balanced that against the fact that 
PayPals emails were clear about what she had to do before her account would be 
unblocked. So while I appreciate that the phone calls raised her hopes temporarily, she 
ought to have known that PayPal was not going to unblock her account yet.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay Ms A £150.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2020.
