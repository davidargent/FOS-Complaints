The complaint
Mr O has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) is not clearly stating 
how much outstanding debt exists on his account. Mr O says the amount keeps changing 
and is shown in Euros. 
What happened
Mr O had contacted PayPal and a third-party debt collector to understand how much debt is 
left outstanding. However, Mr O says that the amount left outstanding kept changing and 
was quoted in Euros, rather than in Pounds. 
PayPal says that the debt in question was passed on to a third-party debt collection agency 
to collect the outstanding amount, although I understand that is no longer the case. It also 
says that as it reports the outstanding balance internally in other currencies other than 
pounds, this is why the amount owed will sometimes fluctuate.
In its response to the complaint, PayPal has acknowledged that the information it has 
provided Mr O has been confusing, and so agreed to remove £150 from the outstanding 
balance on his PayPal account to apologise for this.
One of our investigators assessed the complaint and they concluded that:
It was understandable that Mr O found the information he was being presented with 
as being confusing;
The amount owed is quoted in Euros as that is how PayPal reports the loss 
internally. As exchange rates fluctuate, this amount will change, but the amount owed 
in Pounds remains unchanged;
The debt was transferred to a third-party debt collection agency over five years ago, 
and Mr O can obtain information about how much is owed from them;
As of 20 April 2023, Mr O owed PayPal £2,001.04 for the Working Capital Loan that 
he took out in May 2018 and an outstanding (negative) balance on Mr Os PayPal 
account of £751.29.
The £150 deduction offered by PayPal was reasonable.
Mr O disagreed with the investigators assessment. He said that he is still none the wiser as 
to how the amounts owed were calculated and asked for a statement of accounts. He also 
pointed out that as the third-party debt collector was no longer administering the debt, 
PayPal was responsible for providing him with such information and to confirm what the plan 
of action was for the outstanding debt.
As Mr O was unhappy with the investigators assessment, he asked for the matter to be 
considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed this complaint, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator, for 
broadly the same reasons that the investigator gave. I will explain why.
I note that Mr O says that he is not aware of the Working Capital Loan. However, as this 
complaint only concerns the provision of data relating to outstanding debts owed by Mr O, 
Mr O will need to raise a separate complaint, if he wants to challenge that debt with PayPal. 
However, I would remind Mr O (as was explained in the final response letter) that there are 
time limits that apply to whether our service is able to consider such complaints against 
PayPal. 
Mr Os complaint seems to be a fairly straightforward matter - he simply wants a clear 
statement of accounts so that he can understand what outstanding amounts are owed (and 
when they were accrued) to PayPal and also so he can see how much of the debt hes 
already paid off. And in the circumstances, I think PayPal couldve provided clearer 
information to Mr O.
I can see that the amounts owed have fluctuated and I dont think PayPals explanation for 
this is reasonable. PayPal says that the amounts owed are quoted in Euros as that is how it 
reports the loss internally. However, regardless of how PayPal chooses to account for the 
outstanding amounts internally, I dont think its reasonable that PayPals internal reporting 
processes caused the outstanding amount that Mr N owed to appear to fluctuate, even when 
the amount in Pounds remained the same.
I understand that administration for the amounts in questions was previously assigned to a 
third party some time ago. As the debt is still owned by PayPal, PayPal is ultimately 
responsible for the debt. This means its also responsible for ensuring that Mr O is provided 
with clear and transparent information about the amounts left owing - so he can repay the 
correct amount and be assured that the amounts owed are correct. Since the third party is 
no longer involved with the debt, Mr O will need to contact PayPal about the debt. PayPal 
has said that if Mr O wants to get in contact, he should contact its Collections Negative 
Balance team on: 0800 587 0463.  
In the circumstances, I can see this matter has caused frustration for Mr O. So I think the 
£150 deduction from the outstanding amount on Mr Os PayPal account is reasonable. 
Ultimately PayPal has always been entitled to seek repayment of the full and correct amount 
thats outstanding, but by reducing this to acknowledge the circumstances of this complaint  
I think thats a fair and helpful gesture.
I note that since the complaint was referred for an ombudsmans decision, the investigator 
asked PayPal to provide a clear statement of account for the two debts. The investigator 
specifically asked that it included a running balance of the actual amount owed and a short 
label summarising each entry, so that Mr O understands what the credits and debits relate 
to.
PayPal responded with further information. Although rather frustratingly, it didnt provide a 
statement of accounts as such (at least not fully for both accounts). However, PayPal did 
provide a written narrative regarding the payments into and out of the PayPal account. This 
explained that a total of £1,361.30 was paid from the account, and Mr O had paid a total of 
£649.01 into the account, leaving £712.29 left to repay. 
PayPal also provided a partial statement of accounts for a Working Capital Loan as well as 
the terms and conditions. This explained that Mr O had borrowed £2,000 on 28 March 2018. 
This included a £159 fee added to the loan  making the total amount owed as £2,159. 
PayPal explained that Mr O repaid amounts of £11.08, £31.33, £33.69 and £15.86  totalling 
£91.96 in repayments. PayPal says this left £2,001.04 left to repay. Although the sums dont quite add up, I note that the amount PayPal says is left to repay looks to be lower than what 
can be calculated using PayPals figures (which indicates it should be £2,067.04).
I can see that Mr O has already made a subject access request to see information held 
about him on this complaint. So, Mr O shouldve already seen similar information from 
PayPal about the two debts that are left outstanding and the transactions that took place on 
those accounts. 
Mr O says he is none the wiser as to how the outstanding balances have been accrued. But 
having read through the information that PayPal has provided, Im satisfied that PayPal has 
provided reasonably detailed information, so as to explain how the debts on the two 
accounts were accrued. I say this as it explains the payments that were made into and out of 
the two accounts. As such, apart from deducting £150 from Mr Os PayPal debt, I dont think 
PayPal needs to do anything further.
Putting things right
PayPal has agreed to deduct £150 from the amount owed to it. In the circumstances I think 
this is reasonable.
My final decision
Because of the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and require PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) to do what I have outlined above, to put matters right, in full and 
final settlement of this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 January 2024.
