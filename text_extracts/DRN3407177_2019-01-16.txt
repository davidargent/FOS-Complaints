K820x#14complaint
Mrs G says HSBC  Bank Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold a Plus packaged bank  account  to her in 
2008. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators has looked into Mrs Gs complaint  already and didnt think HSBC  had     
mis-sold the packaged  account. The CMC asked  for an ombudsmans  review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Gs complaint. Having done so, I dont  think HSBC mis-sold  the Plus 
account to Mrs G. Id like to explain why I think thats the case. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Mrs G 
wouldve known she couldve had a free account  with HSBC if thats what  she wanted as she 
upgraded from one. Mrs G didnt apply for an overdraft at the time she upgraded. So I dont 
think that Mrs G only upgraded  because she was told she had to in order  to get an overdraft. 
I dont think the Plus account  was recommended to Mrs G. So it was up to Mrs G to decide  if 
it was right for her. Mrs G used some of the benefits  and couldve  used  others too. 
Im open  to the possibility Mrs G wasnt told absolutely everything she needed to know  about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest she wouldve been  affected by the 
main limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a 
difference and I think Mrs G was given  enough  to understand what  she was agreeing to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Gs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs G to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February  2019.
