K822xcomplaint
Mr R complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc unfairly blocked  and then closed his 
account without  notice. He said NatWest refused to give him access  to him money and his 
subject access request. He said NatWest  caused him stress and exacerbated his disabilities. 
background 
Mr R said NatWest told him he was eligible for its credit card but his accounts were  blocked 
and he couldnt  buy the food he needed. Mr R said NatWest  wouldnt tell him why it blocked 
his account and he had disagreeable conversations with branch staff who called the police to 
remove him. He said another customer threatened him with violence.
Mr R said NatWest then sent him a credit card with a separate letter  saying his credit  card 
account was closed along with his debit account.  He said he wasnt  given reasons for this or 
access to his statements  or funds in his NatWest account.
NatWest said it gave  Mr R notice it would  close his account following a decision by its 
Security and Fraud Department which was in line with the terms and conditions of the 
account. NatWest said its not obliged to give a reason for its decision. NatWest said it had 
allowed Mr R to access the funds  in his account four days  after it blocked his debit card.
The investigator said the complaint should  be upheld. He said banks,  like consumers, are 
entitled to end their relationship at any point  if they no longer  wish to provide their services.  
He said NatWest are required to follow the correct  process and it shouldve  given Mr R more  
than two weeks' notice.  He said considering  NatWests service to Mr R, and the impact of 
not having access to his money for four days,  NatWest should pay him £150 compensation. 
Mr R declined the offer of compensation  saying NatWest never gave him two weeks  notice,  
or a reason  for closing  his account.  He said the investigator failed to acknowledge NatWests  
cruel and unusual  behaviour,  its lack of adjustments to his disabilities and that it ignored 
disability discrimination. He said NatWests  actions are completely  against FCA regulations.
Mr R said NatWests terms dont mention not wanting to provide banking services  as a 
reason for closing  his account, and theres  a difference between  what  happened to him and 
the story  NatWest had given the investigator.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I havent considered Mr Rs complaint 
about NatWests  refusal to provide  his information  as this has been raised with the 
Information Commissioners Office.
Ive looked carefully  at NatWests handling of Mr Rs credit card account to see if it has acted 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of their contract and if it has treated him fairly.  
The investigator pointed  out that a bank can end its relationship with a customer as can a 
customer with a bank.  This isnt a reason or explanation of NatWests closure of Mr Rs 
account, but is a fact of banking contracts that allows  NatWest  to close an account it no 
longer wishes to maintain.
Ref: DRN80703792NatWest has said it closed Mr Rs account under  term 12.2 of their contract which states that 
NatWest can close  an account for a range  of conduct or fraudulent  actions. Frustratingly for 
Mr R, NatWest isnt obliged  to provide further or detailed  reasons for its actions, and we 
cant compel it to do so.
I have seen from NatWests records that it wrote  to Mr R that it would close his account in 14 
days time and that he should make alternative  arrangements. The letter  said that Mr R could 
access his account  balance at any branch of the bank. However, NatWest  had already  put a 
block on Mr Rs card and when he attended his branch he couldnt get money from his 
account. This situation lasted for four days and caused Mr R many difficulties.
I think the lack of warning  to Mr R about blocking his account  and the service  he received 
from NatWest  caused him difficulties  which were exacerbated  by his disabilities. Its clear  
that Mr R relied heavily on this account, and had difficulty in making  branch  visits, and 
subsequently in making alternative arrangements.
Im pleased NatWest has acknowledged  that it could have helped Mr R more than it did. Im 
sorry to learn about the impact this issue has had on Mr Rs physical and mental  health,  and 
having looked at all of the circumstances and events that occurred  to him I think additional 
compensation of £100 is reasonable, bringing the total to £250. NatWest has agreed to this 
compensation, but Mr R said that its not enough for what happened to him.
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  given it is my final decision that the complaint  is upheld  in part and I 
require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr R £250 compensation for its poor service.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
