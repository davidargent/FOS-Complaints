The complaint
Mr P has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted irresponsibly by 
providing him with an overdraft. 
What happened
Mr P held an account with NatWest and applied and was approved for an overdraft with a 
limit of £1,250 in October 2016. This limit was reduced to £1,000 in February 2017 and 
temporarily increased to £1,125 in November 2017 for a month to allow Mr P to make his 
loan repayments. 
Mr P complained to NatWest that it acted irresponsibly by approving an overdraft facility for 
him. NatWest didnt uphold the complaint. And as Mr P was dis-satisfied he referred the 
complaint to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ps complaint and thought that the initial overdraft 
lending was reasonable based on the information NatWest had and that the checks it carried 
out were reasonable and proportionate.   
Mr P disagreed, he says NatWest shouldnt have lent to him as he had £30,000 of debt on 
his credit file and has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
I issued my provisional decision on 5 September 2023. In my provisional decision, 
I explained why I was proposing to uphold Mr Ps complaint. I invited both parties to let me 
have any further submissions before I reached a final decision. Both NatWest and Mr P have 
confirmed receipt of my provisional and accepted my findings regarding NatWests overdraft 
lending decision although Mr P is disputing how NatWest have proposed to apply any refund 
of interest, fees and charges applied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I said that:
NatWest needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is it needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand whether Mr P would 
be able to repay what he was being lent before providing any credit to him. Our website sets 
out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks were 
proportionate. 
And in this case Im not persuaded NatWest checks went far enough. I say this as at the 
time NatWest approved Mr Ps overdraft limit of £1,250 in October 2016 I can see that Mr P 
had already taken out two loans with NatWest in the months leading up to it  £5,000 in 
March and £7,500 in May. And although I havent seen a copy of Mr P credit file at the time 
Mr Ps bank statements show a number of payments going out to service borrowing in the 
form of credit cards and loans with other providers. Yet this information doesnt appear to be 
considered when assessing the affordability of Mr Ps overdraft application.
Mr Ps overdraft application data shows that he had an income declared of £1,500, existing 
loan and credit card payments with it of around £360, living costs worked out as £546 
leaving a affordability of £591. But there is no figure in the affordability assessment for rent 
or mortgage costs or other external lending. 
I can also see Mr Ps bank statements show in the month before the overdraft was granted 
gambling transactions amounting to £500. So based on this information Im not persuaded 
further lending of £1,250 was affordable for Mr P and that NatWests checks went far 
enough.
Indeed, Mr Ps statements show within a month of being provided with his overdraft he hit 
the top of his limit and wasnt able to see or maintain a credit balance again for more than a 
few days after his salary was paid in. 
If NatWest had carried out the appropriate checks and properly considered the amount of 
debt Mr P had and the amount of credit already available to him, I think it is likely that 
NatWest wouldve realised Mr Ps income wasnt enough to service the borrowing he already 
had and that he would have difficulty repaying further lending. 
So I currently dont think NatWests checks went far enough when it approved Mr P for an 
overdraft limit of £1,250 and I think NatWest acted unfairly when it charged overdraft interest 
and associated fees from October 2016. NatWest ought to have realised that it was unlikely 
Mr P would have been able to sustainably repay the overdraft within a reasonable period of 
time given the amount of debt and credit he already had available to him. 
So I currently think that NatWest didnt treat Mr P fairly and he lost out because of what 
NatWest did wrong. 
As neither party has provided any further evidence or arguments for consideration regarding 
the lending and have accepted my provisional findings, I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusions set out in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold this complaint. 
In my provisional decision I said that NatWest should put things right by reworking Mr Ps 
overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges applied to it from October 2016 are 
removed. If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Mr P to arrange a suitable repayment plan for this.  
NatWest have told us that Mr Ps account was defaulted in October 2020 and it wrote off the 
outstanding balance of £1,012.09. NatWest say that overdraft interest, fees and charges 
applied to the overdraft from October 2016 amount to £288 and that this amount will be used 
to reduce the outstanding write off balance.
Mr P says the refund should come to him directly as the overdraft was part of an Individual 
Voluntary Agreement (IVA) which has since been paid off and fully completed. It has been 
explained to Mr P that when he was in the IVA he only paid a percentage of the outstanding 
debt and that he wouldnt have paid the full amount of the outstanding overdraft debt with 
NatWest off. 
As the IVA has come to an end NatWest can no longer pursue Mr P for the outstanding debt, 
but NatWest can use the refund to reduce this and cover its loss  which I think is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold Mr Ps complaint against National Westminster Bank 
Plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 October 2023.
