The complaint
Mrs M complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to her 
the money that she paid for some holiday club points. Mrs M is being represented in this 
complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs M and her husband had some holiday club points and they entered into a purchase 
agreement with a holiday company in September 2012 to buy 40,000 more holiday club 
points. Mrs M used her Barclaycard credit card in October 2012 to pay Â£5,102.55 to the 
holiday company for those points. The holiday company provided Mrs M and her husband 
with a letter which confirmed that they could surrender their points after the fifth year of 
membership with no additional costs.
Mrs Ms representative claimed a refund of the cost of the holiday club points from 
Barclaycard under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in November 2016. It said 
that there had been misrepresentations and breaches of contract by the holiday company. 
Barclaycard said that the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship that was required for a claim 
under section 75 had been broken so the claim didnt meet the criteria for section 75. It also 
said that its liability under section 75 was for a breach of contract or misrepresentation but 
not a breach of law or directive which would be a breach of statutory duty. Mrs M wasnt 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator said that there was a relevant debtor-creditor-supplier relationship in these 
circumstances, which was accepted by Barclaycard, but he didnt recommend that Mrs Ms 
complaint should be upheld. He didnt agree that there had been misrepresentations or 
breaches of contract by the holiday company. He also considered Mrs Ms claims under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but he didnt consider that there was an unfair 
relationship. He said that the evidence available didnt appear to support the claim for a 
refund.
Mrs Ms representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that a timeshare product has been sold to Mrs M and her husband 
which is unusable, which is illegal and which has cost them thousands of pounds. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ms complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that Barclaycards response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms claim under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that;
Mrs M and her husband bought 40,000 holiday club points under the purchase 
agreement;
those points were in addition to the points that theyd previously bought and which 
were granted in perpetuity;
subsequent to Mrs M and her husband signing the purchase agreement, the holiday 
company confirmed that:  should you decide to surrender your [holiday club 
points] membership, partially or in its totality, you may do so after your fifth year of 
membership with no additional costs ;
Mrs M and her husband received the 40,000 holiday club points under the agreement 
and also received the right to surrender the points that had been granted in 
perpetuity;
its clear that the points that Mrs M and her husband had bought previously were 
granted in perpetuity but I dont consider that the points that they bought under the 
purchase agreement in September 2012 were granted in perpetuity;
Mrs Ms representative has referred to a 2015 court judgment from the country in 
which the holiday club was based about the illegality of timeshare products in 
perpetuity  but that judgment was made three years after Mrs M and her husband 
signed the purchase agreement and I dont consider that the purchase agreement 
was illegal at the time that it was made or that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company;
Mrs Ms representative also says that the holiday company has breached the EU 
timeshare directive and other laws about timeshares  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company has failed to comply with 
any legal requirements for which Barclaycard would be liable under section 75 or that 
the holiday club points are unusable;
Mrs M has described how she says that the purchase agreement was sold to her and 
her husband and her representative says that they were advised that the only way 
they could exit their membership was to purchase more points, that their son would 
be responsible for the management fees after their deaths and that the new owners 
of the timeshare company had issued proceedings against a great many people for 
unpaid maintenance fees;
much of that relates to what she says she was told by the timeshare company but 
theres no written record of what was said by the timeshare company and Im not 
persuaded that Mrs M has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company misrepresented the holiday club to her and her husband or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by a misrepresentation made by 
the holiday company;
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs M and her husband believed that they were 
entering into a contract with the holiday club owner and that their payment was made 
to another company which was a misrepresentation;
the name of the company that was selling the holiday club points to Mrs M and her 
husband was clearly set out in the purchase agreement and was also confirmed 
elsewhere in the documents - the payment was made to another company but Mrs M 
received the benefit of the payment even though it was made to another company and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was a 
misrepresentation about the contracting parties;
our investigator considered Mrs Ms claim under section 140A and concluded that the 
relationship between Barclaycard and Mrs M wasnt unfair  but the claim that was 
made to Barclaycard by Mrs Ms representative in November 2016 didnt include a 
claim under section 140A so Barclaycard wasnt given an opportunity to respond to 
that claim in its final response letter  so Im unable to consider a complaint about a 
section 140A claim as part of this complaint;
if Mrs M wants to make a claim under section 140A, she should make a claim to 
Barclaycard and then, if shes not satisfied with its response, she may be able to 
make a complaint to this service  but from the evidence that Ive seen I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the relationship between 
Barclaycard and Mrs M was unfair in these circumstances;
I dont consider that Barclaycard properly considered Mrs Ms claim under section 75 
so I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to her claim  but I 
consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claim if it had properly considered it as it 
would have said that there hadnt been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the holiday company; and 
I sympathise with Mrs M and her husband for the issues that theyve had with their 
holiday club membership and the difficulties that Mrs M has described, but I find that 
it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclaycard 
to refund to her any of the money that she paid for the holiday club points, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
