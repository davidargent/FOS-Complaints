The complaint
R, a limited company, is unhappy with National Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWest) handling 
of an application made on behalf of his company to open a business account. 
What happened
The company director of H ran an existing company (which Ill call Company 1) and says he 
was advised by his accountant to set up a second company - R. Rs accountant sent a letter 
to HMRC explaining the change, and this was accepted. In August 2019, the director of R 
made an application to open a second business banking account to NatWest for R.
 
NatWest told the director he needed to provide more information before they could proceed 
with the application. Rs director says hes provided this information during a number of calls. 
He became frustrated with the time being taken to open the new account for R, and what he 
considered to be requests for information he has already provided on a number of 
occasions. As a result, the director complained. 
In September 2019, NatWest sent its final response letter to Rs director. It acknowledged 
the service it had provided could have been better and apologised for this. The letter noted 
Rs director had another appointment to try and complete the application process. 
NatWests business account opening team continued to ask Rs director for information, and 
he considered he had answered NatWests questions as well as he was able to. In October 
2019, NatWests business manager said the bank was unclear of the purpose of the new 
company. He said they needed more detail from Rs director about the processes previously 
outlined. The business manager said the bank required a step-by-step breakdown of all the 
processes taken by R and how this would connect to Company 1 when the new account 
would be open. NatWest also asked for information about how the two companies would be 
linked, how profits would be distributed, and dividends paid.
Rs director considered hed provided this information by both phone and email. He said he 
wouldnt know some of this information until R started trading. He made another complaint to 
NatWest. 
NatWest responded to the complaint and offered Rs director £300. It said it should have told 
the director much sooner that more information might be needed in order to open his 
account. However, NatWests position remained unchanged, saying Rs director needed to 
provide more information before it could proceed with the request to complete the application 
for the second account. 
Rs director says hes been significantly impacted by the delay in opening the account. He 
says hes lost business and experienced mental anguish. To put things right, hes looking for 
the account to be opened and for compensation of £3,000 to be paid.
One of our investigators considered this complaint. She said that she could see there was 
information outstanding NatWest had asked for R hadnt provided  namely the step-by-step 
breakdown of the processes involved. Satisfied the bank had asked reasonable questions 
and offered £300 for some poor service issues, she didnt recommend it do anything more to 
put things right. As R didnt agree, this matter has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In the first instance, I think its important to clarify that the requirements of any bank might be 
different to other official organisations. So I do not think that because Rs director says 
HMRC accepted his accountants explanation for setting up a new company places the same 
obligation on NatWest.
Ive considered the information given to R by NatWest, and its agreement it initially gave R 
conflicting information. I can see this has been frustrating for Rs director who believed he 
had provided all the information required to proceed with the account application. I consider 
that NatWests offer of £300 in recognition of the trouble and upset Rs director experienced 
as a result of this is fair and reasonable. 
I also understand Rs directors frustration NatWest hasnt been able to provide details of all 
the conversations they had. However, both sides broadly agree on the content of those 
conversations, with Rs director setting out how he intended to his existing business to work 
between Company 1 and R. 
However, in October 2019, NatWests business manager relayed the information required to 
move forward with the application for the new account for R. At this point, I consider it was 
made clear the information R had provided about the processes the companies used were 
not detailed enough for NatWest to proceed with the application. 
While Rs director provided more information to this service which was relayed back to 
NatWest, NatWest said this still does not go into the level of detail required to proceed with 
the application. 
Im satisfied NatWest has been clear in setting out the level of detail R needs to provide. And 
the reason the application has not progressed is because R has not provided the step-by-
step breakdown required. Im not intending to direct NatWest to open the account  which 
goes beyond the powers of this service - as Rs director requested. It follows I dont agree 
NatWest needs to pay any more by way of compensation than it has already offered.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask R to accept or reject my decision before 3 June 2021.
