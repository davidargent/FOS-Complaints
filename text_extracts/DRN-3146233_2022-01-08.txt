The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that NewDay Ltd wont remove two defaults which were applied to his 
account.
What happened
Mr P held two credit card accounts with NewDay. In 2016 Mr P was unable to make 
payments because of his medical condition. Mr P says he thought hed reached an 
agreement with NewDay to pay a nominal amount each month, but that despite this, defaults 
have been registered on his credit file. Mr P complained to NewDay and asked for the 
defaults to be removed.
In response, NewDay said it hadnt entered int a payment agreement with Mr P on either of 
his accounts. It said that recorded defaults when the accounts fell into arrears and that the 
accounts had now been sold to a third party.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said he couldnt see anything in the records 
provided by NewDay to suggest that a payment agreement had been reached and said that 
NewDay hadnt done anything wrong in recording the defaults on Mr Ps credit file.
Mr P didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where arrears reach three months, a lender can register a default, even if an arrangement to 
pay has been agreed. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 says that a lender must issue a notice 
of default setting out what the consumer needs to do to bring the account back up to date 
and tell the customer the date by which this needs to happen.
In this case, I can see that Mr P had two accounts. It looks like arrears accrued because Mr 
Ps direct debit was cancelled. I can see that when both accounts reached three months in 
arrears, NewDay issued a default notice. Im satisfied that NewDay acted in line with the 
terms and conditions of the account when it did this. Im also satisfied that it acted in line with 
relevant legislation.
Ive looked at the system notes and template letters which NewDay sent to Mr P about his 
account. Ive also listened to a call recording from June 2016. Based on what Ive seen, Im 
satisfied that NewDay took reasonable steps to advise Mr P that his account was in arrears, 
and of what he needed to do to bring the accounts up to date.
In the telephone call between Mr P and NewDay, Mr P acknowledged that hed missed some 
payments. The adviser explained to Mr P that he needed to bring both accounts up to date 
and asked Mr P if he was struggling to pay. Mr P didnt say that he was experiencing 
financial difficulties but said to the adviser that he would look into why the payments hadnt 
been made and would call back the following week. I cant see anything to indicate that Mr P 
called back.
Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied that Mr Ps accounts were in arrears. Although Mr P 
made some nominal payments to his accounts, I cant see anything to suggest that a 
payment arrangement was agreed. Even if a payment arrangement was agreed, both 
accounts were three months in arrears, so I cant say NewDay did anything wrong by 
recording the defaults on Mr Ps credit file.
Mr P has said that he thinks that NewDay shouldve treated him as a vulnerable customer. 
Hes said that because of his medical condition, it was unlikely that he would be able to 
repay the accounts and NewDay shouldve written them off.
Ive reviewed all of the available information, but I cant see anything to suggest that Mr P 
told NewDay about his medical condition. I dont think its fair to expect NewDay to treat Mr P 
as a vulnerable customer if it hadnt been made aware of his vulnerabilities. And I cant see 
that it was made aware. Because of this, Im unable to say that NewDay acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in its handling of Mr Ps accounts.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2022.
