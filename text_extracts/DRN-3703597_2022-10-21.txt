The complaint
A, a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed its 
accounts. A also complains that NatWest didnt return all the money that belonged to it when 
the bank closed its accounts. And continued to send out account statements.
As complaint has been brought to our service by its director, Miss L.
What happened
A had three business accounts with NatWest. A sterling account and two Euro accounts. In 
January 2021 NatWest blocked and reviewed As accounts. Following its review, NatWest 
decided to close As accounts with 14 days notice. At the time As sterling account balance 
was just over £200 and the Euro accounts just over €900.  NatWest closed As sterling 
account and released the balance to Miss L. But it didnt close As Euro accounts properly 
and continued to send A account statements.
Miss L complained to NatWest about the closure of As accounts. She explained that the 
closure and block on As accounts stopped incoming credits resulting in a loss of around 
£100,000 to A, made it difficult for her to pay staff wages and resulted in her having to use 
an overdraft facility on another account to meet As VAT expenses. 
NatWest looked into things and accepted it had made mistakes when it closed As accounts 
in January 2021. NatWest said due to an oversight it hadnt closed As Euro accounts or 
returned the balance in those accounts to A. NatWest released the outstanding balance to 
Miss L in September 2021. The bank also apologised to Miss L and offered to pay her £300 
compensation for any trouble caused by the delay in releasing the funds and continuing to 
send out account statements. 
Miss L declined NatWests offer and said it didnt adequately reflect the amount of 
inconvenience and financial losses the bank had caused A by closing its accounts. Miss L 
also pointed out that even after the bank had acknowledged it had made a mistake, she 
continued to receive bank statements which meant she had to spend time trying to sort out 
what was happening. And that the bank had deducted a transfer fee of €31.50 when it 
eventually released the outstanding account balance, which she thought was unfair.
Unhappy with the banks response, Miss L brought As complaint to our service where one of 
our investigators considered it. Miss L told the investigator that A suffered losses of around 
£100,000 of commission payments from clients due to them being unable to send payments 
to As NatWest accounts. And she provided invoices of payments A was expecting in 
support of what she said. 
The investigator said NatWest was entitled to review As account and had done so in line 
with its legal and regulatory obligations. She said that whilst the closure of As accounts 
wouldve made it difficult for Miss L to run her business, NatWest hadnt done anything 
wrong when it decided to close As accounts. However, she said NatWest didnt release As 
funds when it should have and continued to send account statements from a closed account. 
To put things right she said NatWest should pay £100 in addition to the £300 compensation 
already offered and refund the €31.50 transaction fee. 
NatWest agreed with the investigators recommendations. Miss L didnt. So, the matter has 
come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, as the investigator has already explained, NatWest has extensive legal and 
regulatory responsibilities they must meet when providing account services to customers. 
And to fulfil these obligations they may need to review activity taking place on accounts and 
ask customers for information  its entitled and obliged to carry out such checks. The terms 
of As account also permit NatWest to review an account. 
Having looked at all the evidence, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances for 
NatWest to block As accounts. NatWest has explained that this was its standard procedure, 
and I accept that it was. Im satisfied that in doing so NatWest were complying with its legal 
and regulatory obligations. So, whilst I accept, the banks actions caused A difficulties when it 
decided to block its accounts, I cant say the bank did anything wrong and treated A unfairly in 
doing so. So, it wouldnt be appropriate for me to award A compensation since I dont find the 
bank acted inappropriately in taking the actions it did.  
I then turn to the banks decision to close As accounts. Its generally for banks to decide 
whether or not they want to provide, or to continue to provide, banking facilities to any 
particular customer. Unless theres a very good reason to do so, this service wont usually 
say that a bank must keep a customer or require it to compensate a customer who has had 
their account closed. As long as they reach their decisions about that in a legitimate manner, 
this service wont usually intervene.  
NatWest provided some further details of its decision making process, Im sorry but I cant 
share this information with A due to its commercial sensitivity. But Ive seen nothing to 
suggest NatWests decision around closing As accounts was unfair. Im satisfied here that 
the banks decision to stop providing A with banking facilities was reached legitimately and 
fairly. 
Banks should give reasonable notice before closing an account. Usually, that means 60 
days notice, but it can be less  depending on the circumstances. In this case NatWest 
closed As accounts with 14 days notice. Having looked at all the evidence, in my view that 
wasnt unreasonable. And Im satisfied that the bank acted in line with the account terms and 
relevant regulations. 
I know Miss L is seeking compensation of around £100,000 to cover financial losses she 
says A incurred as a result of NatWest closing As accounts. And she has submitted 
evidence in support of what shes said. Ive looked at the paperwork Miss L has provided, 
and Im not convinced this shows A lost any money. In any event it wouldnt be appropriate 
for me to award any compensation since I dont find NatWest acted inappropriately. 
Turning to awards for non-financial loss there isnt a set formula that we use to calculate 
awards for particular mistakes or poor service. Its my role to consider what impact 
NatWests actions have had on A and decide, within guidelines set by our service, whether 
compensation would be appropriate in the circumstances. Based on the evidence Ive seen I think its fair to say the delay caused by NatWest not 
releasing As Euro account balance when it should have and continuing to send out 
statements caused A, inconvenience.  And I agree some compensation is appropriate for 
this. I say this because Miss L had to wait several months for NatWest to release As funds 
and spent time away from running her business trying to find out what exactly was 
happening with As Euro accounts. And its only right that NatWest recognises this. Im 
satisfied that £400 is a fair amount of compensation and proportionate to the trouble A was 
caused. In addition, NatWest should also refund A the €31.50 which it deducted when it 
released As funds in September 2021.
In summary, Im sorry that my decision is likely to come as a disappointment to Miss L as 
she would like NatWest to pay A substantial compensation. But for the reasons Ive 
explained,  Im not going to direct NatWest to do anything further. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Miss L a total of £400 compensation for the inconvenienced caused and refund €31.50.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
