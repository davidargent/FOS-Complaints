The complaint
Mr R and Ms S complain that they took out a five-year fixed interest rate mortgage with 
Barclays Bank UK PLC, but the fixed rate doesnt run for five years.
What happened
Mr R and Ms S applied for a mortgage with Barclays in July 2019. On Barclays 
recommendation, they applied for a five-year fixed interest rate product of 2.05%. Barclays 
approved their application and issued a mortgage offer on 10 July 2019. The mortgage 
completed in mid-September 2019. 
Mr R and Ms S say they recently realised that their fixed interest rate is set to end on 31 July 
2024, and this isnt what they signed up to  they expected a fixed rate for five years, not 
four years and ten months. They want the rate to be fixed until 30 September 2024.
Mr R and Ms S complained to Barclays. Barclays sent them a brief resolution letter which 
Mr R and Ms S considered unsatisfactory. They referred their complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service.
Our Investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He said the 
mortgage offer was clear that the fixed rate would end on 31 July 2024.
Mr R and Ms S didnt accept that conclusion and asked for an Ombudsman to make a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms of the mortgage that Mr R and Ms S and Barclays agreed to are set out in the 
mortgage offer dated 10 July 2019. The mortgage product is described as 5Yr Fixed 
2.05%. The offer document also says:
2. Main features of the loan
Amount and currency of the loan to be granted: £520,000.00
Duration of the loan: 34 years
This is a repayment loan of £520,000.00 on a fixed rate that will apply from completion 
until 31 July 2024.
After 31 July 2024 the rate that will apply is a variable rate []
On the following page of the offer, at section 3, headed Interest rate and other costs, it 
says:
Interest rate(s)
Step 1: A loan of £520,000.00 on a fixed rate of 2.05% that will apply from completion 
until 31 July 2024. 
The offer also says, as Mr R and Ms S have pointed out, that they would be making 60 
payments at the fixed rate. That, however, was on the basis of the mortgage starting on 
1 August 2019  which is also clearly set out in the offer, under 5. Amount of each 
instalment, which says: These payments are based on a loan amount of £520,000.00 and 
assume the mortgage will start on 01 August 2019. 
While the product is described as a five-year fixed rate, Im satisfied that the 31 July 2024 
end date for the fixed rate is clear and prominent in the mortgage offer. When Mr R and 
Ms S applied for this particular product, there were in fact more than five years left to run on 
it. The exact length of time for which a borrower would have the fixed rate was dependent on 
the mortgage completion date. Had Mr Rs and Ms Ss mortgage completed earlier, they 
might have had the full five years, or more, at the fixed rate. The end date of the product, 
however, remained the same at 31 July 2024.
This arrangement was not unusual at the time Mr R and Ms S took out their mortgage, and I 
dont consider that it was unfair or that Mr R and Ms S were misled. The rate end date was 
clear in the offer, and Mr R and Ms S accepted the mortgage on the basis of that offer. And 
even if I were to find that Barclays didnt make that clear, I dont think it would make any 
difference to the outcome of this complaint. Thats because Barclays didnt have any rates 
available which ran for exactly 60 months from completion. So if Mr R and Ms S wanted a 
rate that ran for around five years  rather than, for example, a two-year rate  they would 
always have ended up with the rate they actually took.
Finally, Mr R and Ms S have said theyre unhappy with Barclays response to their complaint. 
Barclays sent them a very brief resolution letter, having apparently misunderstood that it had 
resolved their complaint over the phone. I think that was unhelpful, but I dont find that Mr R 
and Ms S have suffered any detriment as a result. I therefore make no order or award.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R and Ms S to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 December 2023.
