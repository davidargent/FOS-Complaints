K821x#15complaint
Miss W says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly 
lent to her. She says she couldnt  afford the loan repayments and had to borrow  further.
background
This complaint is about 31 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss W between  August 2015 
and April 2017. Miss Ws borrowing history  is attached as an appendix  to this decision.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Miss Ws complaint and partially upheld it. He thought  the 
loans from loan five onwards  shouldnt have been given. And that for loan five any adverse 
information about that borrowing should  be deleted from Miss Ws credit file. From  loan six 
onwards he concluded that all the information  about  those loans was adverse, so all the 
records about loans  six to 31 should be deleted  from Miss Ws credit  file. 
Sunny disagreed but it did offer to update its previous assessment of the complaint. It had 
originally offered to uphold the complaint from loan 19 onwards but after further review 
offered to uphold from loan 13 onwards.
The offer was put to Miss W but she disagreed.
In the meantime, a second adjudicator looked  at the complaint. He agreed the complaint 
should be upheld  from loan five but that all adverse information being  removed from 
Miss Ws credit file should occur from loan eight onwards, rather  than loan six.
Neither party commented on the second adjudicators amendment to the outcome. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN44458632the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss W didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss W had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint.
As both our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan five would most likely  have  
shown that:
It looked likely that Miss W was having problems managing her finances. She had 
taken five loans  in six weeks and three loans in September 2015  alone. Her 
borrowing in that month increased from the £250 borrowed in the August to a total of 
£350. So, her repayments were  also increasing.
Miss W was repaying the loans  early which while I appreciate can save  interest  on 
the borrowing, it can also an indication that a consumer may be borrowing further to 
repay current borrowing.
Miss W was also borrowing further before previous borrowing was paid off. When  
loan four was taken  loans two and three were still outstanding. This increased her 
monthly repayments when it looks like she was already struggling with her finances.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN44458633was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ws case, like the second  adjudicator,  I think that 
this point was reached  by loan eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss W was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out eight loans within four months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss W was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ws first loan in August 2015 was for £250,  her borrowing in September  was for 
£350 and in October this increased again to £400. Loan  eight was for £150  which  
was increased by two further loans in that month  making  a total of £450.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Miss W was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  31 was 
taken out 20 months after Miss Ws first. Miss W had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss W lost out because  Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan five onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do  I have also included  loans from loan 
13 onwards for completeness
refund  all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  five to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN44458634remove any negative information  about loans five to seven  from Miss Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  eight onwards should  be removed 
from Miss Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 April 2020.
