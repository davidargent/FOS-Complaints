K822xcomplaint
Mr F complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  refused to let him take out a 
new mortgage product.
Mr F also complains  that NatWest did not record the complaint  he made to branch staff. Mr F 
says he feels NatWest  made registering his complaint unnecessarily  stressful and time 
consuming.
In order to resolve this matter Mr F wants NatWest to allow him to take out a new mortgage 
product and to compensate him for the problems he experienced  when he complained.  
background 
Mr F took out a five year fixed rate product with NatWest in late 2013. In mid 2018 Mr F 
wanted to apply for a new mortgage product, as his existing  product was due to end shortly.
It then came to light that, under NatWests  lending criteria, Mr F was not eligible for a new 
mortgage product  as his mortgage  balance was less than £25,000. So once Mr Fs existing 
mortgage product  ended in October 2018 he would have to transfer  to its standard  variable 
rate.
Mr F felt NatWests  policy was unfair  and he raised this with branch staff. It appears that 
Mr Fs concerns were  not recorded as a complaint at the time. Mr F says he had to make 
three trips to his NatWest branch before his complaint was registered.
Mr F said NatWest  should have made him aware that he wouldnt be able to apply for a new 
mortgage product  if his mortgage balance was less than £25,000 when he applied  for a 
mortgage product  in 2013. 
NatWest did not uphold Mr Fs complaint. It said it didnt think it had acted incorrectly  by not 
covering this point  when  Mr F applied for a new mortgage product in 2013. It also said its 
policy not to offer new mortgage products to customers with a mortgage balance of less than 
£25,000 was under review. But it said a final decision hadnt been made on whether to 
change its policy on this.
Mr F wasnt satisfied  with NatWests response and brought his complaint to this service.
Our adjudicator said that he didnt think NatWest could have foreseen what Mr Fs situation  
would be when his five year fixed rate ended, when it advised him in 2013. He said five 
years was a long timeframe and it would have been difficult  for NatWest to have predicted 
what Mr Fs circumstances would be. He also said NatWest is entitled  to set its own lending 
criteria and policy when deciding which mortgage  customers to offer new products to.
He noted that NatWest  had recently  changed its policy and, from 9 November 2018, it would 
allow customers with a mortgage balance of £10,000 and over, to apply for new mortgage 
products. 
In relation to the difficulty Mr F had when he raised  his concerns with branch staff,  our 
adjudicator said he felt Mr Fs complaint should have been recorded promptly by branch 
staff. In particular he said Mr F shouldnt have had to make three trips to the branch before 
his complaint was recorded. 
Ref: DRN62450302In order to compensate  Mr F for the trouble  and upset this poor service had caused  our 
adjudicator said NatWest should pay Mr F £100. He said he had spoken  to NatWest and it 
had agreed to pay Mr F £100  for the poor service  he had received.
Mr F did not accept our adjudicators view and asked for his complaint to be determined by 
an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think the settlement suggested  by our adjudicator is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Ill explain why.
As our adjudicator noted, NatWest is entitled to set its own lending  criteria. I can understand  
why Mr F felt it was unfair that he was prevented from applying  for a new mortgage product 
because his mortgage balance was below £25,000.  But I cant  reasonably  say that NatWest  
isnt allowed to set its own policy. I note that it has now changed this policy  and customers 
with a mortgage balance of over £10,000 can now apply for new mortgage products.
I appreciate that Mr F feels  NatWest should have made  him aware  of its policy  when he 
applied for a new mortgage product in 2013.  But I dont think  it is reasonable to say NatWest 
should have been able to foresee what its policy on mortgage products for existing 
customers would be in five years time, or to have been able to predict whether its policy  
might impact  Mr F.
But I do think that NatWest let Mr F down when  he raised his concerns with branch staff.  It 
didnt record Mr Fs complaint and instead sent him away  with a leaflet that explained he 
could complain in-branch. It appears it then put further barriers in his way by telling Mr F that 
he would  have to make an appointment with the branch manager if he wanted  to register  a 
complaint.
I think NatWest  should  compensate  Mr F for the trouble and upset its poor service caused 
him. I am satisfied that the £100 recommended by our adjudicator is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN62450303my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2019.
National Westminster Bank Plc has agreed to pay the £100 recommended by our 
adjudicator for the poor service Mr F experienced when he complained. I simply leave it to 
Mr F to decide if he now wishes to accept this offer.
