The complaint
Mr V has complained that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) has incorrectly 
calculated the increases to his benefit amount. 
What happened
Mr V has an income protection insurance policy with Aviva. He made a claim which was 
accepted and has been in payment since 2019. The benefit amount has been increased 
each year as per the policy terms. But Mr V doesnt think Aviva has calculated the increases 
correctly. 
Mr V complained to Aviva and it explained how it had calculated the increases each year. Mr 
V remained unhappy and referred his complaint to this Service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think Aviva had done anything wrong. 
She said it had calculated the increases in line with what was set out in the policy terms and 
conditions. 
Mr V disagreed. He referred to key definitions of RPI versus CPI, inflation, indexation and 
the rates from the correct period between 2019 and 2022.
And so the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think this complaint should be upheld. And largely for the same 
reasons as already explained by our investigator. 
The policy terms
The policy terms and documents make up the contract of insurance between Mr V and 
Aviva. These set out how the policy increases are applied each year based on the option 
chosen. Mr V chose the increase by RPI option. The relevant term says:
Increase in your benefit amount based on the percentage increase in the latest 
available Retail Price Index (RPI) over the 12 month period ending 12 weeks before 
the start of the month of your policy anniversary date
Mr Vs policy anniversary date is 23 June every year. 
Aviva has provided data showing the percentage amounts by which increases were applied:
23 June 2022  7.84%
23 June 2021  1.38%
23 June 2020  2.69%
23 June 2019  2.54%
23 June 2018  3.95%
Mr V seems to be suggesting that the method of calculation is incorrect but I think the 
increases have been applied correctly, based on the policy terms. 
Taking the 2022 increase as an example, Ive checked the Office for National Statistics 
website for the relevant values. This shows the following information:
The RPI percentage increase, over 12 months, ending 12 weeks before the start of the 
policy anniversary, amounts to 7.84%.
The calculation is 320.2 (value from February 2022)  296.9 (value from March 2021) = 
23.3/296.9 = 0.078777 * 100 = 7.84%.
Based on the above information, Im satisfied Aviva has correctly increased the benefit in 
line with the policy terms and conditions. Mr V has referred to CPI and the cost of living. But 
the automatic increases applied by Aviva are based on the method specified in the policy 
terms.
So based on the above, I dont think Aviva has done anything wrong, and I wont be asking it 
to do anything further. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2023.
