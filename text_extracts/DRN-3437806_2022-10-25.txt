The complaint
Mr L complains that HSBC UK Bank plc (HSBC) didnt raise a chargeback request on his 
behalf. He would like a refund of £32.75 for a transaction he says he never authorised.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
The Chargeback Scheme is a voluntary one governed by a set of rules laid down by 
the relevant card scheme. The Scheme sets out the rules for when a chargeback is 
allowed and what is expected of the parties involved. Banks dont have to use the 
scheme but we do expect them to try to obtain a refund if the evidence supports a 
claim.  
HSBC concluded that there was no evidence to support a chargeback claim and from 
what I have seen I would agree with this. Mr L  doesnt dispute making the payment 
but  says the payment should have been for £14.85 not £32.75. However,  he has no 
evidence to support this  for example a receipt. Additionally, the payment in 
question was a contactless one, so one Mr L would have been able to see the 
amount on the card machine prior to making the payment. 
As Mr L couldnt provide any evidence to support his claim for a chargeback , and 
banks do need evidence to progress such claims , I dont think HSBC were wrong not 
to pursue a chargeback on Mr Ls behalf.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2022.
