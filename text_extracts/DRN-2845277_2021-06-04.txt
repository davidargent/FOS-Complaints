The complaint
Ms K (by the way of a representative) has complained that Short Term Finance Limited 
(STF) gave her unaffordable loans.
What happened
Our adjudicator partly upheld Ms Ks complaint. STF did not agree with the adjudicators 
opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision explaining the reasons why I was partly upholding Ms Ks 
complaint. I gave both parties an opportunity to respond and to provide further information 
and / or evidence. A copy of the background to the complaint and my provisional findings 
follow this and form part of this final decision.
What I said in my provisional decision:
Ms K took 28 loans from STF between November 2013 and January 2019. A summary of
her borrowing, based on the information provided to us from the lender, can be found below.

STF has told us that the two final loan balances were written off so there is currently no
outstanding balance to pay on these loans.
Prior to our initial investigation, STF confirmed Ms K had taken 24 loans (loans 5  28 in the
table above). So, our service based our initial investigation on Ms K having only taken 24
loans because this is what STF had told us.
However, after completing a further investigation into Ms Ks loans, STF confirmed Ms K was
approved 28 loans, which is what it initially said in the final response letter it issued. But it
has only provided limited information about the loans. STF says it didnt look into Ms Ks first
four loans as it believes these loans were out of our services jurisdiction to consider them as
they were taken out more than six years ago.
Although STF hasnt said so, I believe it is referring to the time limits that this service must
abide by when considering cases. This says the service cant consider a complaint about an
activity if it occurred more than six years ago or more than three years after a consumer
knew or ought to have known she had reason to complain.
Subsequently, we asked Ms K for further information about these loans. Ms K asked our
service to proceed with her complaint. I took from this that Ms K didnt want our service to
investigate loans 1 - 4. So, this decision will only be focussing on loans 5-28, and whether
STF was wrong to approve them.
One of our adjudicators looked at Ms Ks complaint. He didnt think STF was wrong to
approve loans 5-7. But he thought that STFs checks should have gone further for loans 8
and 9. But, as Ms K had not provided information showing what her circumstances were like
at the time of these loan applications, the adjudicator couldnt say that STF was wrong to
have approved them
.
But by loan 10, the adjudicator thought STF ought to have realised that Ms Ks pattern of
lending was showing signs that these loans had become unsustainable for her. So, the
adjudicator upheld loans from loan 10 up until Ms Ks last loan.
It appears that Ms K agreed with our adjudicators opinion.
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment and provided the following points:
STF believes it carried out proportionate checks every time Ms K requested credit.
Evidence of her income was collected by the agent.
STF says that, had Ms K not approached them for a loan, she may have approached
other lenders, or approach unlicensed credit providers.
The pattern of lending Ms K had was typical for this type of product.
STF then provided this service further details about the types of checks that were
carried out in two different periods. Firstly between 2014 and 2018. And then from
2018 to present, when a new online application was introduced.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final
decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms K could
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and the
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that STF should fairly and reasonably have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that STF was required to establish
whether Ms K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation
.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Ms Ks complaint.
Loans 1-4
STF says it did not look into Ms Ks first four loans as it believes these loans were out of our
services jurisdiction to consider them as they were taken out more than six years ago.
When we asked Ms K for further information about these loans, she asked for our service to
proceed with her complaint without considering the checks STF completed for these loans. I
therefore make no finding about whether these loans were lent correctly. Instead, this
decision will only be focussing on loans 5-28, but I will still consider loans 1-4 as part of Ms
Ks overall borrowing history.
What I would also say is that the information in the table above is all the information STF has
supplied about these early loans. But, given the term of the other loans, I dont think its
unreasonable to conclude they were likely leant with a term of 16 weeks, given that I thinkits likely there were either no gaps between loans, or gaps of only a few days and / or
weeks.
Loans 5-7
Ms K applied for her fifth loan around six weeks after she was approved for loan 4. STF
asked Ms K to declare her weekly income and expenditure. Ms K told it she had a weekly
income of £289.46 and her weekly expenditure amounted to £84. This would have left Ms K
with a weekly disposable income of £205.46 from which to meet the contractual weekly
repayments for loan 5 of £35.
Whilst the information that Ms K declared about her circumstances suggested the loan
repayments were affordable, I think, at this stage in the borrowing relationship, STFs checks
ought to have gone further to understand if Ms K was in a position to sustain them.
I say this because this was Ms Ks fifth loan without any significant breaks in between loans.
Whilst STF has provided limited information about Ms Ks earlier loans, she was taking out
loans every three months. And considering her borrowing history overall, I think it was likely
she was running her earlier loans in the same manner as she did for her later ones  by
taking out further borrowing as soon as she repaid a loan. Furthermore, loan 5 was Ms Ks
largest loan to date.
With this in mind, I think STF should have obtained more evidence in order for it to verify the
information she was telling it about her weekly income and expenditure for loan 5 and any
subsequent borrowing. This would have allowed the lender to see at first-hand what Ms Ks
financial circumstances were like.
In these circumstances, I would consider what proportionate checks would have revealed for
loans 5-7. But Ms K has not provided us with any information, such as her bank statements
or credit file, showing what her finances were like at the time of her loan applications. So, in
the absence of any information showing Ms Ks actual circumstances, Im unable to
conclude that loans 5-7 were unaffordable for Ms K, or that STF was wrong to approve these
loans.
Loans 8-28
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 8 to 28 because I
didnt consider it necessary to do so. Indeed, Id be inclined to think that from loan 8, STFs
checks really needed to go further than just relying on the information Ms K told it.
I acknowledge that STF took proof of Ms Ks income via its agent. But at this point in the
lending relationship, I think it ought to have been trying to verify her income and overall
expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of Ms Ks actual financial position.
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to
Ms K, STF needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during the
course of its lending relationship with Ms K. I do think STF was wrong to have provided
loans 8 to 28 because Ms K wasnt in a position to sustainably repay them for the following
reasons:
By loan 8, STF ought to have realised Ms K was not managing to repay her
loans sustainably. This was Ms Ks eighth instalment loan within 20 months, and she
had been indebted to STF for this whole period. Whilst I dont know the loan terms for
her later loans, the loans up to this point were due to be repaid in 16 weekly
instalments. So, 20 months after she started borrowing, shed been granted a further
seven loans with each new loan likely taken the day the previous loan was repaid.
Whilst we have limited information about her first four loans, I think it was likely Ms K
was using them in the same manner as her later loans. This pattern in my view isnt
of someone who is able to manage their money, given how quickly she was returningfor borrowing.
Loan 8 was the joint largest loan to date of £350. At this point STF ought to have
known that Ms K was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income
but to meet an ongoing need.
From the earlier loans that Ms K took, she tended to be provided a new loan on the
same day that the previous one was settled. Again, this indicates to me that Ms K
had a long term need for funds rather than using them to cover a temporary shortfall,
and that making repayments was leaving her in need of further borrowing.
Ms Ks first loan was for £150 and loan 8 was for £350. This to me shows that Ms K
wasnt reducing her indebtedness to STF  in fact, it had increased. Although she
was repaying loans in line with the credit agreements, she wasnt actually making
any headway into reducing her overall capital balance. She was in fact, in effect
paying STF interest to service a debt of £350.
I think that Ms K lost out because STF continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ks indebtedness by allowing
her to take credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time coupled with the number of loans which Ms K borrowed was likely
to have had negative implications on Ms Ks ability to access mainstream credit and
so kept her in the market for these loans.
So, I think STF were wrong to approve loans 8-28.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time the loan was provided. 
Ms K (by the way of her representative) agreed with the outcome reached in the provisional 
decision and she didnt have anything further to add. 
STF did not respond to the provisional decision, so I dont know, what if anything, it thinks 
about the outcome. 
So, I see no reason to depart from the findings I reached in the provisional decision and I still 
think STF was wrong to have provided loans 8  28 to Ms K. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it stopped lending to Ms K from loan 8, as Im satisfied it ought
to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that
question. Indeed, STF has mentioned that Ms K might have gone elsewhere to borrow
money.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms K may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnta viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Ms K in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms K would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
I think STF were wrong to approve loans 8-28.
STF has told Ms K in the final response letter that the outstanding balance for loans 27 and
28 were written off. If STF wrote off any unpaid principal, then I think its fair that STF is able
to recover this principal from the refund below.
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms K towards interest,
fees and charges on loans 8 - 28, including payments made to a third party where
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms K
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms K originally made
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. STF may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which
it has written-off for loans 27 and 28.
D. STF should pay any remaining refund to Ms K. If there is no refund left and still a
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for it to
pursue this further.
E. The overall pattern of Ms Ks borrowing for loans 8 - 28 means any information
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Ms
Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. STF should give
Ms K a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, Im partly upholding 
Ms Ks complaint.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right for Ms K as Ive directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 July 2021.
