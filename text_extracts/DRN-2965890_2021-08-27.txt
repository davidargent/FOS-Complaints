Hamsard only has the point of sale documents (such as the income and expenditure 
information it collected) from loan 7 onwards.
Miss P complained to Hamsard about her lending and received a final response letter. 
Unhappy with the response she referred the case to our service. 
An adjudicator reviewed the case. She thought, taking into account the gaps in lending 
(which meant that Miss P had three lending chains) the checks Hamsard carried out for 
loans 1  8 and loan 19 went far enough. However, for all other loans the adjudicator thought 
Hamsard needed to carry out more in-depth checks. 
But, the adjudicator was able to partly uphold the complaint because in her view loans 14  
18 were unsustainable for Miss P taking into account the time in debt, amounts borrowed 
and her pattern of lending. 
Miss P has accepted our adjudicators findings. But she also added that at no point was she 
asked for evidence of her income or her outgoings. She also told us she was invited to take 
further credit and she found it hard to turn down due to being in financial difficulties. 
Hamsard didnt agree, and in response it made a number of points. In summary it said;
had Hamsard not provided the credit its likely Miss P wouldve gone to other credit 
providers (both regulated and unregulated)
Hamsard didnt increase Miss Ps borrowing in an unsustainable manner
Miss P approached Hamsard for lending and its loans are no different to that of a 
credit card
Miss P didnt raise a complaint (before this one) to say she was dissatisfied, she was 
also given a welcome pack which contained a complaints leaflet 
Hamsard is not a payday lender, it is a home credit provider and so the agent that 
visited Miss Ps home was able to build an understanding of her circumstances 
Miss P took loans out on the same day (and so should be treated as one request) but 
these loans ran for different periods of time, which shows Miss P understood what 
she was agreeing to
Hamsard follows the rules laid down by the industry regulator  the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA)
following a recent court case Hamsard says that if redress is due then this service 
needs to consider that she wouldve gone elsewhere for credit, so there should either 
be no redress due or a significant discounted amount should be repaid. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time these loans were provided.
Hamsard needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss P 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Hamsard should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Miss P. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult tomeet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Hamsard was required to establish 
whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint. 
Loans 1-13 and loan 19
The adjudicator didnt uphold these loans, and Miss P has accepted the adjudicators 
outcome. Hamsard also appears to have accepted her findings about these loans. 
So, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about them. But, for the avoidance of 
doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about this 
lending. And as these loans form part of the overall borrowing relationship Miss P had with 
Hamsard, they are something I have taken into account when considering the later loans she 
took.
Loans 14 - 18
In this decision I wont go into the rules and regulations that Hamsard needed to adhere to 
during the relationship with Miss P. We have explained to Hamsard what these are in detail 
through other final decisions it has received, and the published decisions on our website. So, 
Im not going deal with these points at length here. 
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe the loans Miss P took as high cost 
as does the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within 
its identified high cost credit portfolio. Unlike credit cards, which Hamsard has mentioned.  
While I note it has a longer term than, for example, a payday loan, that does not make it a 
low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these 
products can be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on 
this point. I have considered these issues alongside everything else in making my decision.
Ive also noted what Hamsard says about the welcome pack and providing information about 
how to complain. But that isnt the issue in this case. Im considering whether Hamsard carried out proportionate checks and or whether it ought to have been aware that the lending 
was unsustainable for Miss P.  
Ill firstly say that Ive not found what Hamsard says about its checks to be persuasive in 
demonstrating the loans were either affordable or sustainable. It looks like, based on what 
has been provided, that Hamsard took the same sort of information for each loan, that being 
asking Miss P about her income and her expenditure.  
For loan 14, Hamsard took information about Miss Ps income (which included part time 
wages and benefits). It also looks like for this loan, Hamsard verified her identity via her 
passport and it looks like it also saw Miss Ps bank statements. And even then, the bank 
statements seem to have been used to verify Miss Ps identity rather than as a way of 
checking the income and expenditure information she had provided.  
So, Im not clear how Hamsard can say it carried out proportionate checks when, as Ive said 
above, it doesnt appear to have changed the type or level of checks despite Miss P 
returning for new loans fairly regularly over an extended period of time.
I appreciate what Hamsard says about the fact Miss P regularly took two loans on the same 
day (with different terms) and therefore it should be treated as one request. But, due to the 
term, Hamsard provided two credit agreements, and its reasonable to say that Hamsard had 
to be satisfied that Miss P would be in a position to service both loans at the same time. 
Although Hamsard says that there is no record of Miss P raising her concerns earlier. It 
doesnt mean she didnt have any financial difficulties, and Im not sure what bearing that 
has on the case. What Im considering is whether Hamsard did anything wrong when it lent 
these loans  in line with the rules and regulations at the time. 
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 14-18 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below.
I would say, by this time that a proportionate check, in my view, wouldve been verifying the 
information Miss P had provided. Hamsard couldve done this a number of ways, it couldve 
asked for evidence of her income, and her outgoings via the way of copies of bills. Or it 
couldve asked to see a copy of her bank statements and used them to verify the information 
Miss P has provided  which as Ive said above, Im not sure this happened in this case. 
Based on what Ive seen, Im not convinced that any of the checks on the loans from loan 14 
to 18 were proportionate. 
But, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Miss P, Hamsard also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded 
during the course of its lending relationship with Miss P. 
I think Hamsard was wrong to have provided loans 14 - 18 because Miss P wasnt in a 
position to sustainably repay them for the following reasons:
By loan 14, Miss P had been indebted to Hamsard for just over two years. During this 
time, she had taken eight loans with terms of up to eight months, but most of the 
loans were due to be repaid within five to six. And she frequently had overlapping 
loans.  So Hamsard ought to have realised it was more likely that Miss P was having 
longer term problems as her need for credit continued.
Miss P appeared to be showing signs that she needed to borrow a new loan as soon 
as (or close to) settling a previous loan. She was granted loan 14 on the same day 
loans 12 and 13 had been repaid. Loan 12 was also taken out the same day that loans 9 and 10 were repaid. A similar pattern continued during the whole lending 
relationship. This continued need for credit ought to have alerted Hamsard to 
consider whether the loans were sustainable.
Miss P was regularly making repayments to a number of loans at the same time. This 
suggests that Miss P wasnt making any real reductions to the amount she owed 
Hamsard. She went on to exhibit the same pattern of borrowing for her subsequent 
loans  and at times had at least three loans running concurrently.
Loan 14 was one of Miss Ps largest capital loan to date and loan 15 was also 
running at the same time, meaning she owed (in capital) £286. The total repayments 
due at this time were around £20.50 per week which is about double the amount 
Miss P initially paid for her first loan, in this chain of lending. The weekly repayments 
didnt sustainably decrease over the remaining borrowing period. Indeed, when loans 
17 and 18 were running concurrently, the weekly repayments came to the same 
amount as when loans 14 and 15 were running. So, Miss Ps overall indebtedness to 
Hamsard didnt significantly decrease over the time she borrowed. 
Miss P didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed Hamsard. Loan 18 was 
taken out was taken out 29 months after the first loan in this chain of lending. But, it 
was over four afters after Miss Ps first loan.  And this loan of £176 was both larger 
than Miss Ps first loan (and first loan in this chain of lending).  Miss P had paid 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Hamsard over an extended period.
I think that Miss P lost out because Hamsard continued to provide borrowing from loan 14 to 
loan 18 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing
her to take relatively expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Miss P borrowed and the time she spent in debt was likely 
to have had negative implications on Miss Ps ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these loans.
So, overall, having considered everything Im upholding Miss Ps complaint as I think 
Hamsard were wrong to approve loans 14-18 for these reasons.
Putting things right
In its submissions to us, Hamsard has talked about the 2020 High Court judgement in the 
case of Kerrigan vs Elevate Credit International Limited. Hamsard drew on the Courts 
findings to question assumptions about what might have happened had it declined the 
lending in question, and so Miss P had had to apply to a third-party lender and as a result 
Hamsard says there should be either no redress paid (or a reduced amount to take account 
of this potential other lending.)
In deciding what redress Hamsard should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Miss P from loan 14, as Im satisfied it ought 
to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that 
question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss P may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Miss P in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Miss P would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Hamsards liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Hamsard shouldnt have given Miss P loans 14-18 and it should take the following steps to 
put things right. 
a) Hamsard should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss P towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans.
b) Hamsard should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Miss P which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss P 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
c) Hamsard should pay Miss P the total of A plus B.
d) The overall pattern of Miss Ps borrowing for loans 14 - 18 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Hamsard should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Ps credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Hamsard should give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Miss Ps complaint in part.
Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance should put things right for Miss P as directed 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
