Miss G says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 48 loans Sunny provided to Miss G between  July 2014 and 
November 2017.  A summary of Miss Gs borrowing  history is shown in a table at the end of 
this decision.
Miss G says Sunny didnt  carry out sufficient affordability checks to assess that she could 
reasonably afford the loan. And she says the debt was stacking high to pay off her loans 
from previous months. She says she had terrible  stress and should not have been lent to or 
been able to borrow and she certainly shouldnt have been  able to continuously get loans  to 
cover the previous loan repayment.
Sunny said it had carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks before lending to 
Miss G and it considered  that Miss G was managing  her other debts and it was responsible 
to advance the credit. But it said that at certain points the product may not be suitable for her 
needs. It offered  to put things right in relation to loan number (ended 6756).  This was the first 
loan provided  to Miss G.
Our adjudicator said she hadnt seen enough to say it was unfair for Sunny to provide 
Miss G with loans 1- 7. But she didnt think loans 8- 48 should have been given. She said the 
repayment for loan 8 represented a significant proportion  of Miss Gs income.  
Sunny disagreed with this view. It said it said it had already agreed to uphold  her first loan, 
so this was a review  of her instalment loans only. It said the repayments  were  a small 
proportion of Miss Gs income.  On further  review  however, it agreed to partially uphold  Miss 
Gs complaint from loan 28 onwards. It said, the total refund due including the first loan 
would be £894.23.  It also said it would amend Miss Gs credit file for all the affected loans in 
line with our recommendations. As the parties havent agreed the complaint has been 
passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss G could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN32697682the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss G could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Gs complaint. Having  done  so, Ive decided  to 
uphold this complaint from loan 8 onwards. I will explain why.
I think the checks Sunny did before agreeing to provide  Miss G with loans 1-4 were 
proportionate. The amounts that Miss G needed to repay would have seemed to be 
affordable compared  with the disposable income  shed declared.  Taking  account  of the 
repayment amounts  for these loans, Miss Gs circumstances and thinking about the fact that 
this was in the early  stages of her relationship with Sunny, I dont think Sunny needed to ask 
for further  information  from Miss G before agreeing to lend.
Following loan 4 Miss G did not borrow again for a period of 8 months. I dont think it was 
unreasonable for Sunny to provide loans 5-7. Im satisfied that the checks  it carried  out were 
proportionate and wouldnt have indicated that the loans were unaffordable. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 8 and 9 would most likely have 
shown that the combined repayments of loan represented a significant  proportion of 
Miss Gs income which she would have had to maintain for several months.  Considering 
there were still other loans outstanding  when  she took out loan 8, I dont think  Miss G would 
have been able to maintain repayment of this loan in a sustainable manner. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN32697683was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Gs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss G was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss G had taken out around 12 loans  (including the drawdowns 
from the flex credit). And whilst  there was a break  in the lending between loans 4 and 
5 Miss G and Sunny  had an overall  lending relationship for around  16 months. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Miss G was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Gs first loan (after the break  in lending between  loans  4 and 5) was for £150  
and loan 10 was for £250. At this point Sunny ought to have known that Miss G was 
not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in her income but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
From  loan 10 onwards  Miss G was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one and she often had multiple outstanding loans at the same time.  
Miss G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 48 was 
taken out around 16 months after loan 5 (the first loan in this chain). And the amount 
hadnt reduced. Miss G had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt 
over an extended period.
I think that Miss G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss G borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept him/her  in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8-9 and from loan 10 onwards  and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss G paid on loan 8-48;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 8 and 9 from Miss Gs credit  file;
Ref: DRN32697684the number  of loans taken from loan 10 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  10 should be removed from 
Miss Gs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 March  2020.
