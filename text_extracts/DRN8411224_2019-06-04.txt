K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  irresponsibly lent to him. 
He wants a refund of the interest he paid and references removed from his credit file.
background
This complaint is about 32 payday  loans  with top ups provided to Mr R between May 2015 
and May 2018.  Mr R borrowed continuously from CashEuroNet and there were no significant 
gaps in his borrowing over the three years between  loan 1 and loan 32. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. CashEuroNet disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for 
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Ref: DRN84112242Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should  have realised  
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
By loan 7 Mr R had been borrowing  continuously and in quick succession from 
CashEuroNet. Mr R had requested 7 loans within a 4 month period.
When Mr R asked for loan 7, he was provided  with a new loan within  a couple of 
weeks of settling  a previous  one. So CashEuroNet ought to have realised  it was 
more likely than not Mr R was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed CashEuroNet and the 
amounts he tended  to borrow didnt decrease at all. Mr R had paid interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to CashEuroNet  over an extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
Mr R had been requesting loans from CashEuroNet  for around 36 months  from loan 
1 to loan 32.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Rs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint about  loans  7 to 32 and CashEuroNet should put things 
right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 7 to 32;
Ref: DRN84112243pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 32 should be removed from   
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Rs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr R compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
