Mrs P complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly.

The RCF is different to the instalment loans. The RCF allowed Mrs P to either request funds 
up to her agreed credit limit in one go or take multiple drawdowns up to that limit. It appears 
Mrs P had a credit  limit of £500. Each drawdown could be repaid via five monthly 
instalments. 
In our assessment our adjudicator thought  Sunny hadnt made  an error when it gave Mrs P 
her RCF. But he thought  it was wrong for Sunny to have granted  all of the instalment loans 
(loans 2  20). 
Mrs P appears to have  accepted what our adjudicator said. 
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  recommendation, in response it made a number of 
points including  that the loans were affordable and Mrs P didnt fall into arrears with any of 
her loans. However, it did tell us it had carried out a review of the complaint and it now felt 
that loans 10  20 shouldnt have been  given. And it made an offer to settle the complaint on 
that basis. 
Ref: DRN89057472This offer was put to Mrs P but she didnt accept it.  As no agreement has been reached,  the 
case has been passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Mrs P appears to have  accepted the adjudicators  findings about the RCF (loan 1) and 
Sunny has accepted that loans 10  20 shouldnt have  been given. It seems therefore that 
the other lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think that I need to make a finding  about 
those loans. 
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted 
loans 2  9. But I have kept the other lending in mind when thinking about the overall lending 
relationship between Sunny and Mrs P. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute Sunny had to assess Mrs Ps situation to check  if she 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  shed  borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to 
do this in a way which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have  
taken into account  a number of different things,  such as how much was being  lent, the size 
of the repayments  and Mrs Ps income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mrs P. These  factors include:
Mrs P having a low income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mrs P having a large number of loans and/or having these loans  over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs P coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs P.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mrs P could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mrs P was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ref: DRN89057473Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ps complaint.
So as our adjudicator  explained, Mrs P was given  a RCF for her first loan. The credit 
agreement for Mrs Ps RCF explained that this type of credit  was unsuitable for borrowing 
over long periods  to time.  However, after Mrs P settled her RCF at the end of December 
2014 she returned a little over two weeks later to Sunny, who then provided Mrs P with a 
series of instalment  loans.  
So I think the effect of Mrs P returning for a new instalment loan, so quickly after repaying  
her RCF had the same effect as unfairly allowing Mrs P to continue  to draw down on the 
running account credit in a way that was unsuitable. So, Sunny should  have realised  that it 
was unlikely Mrs P wouldve been  able to sustainably repay loans 2  5.
So for this reason, I think Sunny  was wrong to have provided loans 2  5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs P was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs P had taken out 5 instalment loans in two months  and had 
used her RCF for six months. In addition,  Mrs P had a number of loans overlapping, 
and loan 6 was taken out 2 days after loan 5 was given, and 3 weeks  after loans 3 
and 4 were repaid.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely  than not Mrs P was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Mrs Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Ps first instalment loan was for £200  and loan 6 was for £100. Although, loan 6 
was for a smaller amount, loan 5 was still outstanding meaning Mrs P actually owed 
Sunny £250. At that point Sunny ought  to have  known  that Mrs P was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet a continued 
ongoing need. 
Mrs P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 9, was 
for £100, was a little smaller than her first instalment loan. But there was no 
sustained and constant decrease in lending. For example loan 7 was for £250.  So 
some four months  after she started  taking  instalment loans and 11 months  after Miss 
Ps lending relationship started she was still indebted to Sunny. Mrs P had paid large  
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mrs P lost out when Sunny provided  loans 6 to 9 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period and;
Ref: DRN89057474the sheer number  of loans and the time spent in debt was likely to have had negative  
implications on Mrs Ps ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mrs Ps complaint about  loan 2 to loan 9. And Ive set out what  Sunny 
should do to put things  right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do for loans 10 - 20, in order to put things 
right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs P paid on loans 2  20
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mrs P credit file about loans 2 - 5
remove loans 6 to 20 from Mrs Ps credit file entirely, this is because  the period of 
time Mrs P owed Sunny money  means  that any information still recorded about these 
loans is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mrs P a certificate  showing how much tax it has taken  off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mrs Ps complaint.  
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mrs P as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 June  2020.
