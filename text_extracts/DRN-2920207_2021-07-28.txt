The complaint
Miss W is unhappy that NewDay Ltd increased the credit limit on her account when such a 
credit limit increase wasnt affordable for her.  
What happened
Miss W held a credit account with NewDay with a credit limit of £300. In February 2020, 
NewDay wrote to Miss W to advise that they were increasing her credit limit to £1,550 and 
that unless Miss W contacted NewDay to decline the credit limit increase, the new credit limit 
would be available to Miss W from 30 March 2020.
Miss W didnt contact NewDay and the credit limit on her account was increased to £1,550. 
Miss W subsequently got into difficulty with the payments due on her credit account, with no 
payments being made toward the account after April 2020, and the account was defaulted 
by NewDay in February 2021.
Miss W wasnt happy about what had happened, so she made a complaint. NewDay looked 
at Miss Ws complaint, but they felt that they had conducted checks into Miss Ws financial 
position at the time that the credit limit increase had been offered to her, and that there was 
nothing resulting from those checks that suggested that the credit limit increase wouldnt 
have been affordable for Miss W at that time. So, they didnt uphold Miss Ws complaint.
Miss W wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that NewDay should 
have paid greater attention to the historical management of Miss Ws account, which they 
felt demonstrated that Miss W had struggled to maintain the account with a £300 credit limit. 
Because of this, our investigator felt that NewDay hadnt conducted reasonable and 
proportionate customer focussed checks into Miss Ws financial position before theyd 
offered her the credit limit increase, and that if they had conducted such checks, it would 
have been apparent to NewDay that Miss W wouldnt have been able to afford the credit limit 
increase being offered. 
So, our investigator recommended that the complaint be upheld in Miss Ws favour, and that 
NewDay should reimburse all interest, fees, and charges accrued after the credit limit 
increase back to Miss Ws account and remove the default from Miss Ws credit file. Our 
investigator also recommended that NewDay should make a payment of £100 to Miss W to 
compensate her for the trouble and upset this matter had caused.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendations put forward by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate customer focussed checks to ascertain whether any 
credit, or credit limit increase, being offered to that customer is affordable for that customer 
at that time.
NewDay believe that they did that here. Before they offered the credit limit increase to Miss 
W, they reviewed the historical usage of Miss Ws account and obtained information from a 
credit reference agency to help them gain an understanding of Miss Ws wider financial 
position. And NewDay maintain that there was nothing resulting from these checks that 
suggested to them that Miss W might not be able to afford the credit limit increase that was 
being offered to her.
However, having reviewed all the information available to me on this complaint, I find it 
difficult not to conclude that NewDays assessment of Miss Ws financial position at that time 
wasnt customer focussed and didnt pay enough attention to the difficulties in managing her 
account with a £300 credit limit that Miss W had previously demonstrated. 
One reason I say this is because NewDay offered the credit limit increase to Miss W in 
February 2020. However, In October 2019, Miss W exceeded the credit limit on her account 
and incurred an over limit fee because of this. Furthermore, in January 2020, Miss W used 
the credit account for cash withdrawals, which can be an indicator that a person is 
experiencing financial difficulty. 
These events followed a period shortly after the credit account was opened where Miss W 
struggled to stay within the £300 credit limit on her account and incurred multiple over limit 
fees and used her card for cash withdrawals close to the credit limit. And, while Miss W was 
able to bring her account back within contractual terms over a year before the credit limit 
was offered, I feel that these historical issues further demonstrate that Miss Ws 
circumstances at those times were such that any credit limit increase offered while Miss Ws 
circumstances remained the same might not be affordable for.
As such, I feel that NewDay should have contacted Miss W directly to update their 
understanding of her personal circumstances before offering a credit limit increase to her. 
And this is especially the case given that the credit limit increase that NewDay offered to 
Miss W was an increase of over five times Miss Ws previous credit limit of £300.
NewDay have stated that the obtained information from a credit reference agency which 
confirmed to them that Miss W could afford the credit limit being offered. But the 
responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of this information resides with NewDay, and it 
remains my position that, given Miss Ws previous struggles with her account, NewDay 
should have contacted Miss W themselves to confirm Miss Ws financial position before 
offering any further credit, and that if they had, NewDay should, in all likelihood, have 
reached the conclusion that the credit limit being offered to Miss W might be unaffordable for 
her, such that a credit limit increase of that size shouldnt have been offered.
I realise that this might not be the outcome that NewDay were wanting here, but it follows 
from the above that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss Ws favour and instructing 
NewDay to undertake corrective action accordingly. I hope that NewDay can understand, 
given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Ws account all interest, charges, and fees accrued or 
incurred on balances over £300 following the credit limit increase.If these reimbursements result in the account having a credit balance in Miss Ws favour, 
NewDay must pay this balance to Miss W along with 8% interest  calculated from the date 
that Miss W made each overpayment until the date its reimbursed to her.
NewDay must also remove all adverse information relating to Miss Ws account following the 
credit limit increase from Miss Ws credit file.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £100 to Miss W to compensate her for any 
distress or inconvenience this matter might have caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 August 2021.
