K821x#15complaint
Mr F has complained about loans  granted to him by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender).  Mr F says he could not afford to repay these 
loans and that Sunny ought to have known this and known that he would have to borrow 
further to meet his repayments.
background
Sunny agreed  ten loans for Mr F from June 2014  to October 2016. The first loan was an 
open-ended credit facility  with a £1,000 limit. The remaining nine loans were short term 
loans from £100  to £1,200  to be repaid over 11 or 14 month  terms. The below table sets out 
some of the information  Sunny has provided  about these loans.

* This was an open-ended credit facility with a £1,000  limit
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Fs complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund some 
of the interest  and charges he paid for his first loan, and all of the interest  and charges on 
loans 2 to 10. 
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest  and charges on 
loans 6 to 10 because,  it said,  that it is possible that from this point [Mr F] may have started 
to become reliant on the credit  and as a result  the lending to him may not have been 
sustainable.
Mr F didnt  accept this offer and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman,  for 
review and final decision. If Mr F accepts my decision, it will be legally binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Mr F took out his loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  said that for 
Ref: DRN33881502all loans Sunny  needed  to check that Mr F could afford to meet  his repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This meant Mr F being  able to meet his repayments  out of his normal 
income without having  to go without or borrow further. Sunny was also required to monitor  
Mr Fs repayment  record and take appropriate  action  if there  were  signs  of potential  
repayment difficulties.
The regulations werent prescriptive  about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order  
to reasonably assess whether or not Mr F would be able to meet  his repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks  needed  to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer  in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult  to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
-the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
-the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer  has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny said that it asked  Mr F for information about  his income  and expenses  each time he 
applied for credit, though  it hasnt  recorded an expenditure figure from the time of Mr Fs first 
loan application.  The lender says Mr Fs monthly income varied  from £1,525 to £1,575 and 
his monthly expenses from £425 to £725,  including variable credit commitment repayments  
of £50 to £250.  These figures  might  suggest that the loans in question were affordable for 
Mr F, given  the amount  he needed  to repay each month. 
Sunny also said that it checked Mr Fs credit record through a third-party credit reference 
agency and has provided some  of the information  it obtained in this way. It says that it 
compared what Mr F said he repaid  each  month  on existing credit  commitments and what it 
could see from the credit file, taking  the higher figure  where there was a discrepancy.  Ive 
looked through this information  and it seems to show  that when Mr F first applied  to Sunny 
for credit he had over £15,700 of unsecured lending and was repaying £566 each month to 
meet these commitments. He also had taken  out £300 of other short  term credit  the month 
before. I think its fair to say that Mr Fs finances were somewhat pressured  at this time but, 
given this was his first loan from Sunny,  on balance  I dont think  the lender was irresponsible 
to have agreed to it.
However, Sunny needed to monitor how Mr F was using this facility. The credit agreement  
shows an example  repayment  schedule with five repayments of £270 should  Mr F take out 
his full limit of £1,000, which he did. The below table shows his drawdown  history (with 
figures rounded  to the nearest pound).

Ref: DRN33881503Our adjudicator said that Sunny should  not have agreed Mr Fs fourth  drawdown  because at 
this stage hed been making repayments  and borrowing  again  up to his limit and it was likely 
that he had problems managing his money.  I agree  with this. This was the third time Mr F 
had taken out an exact amount to bring his account  back up to its limit having made a 
repayment, this time on the same day. I can see from Mr Fs credit file that in October 2014 
he was borrowing from several  short term lenders  and had at least three other  short term 
loans outstanding. He was also up to his limit on four credit  cards and had taken out cash 
advances across them all. At this point Sunny ought  to have realised that Mr F wasnt likely 
to be able to meet his repayments  for this facility  in a sustainable manner and so shouldnt 
have agreed further credit  for him.
Mr F took out a second loan shortly after he took his last drawdown  on his credit  facility. 
Although this was for the relatively low amount of £100, given his borrowing history and that 
Mr F would be committed to repaying this loan over most of a year, I think Sunny  ought to 
have looked further into his circumstances  before  agreeing  to it. Had it done so, I think  it 
would have seen  that Mr F was continuing to borrow from several other  short term and high 
cost lenders and, as a responsible lender,  would  not have agreed  credit for him. 
Mr Fs circumstances  didnt improve.  He took out a £900 loan from Sunny almost  as soon as 
he paid off his running account credit. And he took out his largest loan (loan 6 in the loan 
table) the day he repaid two previous ones. I agree with Sunny that when Mr F asked for his 
sixth loan it should not have agreed  to it, given the lending history. As Sunny said when 
making its offer, it understands that short term loans are intended  for temporary  cash  flow 
problems. I think Mr F lost out when Sunny agreed loan 6 and went  on to agree later loans 
because these had the effect  of prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short  term use over an extended  period of time. And this was 
likely to be seen negatively by other  lenders and potentially kept Mr F in the market for high 
cost loans. 1 10/08/2014 £350

Ref: DRN33881504what Sunny should  do to put things right
Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed  further credit for Mr F from and including  the fourth 
drawdown on his credit facility on 31 October  2014. In order  to put things right for Mr F, 
Sunny should
-refund all interest  and charges Mr F paid on capital drawn down through his credit  
facility from and including the 31 October 2014;  and
-refund all interest  and charges he paid on loans 2 to 10; and
-pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
-remove any adverse information about the credit  facility and loans 2 to 5 from Mr Fs 
credit file.
-remove all information about loans 6 to 10 from Mr Fs credit file as any information 
recorded about these loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I am upholding Mr Fs complaint about  Elevate Credit International 
Limited trading  as Sunny and direct it to put things right for him as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020.
