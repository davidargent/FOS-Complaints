K821x#15complaint
Ms M complains that Firmbarn Limited (trading as Cash Converters) irresponsibly lent to her
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2019 because I thought that 
fewer loans should be upheld. I attach the detailed background  and my provisional findings  
at the end of this decision, and it forms part of my final decision.
I gave both parties the opportunity to provide further comments  and evidence  before 
considering my final decision.
Ms M responded to say she had nothing further to add. Cash Converters disagreed  with my 
provisional decision. It said it didnt think its loans  negatively impacted Ms M ability to 
access mainstream credit and that it never  accessed or used her credit file at any point. And 
so the loans werent recorded on her credit  file.
 
my findings
Ive again reconsidered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken into account Cash Converters point that it never searched Ms Ms credit file and I 
accept this. At the time it lent it wasnt required to, so I dont think that on its own means that 
it did something wrong. 
However, I think the information it held at the time,  in particular Ms Ms bank statement 
provided sufficient information  that ought  to have made it aware she couldnt afford loans 3 
to 7. From her bank  statements and her declaration, Cash Converters ought to have been 
aware that she was in three debt management plans and her monthly living  costs  including  
regular and short term credit commitments outweighed her income. And in those 
circumstances Cash Converters ought  to have been aware that 
Ms M couldnt afford  the loan repayments.
Cash Converters has also said its loans didnt affect  Ms Ms ability to access mainstream 
credit. I dont agree with this and I think thats  borne out in the fact that Ms Ms loan amounts 
from loan 5 onwards  either stayed the same or increased. I think by loan 7, Cash Converters 
should have been aware that Ms M was dependent on these loans and she wasnt using  the 
loans for their intended purpose of a short term cash flow problem.  The repeated lending 
was unsustainable  for Ms M.
Having carefully considered Cash  Converters points,  my decision remains unchanged and 
Cash Converters needs to put things  right.
putting things right  what Cash  Converters  needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Ms M paid on loans 3 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement.
Cash Converters says its loans didnt reflect on Ms Ms credit  file so I expect that there will 
Ref: DRN67752782be no adverse information  about  loans 3 to 7. And that loan 7 onwards wouldnt reflect Ms 
Ms credit file also.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash Converters to take off tax from this interest.  
Cash Converters must  give Ms M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  here and in my provisional  decision, I partially uphold Ms Ms 
complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.

Our adjudicator upheld Ms Ms complaint and thought that none of the loans should have 
been given. Cash Converters  disagreed  and the complaint  was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  
in the circumstances  of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach to complaints about  
short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on 
our website.
Cash Converters needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure
Ms M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into account  a 
number of different things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be reasonable and proportionate.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Cash Converters was required  to establish whether  Ms M could  sustainably repay  her loans
 not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what  this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
Ref: DRN67752784The adjudicator upheld Ms Ms complaint from loan 1 onwards because  he thought
Cash Converters didnt react to the information it had about  Ms Ms financial  circumstances. And 
Cash Converters ought to have been aware  that Ms M couldnt afford any of the loans.
Before Cash Converters lent Ms M any of the loans, it searched her credit file. Ive seen 
evidence to show that Cash Converters also checked Ms Ms bank statements.
Cash Converters has provided copies of the bank statements it collected before  it lent to Ms M. 
Ms M has also provided copies of her bank statements from the time of these  loans.
Ive reviewed both sets of bank statements to try to build  a clearer  picture  of her circumstances 
at the time.  Ive placed particular weight on the set of bank statements  Cash Converters had as 
this is the information it held at the time of lending  because this is the information it wouldve 
used to make its lending  decisions. From what  I can see, Ms M was in about  three debt 
management plans. Shed  declared that she was paying around £19 per month into these plans. 
And from what I can see on the bank statements, the actual amounts Ms M was paying towards 
these plans were similar to what she declared.
I can see that around the time of loan 1, Ms M had been borrowing from other short term lender 
from the information available,  but she didnt have any payments outstanding to any other short 
term lenders when Cash Converters lent to her.
The information on Ms Ms bank statement also suggests that Ms M would be left with around 
£277, after deducting her living costs and the cost of repaying loan 1. Given  what  Cash 
Converters could see, I think it was reasonable for it to have  lent in the circumstances.
By the time of loan 2, the bank  statements  show that Ms M would have been left with around
£115 of disposable  income after repaying the loan. I also think it was reasonable for Cash 
Converters to lend in the situation. Because based on what it saw, it believed Ms M could 
afford the repayments she was committed  to making.
So I dont think Cash Converters  was wrong  to lend Ms M loans  1 and 2.
However, at the time of loan 3, Ms Ms living expenses including things like rent, water, phone  
and loan repayments showed  that shed be left with around £257.  I can see that the loan 
repayment for loan 3 was around £232  and in the circumstances, Ms M couldnt afford  to 
sustainably repay this loan. And Cash Converters  shouldnt have lent to her.
Ms M was in a similar position at the time of the subsequent loans which were for increasing 
amounts. Ms M continued to pay into three payment plans and her living costs didnt  decrease 
and so in my opinion she wasnt in a position to sustainably repay the loans. I think this was likely 
the reason she needed  to borrow further.
So I dont think Cash Converters  should have  lent Ms M loans 3 to 6.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Cash Converters lending history with Ms M, with a 
view to seeing  if there was a point at which  Cash Converters should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Cash Converters should  have 
realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
at this point Cash Converters ought to have realised  Ms M was not managing to repay  her 
loans sustainably.  Ms M had been indebted  to Cash  Converters  for around 5 months 
without any breaks. In that time she was either borrowing or repaying  a loan. So Cash 
Converters ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Ms M was having to borrow 
Ref: DRN67752785further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms 
Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms Ms first loan was for £60 and loan 7 was for £210. Ms Ms loan amounts were  
generally either  increasing or taking new loans for similar sums. So at this point Cash 
Converters ought to have  known that Ms M was unlikely borrowing to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need.
From loan 7 onwards  Ms M was provided with a new loan usually on the day she settled a 
previous one. This was the case for most of the loans from loan 7 onwards with the 
exception of loan 11, which  was lent a day after loan 10 was repaid.
Ms M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Cash Converters. Loan 11 
was taken out nine months  after Ms Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Cash Converters  over an 
extended period.
I think  that Ms M lost out because  Cash Converters  continued to provide  credit from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging  Ms Ms indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Ms M borrowed  was likely to have had negative  implications 
on her ability  to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the market for these  high- 
cost loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans  7 to 11 and Cash Converters should  put 
things right.
