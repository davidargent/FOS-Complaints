K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains that National Westminster Bank  Plc didnt do enough  to protect  his account 
when someone  attempted fraud  against  him. Mr W also complains about  the service  he 
received from NatWest. 
background
In March 2018 Mr W told NatWest that hed been the victim of an attempted  fraud on his 
accounts. NatWest cancelled the cards  Mr W had for his accounts and disabled his online 
banking facility. NatWest  also advised Mr W to use software to check  his computer. Mr W 
was told his accounts would be secured but NatWest failed to follow up on its promise.  
No funds were subsequently fraudulently taken  from Mr Ws account.  
Mr W complained  to NatWest as he didnt feel itd done  enough  to protect  his account. 
NatWest responded  and apologised for failing to secure his account in line with what hed 
been told. NatWest  paid Mr W £100 for the trouble  and upset caused and £16.20  for call 
costs. As Mr W felt the settlement was too low he referred his complaint to this service. 
An adjudicator looked at whatd happened but didnt ask NatWest to increase its offer or do 
anything else as they thought the complaint had been dealt with fairly. Mr W remains 
unhappy and has asked for his complaint to be appealed so its been passed  to me to make 
a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
In this case, all parties broadly agree about whats  happened. Mr W notified NatWest  that 
thered been an attempted  fraud on his accounts. Despite NatWest saying it would take 
steps to secure  the accounts, it didnt.  Mr W wasnt subsequently a victim of fraud and hasnt 
lost money as a result  of NatWests error but feels the compensation hes received doesnt 
reflect whats happened. 
As all parties agree on the circumstances here Ive focused on whether NatWests  existing  
offer is fair in the circumstances  of Mr Ws complaint.  
When Mr W told NatWest  about whatd happened it did take steps to protect his accounts.  
Mr Ws cards were cancelled and his online banking facility was disabled. I agree that 
NatWest shouldve secured both of Mr Ws accounts  as promised and can see it was a 
stressful time for him. 
But NatWest  has paid Mr W £100 for the way it handled the situation and covered his call 
costs. And whilst I appreciate Mr W feels thats  too low, Im satisfied its fair. I know  Mr W 
had to visit a branch  initially which  was inconvenient  but that was because  he didnt correctly 
answer the security  questions when he called. I can also see Mr Ws upset that his complaint 
wasnt correctly logged  but NatWest was able to respond to his concerns on 5 April 2018 so 
Ive not found  the investigation was unreasonably  delayed. 
Ref: DRN30224882When we look at compensation we focus on the impact the error has had on the consumer. 
And in this case, Im satisfied the £100 NatWest  has already paid fairly reflects the impact  of 
what happened on Mr W. Whilst I agree things couldve been handled better  the situation 
was resolved reasonably quickly and NatWests paid Mr W for the costs he incurred. 
As Im satisfied NatWests  payment  of £100 was fair in all the circumstances Im not telling it 
to take any further  action  to resolve  this complaint.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or reject my decision 
before 1 March  2019.
