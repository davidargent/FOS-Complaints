K821x#15complaint
Mr Z is unhappy  with the compensation  Canada  Square Operations Limited (Canada 
Square) offered to settle his complaint about a mis-sold  payment  protection insurance (PPI) 
policy.
background
Mr Z took out a loan with Canada Square in January 2005 and at the same time purchased a 
PPI policy. The cost of the policy was added  to the amount  Mr Z borrowed for his loan.
When Mr Z complained the PPI was mis-sold Canada  Square upheld his complaint and 
offered some compensation. It said Mr Z had on settlement of his loan received a partial 
rebate for the policy premium and this had been  taken into account in working out the 
compensation.
Mr Z wasnt happy with the offer as he said he never received  the rebate and so should get 
back the full amount of the PPI cost that was added to his loan and that he paid on 
settlement. As Canada  Square did not agree  he brought  his complaint to this service.  
Having considered all the fact presented in this matter I issued a provisional decision in 
March 2020 that set out my findings.  A copy of that provisional decision is attached  to, and 
forms part of, this final decision. 
I indicated in my provisional decision why I was intending to uphold Mr Zs complaint. Both 
parties have responded to that decision. 
Mr Z provided no additional evidence and accepted my findings. 
Canada Square  indicated it did not accept  my findings and provided additional comment on, 
and explanation of, the figures shown in its records.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I set out in detail  in my provisional decision the main figures to be considered in determining  
how much  Mr Z actually  paid for the PPI once  he had settled the loan. The issue  to be 
decided was whether Mr Z paid for the full cost of the PPI premium,  or if an adjustment  for a 
PPI rebate  was made on early settlement of the loan, so he paid less than the full premium 
charged.
Mr Z borrowed a total of £17,706.15 including the PPI premium of £2,706.15, interest was 
paid on the total borrowed and the loan was to be repaid over 60 months.  When  Mr Z 
wanted to settle  his loan early in October 2005,  Canada Squares records indicate  two 
figures were  given to him. One of these was to settle with a partial  PPI rebate removed and 
the other was to settle with no adjustment  for the PPI rebate.
As I indicated in my provisional decision Mr Z had spoken to Canada Square  a little time 
before he obtained the settlement figures and these  records suggest he was thinking  about 
Ref: DRN00041432keeping the PPI running. No records or evidence  has been provided to show  when the PPI 
was actually cancelled  or if it ran for the full 60 months it was bought to cover.
In its response to my provisional decision Canada Square hasnt provided any evidence  to 
show whether the PPI was cancelled or made  any reference to this. Nor has it made  any 
comment on the fact Mr Z was given two redemption figures  in advance of settlement.  It has 
only referred to the redemption figure  of £13,766.37 being the settlement quoted in 
MEMOS. It makes no reference  as to why Mr Z was, from its own contact log, quoted that 
figure and also the figure without the rebate  of £15,727.22.
On settlement Mr Z first paid £10,000.00 and three days later the final transaction  shown on 
the records, to produce a zero balance, is the figure  of £7,705.41, although the outstanding  
balance on the account was shown  as £5,694.95. 
Canada Square  has provided detailed figures  on the interpretation of what  was included in 
the amount of £7,705.41,  shown as the PAYOFF in the transactions.  It has explained that 
this figure  was not the total amount of any settlement figure  but was made up of a number of 
final transactions that included both credit and debit amounts.
It says the balance of £5,694.95 plus interest of £32.27 to the actual date of settlement, the 
PPI rebate  figure  of £1,960.85, and another interest  adjustment of £17.34 were all added 
together to give the figure of £7.705.41.  Canada  Square says if no rebate had occurred then 
there would be no element for this within  the PAYOFF figure.
 
I understand the explanation of how the figure of £7,705.41 has been achieved  but this still 
doesnt show that Mr Z did not pay £5,727.32  on settlement.  In January 2020 Canada  
Square told us that Mr A would have paid the £5,727.22 on settlement, that was the 
£7,705.41 less the rebate amount with minor adjustments for interest.  
As I indicated in my provisional decision,  I cannot  find any evidence to show  that Mr Z only 
paid £3,766.37 on final settlement, which would mean the loan balance was adjusted on 
settlement by the rebate figure. Whilst I accept a rebate figure was calculated,  and in shown 
within various figures relating to the loan, I still have seen nothing to show it was applied  to 
adjust any amount Mr Z paid on settlement. 
Sometimes rebates  for PPI can be paid direct to a consumer rather than adjusting a 
settlement amount, or this can happen if the consumer  has already paid the loan balance 
before the rebate  is applied and there  is a resulting credit balance that need refunding. But 
here I have  seen nothing to show  any credit  balance remained on the account  that was 
refunded if this situation had arisen. And both Mr Z and Canada Square have said this did 
not happen and also that there was no direct payment of the rebate to Mr Z.
I have looked  in detail at the explanations provided by Canada  Square about the figures 
from the records. But nothing has clearly shown that Mr Z only paid £13,766.37  on 
settlement, that is the balance of £15,727.32 in total, less the PPI rebate. When he asked for 
a settlement figure  he was quoted both amounts. So, in this particular case  it is quite 
possible he paid the higher amount, especially having asked Canada Square before about  
keeping the PPI running.
It follows I have seen  nothing to change the findings  in my provisional decision and based on 
what I have seen I think Mr Z most  likely paid the full costs of the PPI policy on settlement of 
his loan. 
Ref: DRN00041433Therefore Canada Square should refund Mr Z the further £1,960.85 plus 8% simple interest 
on that figure, from 10 October 2005  (the date shown as final settlement of the loan)  to the 
date Canada Square pays the compensation to Mr Z. 
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  set out above and also in my provisional decision, a copy  of which is 
attached to and forms part of this final decision, I am upholding Mr Zs complaint.  
Canada Square  Operations Limited should pay the additional refund and compensatory 
interest to Mr Z as I have  indicated above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 June 2020.

complaint
Mr Zs complaint is about the amount of compensation Canada Square Operations  Limited  (Canada 
Square) has offered for a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out alongside  a 
loan. 
background 
In January 2005 Mr Z took out a loan with Canada  Square and at the same time bought a PPI policy. 
Mr Z has since complained the PPI was mis-sold. Canada Square has agreed to uphold the complaint 
and offered to pay compensation  to Mr Z.
Canada Square  offered  £1,643.26 in compensation to settle the complaint. Mr Z wasnt happy with 
this as the offer sent to him indicated he had already received a rebate for the PPI of £1,960.85. 
Canada Square  said the rebate had been a partial refund applied on settlement as the loan was 
settled early.
Mr Z said he never received  any rebate and had paid the full amount of the premium so he wanted 
the whole amount  refunded.  
He brought his complaint to this service  and our adjudicator said they thought what Canada  Square 
had paid in compensation was most likely fair. Mr Z still disagreed and asked  for an ombudsman to 
look at his complaint.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
As Canada  Square has agreed the PPI was mis-sold I am not in this decision considering how the 
policy came  to be sold to Mr Z. I am looking at if the compensation  offered by Canada Square is fair.
The main issue in this complaint is whether Canada Square gave Mr Z a rebate of the PPI premium 
when he settled his loan early.
Canada Square  has provided a copy of the loan agreement. This shows the loan amount Mr Z wanted 
to borrow for his own use was £15,000 and the PPI premium of £2,706.15 was added to that. This 
made a total loan of £17,706.15 which  was to be repaid  over 60 months at monthly  payments of 
£348.34. If the loan had run to term then Mr Z would  have repaid a total of around £20,900 for 
everything he had borrowed  and also to pay interest on those  borrowings.
On 4 October 2005 Mr Z asked Canada Square for a redemption figure  to repay  the loan early. The 
records provided of the contact  log events and message reports (The Log) suggest  that he was 
given two figures for redemption, both based on the loan ending on 14 October 2005. One redemption 
amount was for £13,766.37 which is stated as inc rebate and the other  was £15,727.22  and stated 
as exc rebate. The difference is £1,960.85 which is said by Canada Square to be the rebate for the 
PPI on early settlement.  
It is unusual for two redemption figures to be provided  in this way as normally the figure given to a 
consumer would be the amount to be paid by them once any rebate is removed from the balance. But 
from this it seems Mr Z needed  to pay £13,766.37 if the rebate was taken off the amount he owed.
Ref: DRN00041435A rebate  for PPI is often paid on early settlement of a loan and cancellation  of the policy. So some 
money paid for the premium is due back as the policy  didnt cover the full period that it was bought to 
cover.
I have also noted that in The Log record provided  it shows that in June 2005 Mr Z spoke to Canada  
Square and reference is made to Cust thinking of retaining PPI, informed of the cost . It is unclear 
what this relates to exactly and may have been another product. But it perhaps suggests that when 
Mr Z called for the redemption figures in October 2005 he may possibly have been considering  
keeping the PPI active  for some reason.  So he was given  two amounts, one with and one without a 
rebate applied for the PPI. And I have not actually seen  anything to confirm cancellation  of the PPI 
policy sold with the loan.
Looking at the loan account transactions and the amounts shown  on settlement,  this indicates  two 
payments were made to the account. One for £10,000 was made  on the 7 October 2005 and the 
other for £7,705.41 on 10 October 2005. This would be a total of £17,705.41  in total to settle the 
balance of the loan.
The business  has told us that the £7,705.41 minus the rebate of £1,960.85 would have been the 
amount paid by Mr Z to settle the loan.  So removing the £1,960.85 for the PPI rebate from this 
payment amount would leave £5,798.56 and the business has indicated  to this service that Mr Z paid 
this on settlement.
This suggests that in October 2005 Mr Z paid a total of £15,798.56 to clear the balance on the loan. 
This figure  is very similar  to the amount quoted by telephone as the redemption figure  excluding the 
PPI rebate. This amount  paid on settlement was in addition to the eight monthly  payments Mr Z had 
paid totalling £2,786.72. So in total over the course of the loan it seems most likely Mr Z paid around 
£18,585.28 for his loan.  
The account  information shows a total of £807.79 was paid in interest whilst the loan was running. As 
the total he borrowed was £17,706.15, this amount added to the interest would  be £18,513.94. This is 
£71.34 less than what I think Mr Z actually paid, as Ive indicated above and it is quite possible this is 
some sort of interest adjustment amount.  
Whilst I have  seen the screen shot that states a Rebate  Paid  of £1,960.85, it seems this is shown  as 
part of an amount of £7,673.14 which also includes  a payment of principal  of £5,694.95, the principal 
which Canada Square has said was paid by Mr Z. 
Having looked closely at all the figures and information provided by both parties  I cannot  find anything 
to indicate that on settlement, after payment of the first £10,000, Mr Z paid £3,766.37 as part of the 
£7.705.41 being the final entry on the account.  
I cannot see from the records and information provided  that £1,960.85 reduced the outstanding  
balance which was £5,694.95 after Mr Z had paid the first £10,000. It seems Mr Z paid £10,000 and 
then a further £5,694.95  on settlement. This would  mean he did not benefit from a rebate and so paid 
the full costs of the PPI. 
I am not at present persuaded that Mr Z did receive  a rebate for the PPI deducted from the loan 
settlement figure,  as stated  by Canada  Square.  If this had happened Mr Z should only have paid 
£13,766.37 on settlement  and the figures presented at present do not show that this was the case.  
This amount  is only actually referred to in the telephone records,  where both with and without  the 
rebate figures seem to have been provided. 
I have also noted that Canada Square and Mr Z both say the rebate amount was not paid directly  to 
Mr Z. 
Without persuasive evidence and figures to show differently, I am intending to find that Mr Z paid the 
full costs of the PPI on settlement of his loan and never actually  had any rebate  applied. Therefore, 
Ref: DRN00041436Canada Square  still owes him a further £1,960.85 plus 8% simple interest on that amount  from the 10 
October 2005 (the date of settlement of the loan) to the date Canada Square  pays the final 
compensation. 
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above, but subject to the responses of both parties, Im intending to tell 
Canada Square  Operations Limited to pay the additional amount of the premium of £1,960.85 plus 
8% simple interest on this amount to the date of final settlement.
This is all subject to any further information that is provided by either party by the date indicted  at the 
start of this decision.
