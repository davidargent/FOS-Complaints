K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about delays in receiving  two payments he sent via TransferWise Ltd.
background
On 11 December 2018 Mr M set up two transfers  using TransferWise. Mr M was sending 
funds from abroad so needed  to convert  them to Sterling (GBP) from Swiss Francs  (CHF). 
One transfer was for 22,000 CHF and the other  was for 2,000  CHF.  
On 12 December 2018 TransferWise  confirmed it had received Mr Ms funds to transfer onto 
his UK account. 
Mr M says he didnt  receive his money so contacted TrasnferWise on 14 December 2018.  
TransferWise told Mr M that there was a delay with his bank in the UK. But Mr M says that 
when he spoke to his bank he wasnt told about  any problems with his transfers. 
On 19 December 2018 TransferWise  asked Mr M to confirm the purpose of the transfer and 
he said he was sending  money hed earned back to the UK. 
On 24 December 2018 the larger of the two payments was received in Mr Ms bank account. 
The second  payment was received on 8 January  2019, nearly  a month  after it was sent. 
Mr M complained but TransferWise didnt agree it had caused the delay. TransferWise said 
the delay was caused by Mr Ms bank and that it had made reasonable efforts to try and 
speed things up. TransferWise offered  to send two free payments  of up to Â£2,000  as a 
gesture of goodwill. 
Mr M referred his complaint to this service  and an investigator looked  at it. They  didnt find 
any evidence that the delay was caused by TransferWise and were satisfied it had sent the 
payments to Mr Ms bank  on 12 December  2018. The investigator  said theyd seen evidence 
of the information requested by Mr Ms bank  and the times it had taken TransferWise  to 
respond. The investigator didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint and he asked to appeal so its 
been passed to me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Like the investigator, I havent found any evidence of a delay by TransferWise.  Im sorry to 
disappoint Mr M but from what Ive seen,  TransferWise made his payments on 
12 December 2018 and reacted quickly when his bank contacted it for information. 
Mr Ms bank contacted TransferWise  for information  on 18 December 2018 and it responded 
with the information requested the following  day. I know Mr M feels  TrasnferWise was the 
party requesting information about  his payments but the evidence Ive seen doesnt  support 
that. 
Ref: DRN25188132The second  payment wasnt received into Mr Ms account until 8 January 2019. 
TransferWise has sent in copies of its emails to Mr Ms bank requesting updates  on the 
second payment.  I can see that throughout this time the funds were  not held with 
TransferWise and had already been  transferred to Mr Ms bank. Aside from responding to 
information requests  and asking for updates on the status of the payments there was little 
TransferWise could  do. I havent found  any evidence to show  TransferWise  delayed his 
payments. 
In his response to the investigator  Mr M said TransferWise  shouldve done more  to keep him 
informed of the situation. But I think it provided  updates and information as best it could. 
TransferWise no longer had Mr Ms money so the information it could give him was limited.  
TransferWise offered Mr M two free transfers  as a gesture of goodwill. I leave it to Mr M to 
decide whether  he wants  to take up that offer.  But as I havent found  any evidence  of a delay 
or poor service by TransferWise Im not telling it to take any further action to resolve this 
complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 June  2019.
