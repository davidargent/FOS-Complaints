The complaint
Mrs P complains that a hire purchase agreement, under which a car was supplied to her, 
was mis-sold to her by RCI Financial Services Limited, trading as Nissan Finance. 
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs P under a hire purchase agreement with Nissan Finance that 
she signed in August 2014. She returned that car when the agreement ended and a new car 
was supplied to her under another hire purchase agreement with Nissan Finance that she 
signed in September 2017. Mrs P returned that car when the agreement ended and a new 
car was supplied to her under another hire purchase agreement with Nissan Finance that 
she electronically signed in March 2021. 
Mrs P complained to Nissan Finance in June 2022 that the August 2014 and September 
2017 agreements were mis-sold to her. She said that she wasnt aware that the dealer 
wasnt acting in her best interests by ensuring that she was taking out the most appropriate 
finance for her needs and that shes overpaid interest and lost out financially. Shes also 
made a complaint about the car that was supplied to her under the March 2021 agreement 
but that complaint has been dealt with separately.
Nissan Finance said that it was unable to uphold her claim that she was mis-sold the August 
2014 or September 2017 agreement as she was provided with pre-contract credit 
information and signed both agreements to confirm that she was satisfied and understood 
the terms and conditions, including the monthly rentals, the total price and the APR. It also 
said that she was sent a welcome letter confirming the first monthly rental payment date and 
enclosing a frequently asked questions page which included information about APRs and 
total interest charges. It said that she was also sent annual account statements which 
reiterated the amount of credit, APR, outstanding balance and her rights to early settle or 
terminate the agreement.
Mrs P wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service in October 2022. She 
says that she believes that she was mis-sold the finance by Nissan Finance as she didnt 
know that she was paying interest on the balloon payment or that it should have advised her 
about alternative options. 
Our investigator said that there were two separate complaints: a complaint about the August 
2014 agreement which would be dealt with separately and this complaint about the 
September 2017 agreement. He said that the September 2017 agreement clearly set out the 
costs associated with it, including how much interest was applied and what it was applied to. 
Mrs P has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that she 
didnt know that there were other options available, that Nissan Finance was paying 
commission to the dealer or that it had done anything wrong. 
Mrs Ps complaint about the August 2014 agreement is being dealt with separately and in 
this decision Im only dealing with her complaint about the September 2017 agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs P had entered into a hire purchase agreement in August 2014 for a new car to 
be supplied to her - she returned that car when the agreement ended in September 
2017 and a new car was supplied to her under another hire purchase agreement with 
Nissan Finance;
the dealers September 2017 invoice shows that the price of that car was £20,893 
from which a total grant/deposit contribution of £2,300, an advance payment of 
£1,000 and a part-exchange allowance of £2,073.52 were deducted so the amount 
due was £15,519.48;
Mrs P signed the hire purchase agreement in September 2017 which showed that 
the cash price of the car was £20,893, the advance payments totalled £5,373.52 and 
the amount of credit was £15,519.48, and she agreed to make 48 monthly payments 
of £242.56 and a final payment of £5,582.48;
she also signed a customer written summary in which she confirmed that shed 
received the pre-contract credit information  it also said: I confirm I have been 
provided with an oral explanation of the matters outlined above and have received 
this Summary. I have been given sufficient time to read the information provided and 
the opportunity to ask questions. I confirm that the credit product is suitable for my 
requirements, that it is affordable relative to my financial means and that I am not 
aware of any likely changes to my circumstances that might affect my ability to make 
the repayments;
the pre-contract credit information showed the financial information relating to the 
hire purchase agreement including the interest rate of 3.99% and the total amount 
payable by Mrs P;
the hire purchase agreement also showed that the interest rate was 3.99% and that 
the interest charges were £1,706.37;
Mrs P agreed in September 2017 to receive credit of £15,519.48 from Nissan 
Finance and she agreed to repay that amount to it, with interest charges of 
£1,706.37, by 48 monthly payments of £242.56 and a final payment of £5,582.48;
Nissan Finance has provided an account statement which shows that Mrs P made 
the monthly payments under the agreement and she then returned that car to Nissan 
Finance and entered into another hire purchase agreement with it for it to supply a 
car to her;
I consider that the pre-contract credit information and the hire purchase agreement 
contained the information that Nissan Finance was required to provide to Mrs P and 
that they clearly set out the amounts that were due from, and payable by, her;
Nissan Finance is not a financial adviser and Im not persuaded that it was required 
to provide Mrs P with any information about other financing options that might be 
available to her or that it was required to provide her with any other information; 
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs P has paid to 
Nissan Finance more than she should have done for the car or that shes paid more 
interest than she should have;Mrs P says that the true value of the car that she handed back wasnt considered and 
she ended up with a car with a lower specification but an increased monthly 
payment;
Mrs P had the option when each of the hire purchase agreements ended to return the 
car to Nissan Finance and not make the final payment  the cars belonged to Nissan 
Finance so the value of the car that she returned wouldnt have affected the amount 
that was payable under the hire purchase agreement that was ending or the hire 
purchase agreement under which the next car was being supplied to her;
Mrs P agreed the price of each of the cars with the dealer and agreed the payment 
arrangements with Nissan Finance  if they werent acceptable to her I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect her not to have entered into the hire purchase 
agreement for that car to be supplied to her;
Mrs P said, in response to our investigators recommendations, that she didnt know 
that Nissan Finance was paying a commission to the dealer  but there was no 
reference in Mrs Ps complaint letter to Nissan Finance or in her complaint form to 
any commission that it paid to the dealer so I dont consider that a complaint about 
any commission forms part of this complaint;
if Mrs P wants to complain that she didnt know that that Nissan Finance was paying 
a commission to the dealer, she should first complain about that to Nissan Finance 
and then, if shes not satisfied with its response, she may be able to make a separate 
complaint to this service;
although I make no finding on this point, the customer written summary that was 
signed by Mrs P in September 2017 says: The Dealer is independent from us and 
we may pay the Dealer commission if you enter into this agreement;
I sympathise with Mrs P for the concerns that shes described but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that Nissan Finance mis-sold the September 
2017 agreement to her or that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with her relating 
to that agreement; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Nissan Finance to refund to her any of the money that shes paid under the 
September 2017 agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 July 2023.
