The complaint
Mr W complains that he was given unsuitable advice by Fiscale Financial Services Limited
(Fiscale) to transfer deferred benefits from his Defined Benefit (DB) pension with British 
Steel (BSPS) to a personal pension.
What happened
In March 2016, Tata Steel UK Ltd announced that it would be examining options to
restructure its business including decoupling the BSPS from the company. The consultation
with members referred to possible outcomes regarding their preserved pension benefits, one
of which was a transfer to the Pension Protection Fund (PPF)  the PPF is a statutory fund
designed to provide compensation to members of defined benefit pension schemes when
their employer becomes insolvent. The BSPS was closed to further benefit accrual from 31
March 2017.
In February 2017, Mr W contacted Fiscale for advice on his pension. Fiscale explained
they did not have the necessary permissions to advise Mr W on DB pension transfers
as this was a specialist area. However, they said they could refer his case to a financial
advisor who had the necessary permissions to undertake this type of work. Mr W agreed and
Fiscale emailed another firm, John Coldwell Pensions and Investments Limited (JC). It said:
I refer to our recent telephone conversation and have another referral for you, which is as
follows. We have a client in the British Steel Pension Scheme who is considering the
possibility of a transfer. I have advised him that we do not have the relevant FCA 
permissions in order to undertake work of this nature, and therefore it has been agreed that I
will source a suitable IFA who may be able to assist, i.e., yourself.
On the same day, Fiscale emailed Mr W and said:
We have now received confirmation from John Coldwell of John Coldwell Pensions & 
Investments Limited that he is taking responsibility for the pension advice to you. This being 
the case, as requested, your details have been passed to him. I understand that you have 
already arranged a meeting with John.
Mr W was subsequently advised by JC to transfer his DB benefits to a personal pension.
After the transfer, Fiscale advised Mr W on his investments within his new pension plan. He
was categorised as a cautious investor and he was recommend to invest in a cautious fund.
Fiscale became the ongoing adviser on Mr Ws pension plan.
Mr W complained both to Fiscale and JC in 2020 about the advice he received. He said both
firms are responsible for his DB transfer and any potential losses suffered. Fiscale rejected 
his complaint and said they didnt provide Mr W with any advice about transferring his DB 
pension.
Mr W referred his complaint to this service. One of our investigators considered his 
complaint but didnt uphold it. She didnt think Fiscale had given Mr W advice about the 
transfer and that they werent responsible for any losses he suffered in this respect.
Mr W disagreed and so the complaint has come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ws representatives say Fiscale and JC should both be liable for his losses. They
say both firms advised him to transfer and there was a joint venture between the firms. They
say Fiscale failed to act in Mr Ws best interest and treated him unfairly by knowingly
collaborating in a manner that led to unsuitable advice.
JC is in liquidation, so I cant consider the complaint against them. I carefully considered
whether Fiscale should be held responsible for Mr Ws losses here in some form, however I
dont think they should.
I appreciate that Mr W is unhappy that he was advised to transfer out of his BSPS scheme,
however the firm responsible for this advice is JC. They were the firm who had the relevant 
permissions and provided the formal recommendation to transfer out of his DB scheme. Its 
worth remembering that Mr W could not have transferred his DB pension without JCs 
advice. 
Fiscale did not have the required permissions to give advice on a DB pension transfer, so
they couldnt be expected to recommend Mr W not to transfer. I think there was nothing
generally wrong with referring Mr W on to a firm who could provide advice on his DB 
pension.
Mr Ws representatives say Fiscale referred a number of clients to JC and most were
advised to transfer out. However, even if this was the case, I think on balance its more likely
they referred customers to JC on the understanding they would provide suitable advice
rather than on the premise that JC would recommend a transfer whether it was suitable
or not. And its acceptable for one firm to provide transfer advice and for another to provide
investment advice.
I dont think its reasonable to expect that a firm who does not have permissions to provide
DB pension transfer advice should identify whether advice given by a firm who does have
those permissions was unsuitable. I think they were allowed to expect and rely on JC,
who were regulated and had the relevant permissions and advisers with the necessary
qualifications, to provide suitable advice.
It was ultimately JCs obligation to provide Mr W with independent and suitable advice.
And if it wasnt suitable for Mr W to transfer JC should, as the experts in this field, have
clearly told him so and provided reasons why. If they had done so, I dont think any
discussions with Fiscale would have likely made Mr W go against this advice.
In summary, Im satisfied it was JCs positive recommendation that caused Mr W to
transfer and that they are fully responsible for any losses caused by the transfer. I dont think
Mr Ws potential losses here are caused by Fiscales actions and so I dont consider it fair or
reasonable to uphold this complaint.
For completeness, I also cant see that Fiscales investment recommendation wasunsuitable.
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
