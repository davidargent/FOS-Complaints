K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that PDL Finance Limited  trading as Mr Lender  lent him money that he 
couldnt afford to repay. He wants a refund of interest and charges applied  to the loans.
background
Mr R took out five loans  with Mr Lender  between September 2014  and December 2017.  A 
summary of the loans  are below:
No. loan
Date of 
LoanAmount borrowed
Number of 
instalments Date repaid
1 26/09/2014 £500 6 14/11/2014
2 22/01/2015 £500 6 18/03/2015
3 22/09/2016 £600 6 15/03/2017 
4 22/03/2017 £600 3 10/05/2017
5 29/12/2017 £500 6 09/05/2018
Mr R says that he was trapped in a cycle  of lending and was borrowing from a number of 
payday lenders.  Mr R says that he was borrowing increasing amounts and was upset  and 
distressed by his financial  situation and he shouldnt have been given the loans which  
contributed to significant hardship.
Mr Lender recorded  Mr Rs net monthly income to be £2500 for loans 1 and 2 with monthly 
outgoings of around £750.  There was a significant gap between repaying  loan 2 and taking 
out loan 3. For loans 3-5 Mr lender recorded Mr Rs income as between £2530  and £2710 
and his outgoings were recorded  between £1775 and £2110.  Mr Lender carried out a credit  
check each time which it says didnt reveal anything that suggested a need  for further 
checks.
The adjudicator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint be upheld.  She thought that 
Mr Lender carried out adequate  checks before agreeing  to lend the first two loans. She 
thought that the gap between loans two and three suggested that a similar level of checks 
would be appropriate  for loans 3 to 5 as for the first two loans.
Mr R disagrees  with the adjudicators recommendation. Mr R says that not enough checks 
were done  for the loans and that further checks would have revealed that Mr R was heavily 
reliant on short term credit. He said that other complaints with other lenders had been 
upheld. He said that he was also making interest only repayments  which  should have alerted 
Mr Lender to his difficulty.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions of the adjudicator.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It needed  to carry out checks  to make  sure      
Mr R could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. These checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount borrowed, the repayments and any lending 
history. But there wasnt a set list of checks Mr Lender had to do.
Ref: DRN12205492loans one and two
Mr R hadnt borrowed from Mr Lender before so there wasnt  any lending history  to consider. 
The maximum monthly repayments on loans 1 and 2 represented  a fairly small proportion of 
Mr Rs declared  income. I think it wouldve been  reasonable of Mr Lender  to agree to lend 
based on his income  alone. 
Mr Lender went  further than this and asked Mr R to give it details of his monthly expenses. It 
also carried out a credit check. The check didnt  show  any defaults or anything that would 
require further  checks. I think that it was reasonable of Mr Lender to have  a degree of 
confidence that the information that Mr R gave about his income and outgoings was correct.
Im satisfied that Mr Lenders  checks went far enough before agreeing loans one and two. I 
cant say that it was wrong  to agree to the loans.
loans three  to five
Mr R took out loan three around 18 months after repaying loan 2. I think  it was fair for the 
business to conclude that this was a new lending relationship  as there was nothing to 
suggest that Mr R had ongoing  financial difficulties  or was reliant on short term credit.  There 
had been no difficulty in repaying the previous loans and loan 2 was settled early.
Mr R asked to borrow  £600  which was an increase on his previous request but he also 
declared a higher income figure. The repayment amount looked affordable on the figures Mr 
R gave and so I dont think it was wrong  for Mr Lender to approve this loan without further 
checks.
Mr R paid off loan 3 on 15 March 2017 and then applied to borrow loan 4 on 22 March  2017. 
I dont think that this short gap is enough  to say that Mr Lender should have known Mr R was 
in difficulty and asked  for more information.  I think at this stage it was still proportionate to 
rely on what Mr R said about his income  and outgoings. Mr R paid off this loan on 10 May 
2017.
Mr R asked for loan 5 on 29 December 2017 which was over 7 months  after loan 4 was 
repaid. Mr Rs borrowing  pattern doesnt suggest  reliance on short  term credit  or financial 
difficulty. 
In all the circumstances I cant  say that Mr Lender  was wrong to give Mr R the loans based 
on what it knew about Mr R at the time taking into account his borrowing history and the 
income and outgoings he had declared.
I dont doubt that Mr R was in some difficulty with payday lenders during the time he was 
borrowing from Mr Lender. If the borrowing had continued I might have expected  even 
further checks like a review of bank statements and payslips. But for the loans I have  looked  
at I think proportionate checks were carried out. The payday lending wasnt visible  to Mr 
Lender on Mr Rs credit  report and there  was nothing  in his borrowing pattern such as 
increasing sequential borrowing or repayment  difficulty that would alert Mr Lender.  
I have taken into account what Mr R says about  interest only repayments.  I can see that on 
occasions he essentially re-financed  his loans to make his repayments more manageable. 
Ref: DRN12205493But he still repaid the loans in full and on time and there was nothing in his borrowing history  
with Mr Lender that should have prompted  further checking.
I cant comment on his other complaints but what checks are proportionate will vary 
depending on the circumstances at the time and the information available  to the lender so I 
cant say that Mr Lender did anything wrong.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
