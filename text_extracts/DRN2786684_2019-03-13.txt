K820x#14complaint
Ms K complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund to her the payments that 
she made for an expedition  that didnt take place.
background 
Ms K used a credit card through her PayPal account to pay £450 to an expedition provider 
for an expedition that was to take place in July 2018.  She made further payments from a 
different credit card through her PayPal account  of £90 in early  October  2017  and £30 at the 
end of October 2017. She became aware  in April 2018 that the expedition wasnt going  to 
take place and she was advised  to claim a refund of her payments from PayPal. She made  a 
claim to PayPal in mid April 2018. It refunded  £30 to her account  but said that she wasnt 
entitled to a refund of the other payments. Ms K wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld.  She didnt think that it 
was reasonable  that PayPals buyer protection only allows a timeframe of 180 days  for a 
dispute to be raised.  And she said that Ms K wasnt aware that the expedition wouldnt take 
place until April 2018 so she couldnt raise a complaint before then. So she recommended 
that PayPal should reimburse  the £90 payment  to Ms K (but because  the £450  didnt take 
place through  PayPal,  she didnt think that it was responsible for that payment).
Ms K accepted the investigators recommendation and says that shes already started the 
claim process with her credit  card provider as suggested. But PayPal has asked for this 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says, in summary, that the payments of 
£450 and £90 were not eligible for a refund  under its buyer protection  because Ms K 
reported the claim outside the 180 day timeframe  but that the payment of £30 was refunded  
because Ms K reported that claim within the 180 day timeframe.  And its provided  further 
detail about the 180 day time limit for its buyer protection.
my provisional decision
After considering all of the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to 
Ms K and to PayPal  on 11 January 2019.  In my provisional decision I said as follows:
PayPal has refunded  the £30 payment to Ms K so I find that theres no need for me 
to consider that payment  further.
Ms K paid £450  to the expedition provider in August 2017 using a credit card through 
her PayPal account and she made another payment of £90 using a different credit 
card through her PayPal account  in early October  2017. She became aware  that the 
expedition wasnt going to take place in April 2018  and she claimed  a refund of those 
payments from PayPal in mid April 2018. But that was more than 180 days after the 
payments had been made. And PayPals terms and conditions say that:
If you wish to open a Dispute through PayPals  Resolution Centre you must  
do so within  180 days of making your payment ; and:
We may refuse to accept any Dispute that you open in relation to that 
purchase after the expiry  of that period (please be aware of this if you agree a 
delivery time of an item or performance  of a service with the Payment  
Recipient that falls after the expiry of that period).
Ref: DRN27866842PayPal has provided  evidence to show that Ms K agreed to those terms and 
conditions when she opened her account in April 2016.
Ms K says that she was advised to claim refunds from PayPal and that other 
customers have received refunds. This service considers each complaint on its 
individual merits and the circumstances of other customers  refunds may be different. 
So just because other customers have received refunds of their payments, it doesnt  
mean that Ms Ks payments should be refunded.
I consider that PayPal  has correctly applied the terms  and conditions of Ms Ks 
account to the payments that she made.  I sympathise  with Ms K because she didnt 
know that the expedition wasnt  going  to take place until more than 180 days after 
shed made  the payments of £450 and £90. But Im not persuaded that it would  be 
fair or reasonable  in these circumstances for me to require PayPal to refund either of 
those payments to her  or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
So subject to any further representations by Ms K or PayPal, my provisional  decision was 
that I wasnt minded  to uphold this complaint.
PayPal has accepted my provisional decision but Ms K hasnt responded to it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ms K was sent my provisional decision using the correct postal address in January 2019. As 
no response had been  received, the investigator also sent it to her by e-mail using the 
correct e-mail address later that month.  But Ms K hasnt responded to my provisional 
decision. So Im not persuaded  that I should  change  my provisional decision. 
my decision
For the reasons  set out above, my decision is that I dont  uphold Ms Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2019.
