The complaint
Mr B complains that he received poor service from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest).
What happened
Mr B applied for a new current account with NatWest in October 2020. On 16 October 2020, 
they advised Mr B that theyd declined to open the account. 
Mr B complained that hed been told he had passed the checks. He wasnt aware there 
would be further checks. So, he had told his employer about his new account details. He 
spent many hours on the phone trying to contact the account opening team. They didnt call 
him back as promised. When he did speak to NatWest, they were rude. The complaints case 
handler didnt respond to his messages. NatWest misinformed him about how long the 
payment of compensation would take. NatWest didnt respond to his GDPR request in the 
stated timescales. And their final response letter was damaged  he asked for a 
replacement, but it didnt arrive for three months.
NatWest said their decision on the account opening remained the same  and they didnt 
need to explain why Mr B was rejected for an account. But their decision followed a check on 
Mr Bs credit file. They agreed that Mr B wasnt advised that secondary checks were to be 
made  and apologised and paid compensation of £75. They asked Mr B for details of this 
call costs so they might consider these.
Mr B brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that NatWest had agreed 
that they hadnt told Mr B about the secondary checks they were to carry out. And  that hed 
had trouble in contacting the account opening team; and he had had to wait a long time for a 
replacement final response letter. Hed also been misinformed about how long it would take 
for the compensation to be paid. But she could see that NatWest had agreed, and paid 
compensation of £75  which she thought was reasonable.
Mr B asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr B applied for a new current account and he was advised that a card and 
pin number was on its way to him. But he then failed NatWests secondary checks  and so 
they stopped the account opening process and closed his account. By then, Mr B said he 
had advised his employer of his new account details  this was inconvenient as he needed 
to unwind everything. He tried to call NatWest to discuss things and spent hours on the 
phone. He was passed from person to person and department to department. When he did 
speak to NatWest, they were rude. He says NatWest took too long to respond to his 
complaint. And when they agreed to pay compensation, they misinformed him of the 
timescales for that to be credited to his account. He says they breached GDPR guidelines 
after he made a data subject access request. He wants another £100 compensation.
Its up to NatWest whether they open an account for someone or not. And  if they fail to 
pass its tests, they dont have to say why. But I can see from their final response that theyve 
indicated that there was something on Mr Bs credit file that caused them to stop the account 
opening process  so Mr B might wish to check his credit file to see whats showing, and if 
theres something on it he doesnt agree with, he should contact the credit reference 
agencies to ask for it to be reviewed or changed. 
Mr B clearly spent a long time trying to speak to NatWest about his account request  but to 
be fair, he had been told by NatWest that hed not passed their tests and it was his choice to 
try to contest the decision. And  NatWest have asked him for his call costs which they said 
they would consider  Mr B hasnt been able to give these as he says he cant access them 
as he was on a PAYG deal at the time. But the fact is  we wouldnt expect NatWest to 
consider these without any evidence.
I have listed to the calls in question and I agree that NatWests call handlers werent rude. 
Ive looked at what NatWest told Mr B about how long the compensation would take to be 
paid. They said it would take two days  and it took five days. So  I dont think that was a 
long delay. I can see that the replacement FRL that Mr B asked for wasnt received by him 
for three months. This was frustrating and was a long time for him to wait.
On the matter of how long it took NatWest to deal with Mr Bs complaint  he was told it 
would take 56 days. This time is within the FCAs guidelines for complaint handling (either 
weeks)  and so I think this was OK.
Mr B had raised the timescales for NatWest to provide their response to his data subject 
access request. The guidance here is one month  NatWest took two days more than that. 
While I dont think this caused a great deal of problem, its for Mr B to raise with the 
Information Commissioners Office if he wishes - as they are the guardians of this aspect. 
I accept the whole experience was frustrating for Mr B. NatWest apologised for the 
misinformation he was given at the outset about the account opening. Mr B wants more 
compensation  this is of course a subjective matter. But in all the circumstances of what 
happened, I think NatWest dealt with Mr Bs complaint fairly and their compensation of £75 
was adequate for what happened. This is in line with what this service would expect to see 
here.
And so  I wont be asked NatWest to do anymore here.
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2021.
