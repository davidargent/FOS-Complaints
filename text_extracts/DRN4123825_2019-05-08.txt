K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd (trading as Marbles) sold his debt to a debt management 
company when it should not have done so.
background
Mr H contacted NewDay in May 2018  saying that he had applied for an IVA and he provided  
the relevant reference number. At the end of June NewDay included Mr As credit card 
account in the batch  of accounts earmarked for sale to a debt management company (dmc).
Mr Hs IVA application was initially refused  and 9 July he informed NewDay. He also 
mentioned his health conditions during  this call. 
On 31 July NewDay learnt that Mr Hs IVA application had been successful and had been 
registered. It sold his debt to the dmc that day. 
Mr H complained to NewDay that it had sold his debt without  telling him that it intended to do 
so and after having said that it would  help him.
NewDay replied saying  that it reserved the right to pass an account  to its collections 
department where  the contract had been breached and without the account holders prior 
knowledge. It said it had passed Mr Hs account  to the debt recovery unit on 19 June.
Mr H was unhappy with this response and complained to us.
Our adjudicator produced two views on this complaint. In her first she said she didnt 
consider that NewDay had done  anything wrong.  NewDay had said that it was primarily a 
credit card company and not a debt collection agency. Consequently, its terms and 
conditions included provision to transfer accounts to a third party if, amongst other  things, 
the account holder became bankrupt or applied  for a debt relief order, as Mr H had.
Mr H disagreed with this view and highlighted conversations hed had with NewDay, in 
particular with reference to his health.  And so having considered  the details of NewDays  
vulnerability procedure,  which  said that the business  would not sell a debt where it identified  
a vulnerable customer, our adjudicator revised  her view. She said that NewDays internal 
notes showed  that it knew  about  Mr Hs health  conditions by 9 July at the latest, which  
preceded the date of the debt sale. Her view was therefore that NewDay had been wrong to 
proceed with the sale. To put things  right she said NewDay should buy back  Mr Hs debt 
from the dmc, and pay him £200.
Mr H accepted her findings, but NewDay did not. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has said that as it is mainly a credit  card provider it is not well placed to manage  
debt collection or IVAs. Its account  terms and conditions  reflect this by stating that it may 
transfer debts to a third party  organisation under  certain circumstances, including where the 
account holder  becomes bankrupt or applies for a debt relief order. All other  things being 
Ref: DRN41238252equal therefore, NewDay was entirely within its rights to decide  to sell Mr Hs debt to a dmc 
once he had entered into an IVA.
But NewDays right to sell a debt must  be seen within  the context of its overall terms and 
conditions, and these  make separate provision for customers  it identifies  as vulnerable. It 
sets out triggers it considers would indicate that a customer  may potentially fall into this 
category. And where a customer  has been identified as vulnerable, NewDay states very 
clearly under  a heading Removal  from debt sale that it must  not sell a debt or pass it to a 
debt purchaser .  
Having been informed by Mr H that he had applied for an IVA, NewDay  selected his account 
for sale to a dmc. This decision was taken at the end of June, but was not actioned  until 31 
July after Mr Hs IVA application  had finally been  approved. But on 9 July, and during a 
phone call from Mr H informing NewDay that his first IVA application had been unsuccessful 
he also described his various medical conditions. Mr H has said that he had informed 
NewDay previously,  although  NewDays notes dont  reflect this.
But by 9 July at the latest NewDay knew that Mr H had problems with his health.  And 
NewDays notes that day give sufficient detail of those problems for it to have realised  that 
Mr H was potentially a vulnerable customer. I should  also state that Mr H has subsequently 
provided us with evidence of his health  conditions, which  reflects NewDays notes of 9 July.
Having considered NewDays vulnerability  policy I have no doubt that the conditions Mr H 
described during  his 9 July phone call should  have  alerted the business to the fact that he 
was potentially a vulnerable customer.  It should not therefore have proceeded with the debt 
sale until it had established  whether  or not he was.
Its arguments for continuing with the sale appear to suggest that as it wasnt  aware of Mr Hs 
health condition  when it initially selected  his debt for sale at the end of June that was 
sufficient justification  for subsequently proceeding with the sale.
But Im afraid I disagree with NewDay on this point and I find its actions neither fair nor 
reasonable given that the sale did not proceed  until the end of July, by which  time it was fully 
aware that Mr H might  be a vulnerable customer.
Given this, my decision is that NewDay should  buy back  Mr Hs debt and then follow  its 
procedure for establishing  whether he is a vulnerable customer. NewDay  should  also pay Mr 
H £200 as compensation for both the inconvenience  and upset  it has caused him.
Ref: DRN41238253my final decision
I uphold Mr Hs complaint  against  NewDay and I require it to:
Buy back  his debt from the debt management  company 
Pay him £200 directly  for the upset  and inconvenience it has caused him
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 June 2019.
