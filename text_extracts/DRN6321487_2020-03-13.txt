K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  that Aviva Insurance Limited is responsible for mishandling  her claim in 
connection with a home emergency insurance  policy.
background
The Financial Ombudsman  Service deals with a complaint about a claim under an insurance 
policy as a complaint  against the insurance  company responsible  for dealing  with the claim. 
In our final decision we name the insurance  company  but we dont name anyone  else.
Miss B was living with a baby. She had a policy that covered her central heating boiler. The 
policy was in the name of a home assistance  company.  
Aviva was the insurer responsible for dealing  with claims. Where I refer to Aviva I include the 
home assistance company and others insofar  as I hold Aviva responsible for their actions.
Miss Bs boiler was over seven years  old. The policy provided as follows:
If the boiler is deemed beyond economical  repair and is 7 years or older,  we will 
source, replace  and install a new boiler but you will be required to pay the installation 
costs. We will provide  for you, a quote for this work
On 18 January 2019 Miss Bs boiler broke down. On about 23 January 2019 Aviva said it 
was beyond economic repair (BER). It was prepared to supply a new boiler free of charge. 
But it quoted  £1,213.04  for installation (plus £149.00 for a filter). Miss B got a lower 
installation quote  elsewhere. Aviva  offered  £369.00 in lieu of supplying  a new boiler.  
Miss B complained. Aviva  wrote a final response  letter dated 1 February  2019.  
On 7 February 2019 Miss B wrote a letter of complaint  to the home assistance company  with 
a copy to us. She asked  the company to supply a new boiler free of charge. The company 
didnt do so. Miss B engaged a local company to supply and install a new boiler.
our adjudicators opinion
Our adjudicator treated  the complaint as against  the home assistance company. He 
recommended that the complaint should  be upheld. He thought  that the home assistance 
company shouldve agreed  to provide the boiler  as there was no financial detriment. 
The adjudicator recommended that the home  assistance company should  - upon  receipt  of 
an invoice showing the cost of the boiler  - pay Miss B the difference  between what  it cost her 
for the replacement boiler and what the company  had already contributed.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss B 
and to Aviva  on 28 February  2020.  I summarise my findings:
On 1 February 2019 Aviva said it would arrange  payment of £449.00 within  the next 
few days. From the call recording I was minded  to find that Miss B accepted that 
offer.
Ref: DRN63214872I was minded to find that the payment of £449.00 completed a settlement agreement.  
That was the main reason that I wasnt minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct 
Aviva to pay Miss B the balance of the cost of her boiler - or any further  payment.
Subject to any further information from Miss B or from Aviva, my provisional  decision was 
that I wasnt minded  to uphold this complaint. I didnt intend  to direct Aviva  Insurance Limited 
to do any more in response to this complaint.
Aviva says it has nothing to add in response  to the provisional decision.
Miss B disagrees with the provisional decision. She says, in summary, that:
The baby  wasnt hers.
The policy wording was misleading.  It didnt say she was duty-bound to accept 
Avivas installation quote in order to qualify  for the boiler.
The call on 26 January 2019 was also misleading. Aviva  said she could  get an 
alternative installation-only quote  from a Gas Safe Registered  engineer.  This led her 
to believe that the home assistance company would supply the boiler to be fitted.
Any fault with the installation would  fall to the company/engineer that fitted  it. If there 
was a fault with the boiler within  the first year, the responsibility would have been with 
the supplier and thereafter  the manufacturer.
If she was being  given no choice but to accept Avivas quote to qualify for the boiler, 
she would expect  their charges to be fair and equitable which at 3 times the current  
market rate they were not.  
She was able to source, supply and fit the boiler  for the same cost.
The boiler was a combination boiler  providing  heat and hot water, meaning she was 
without both for over a month in freezing  temperatures.
All her searches suggested  the boiler was approximately  £900 plus VAT.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From what  Ive seen, Miss B had an old boiler. From Avivas file, I see that the policy  was 
renewed on 13 March  2018. Miss B says she was paying Aviva  the yearly  premium by 
instalments of about £30.00.
Miss B already had a problem when she contacted  Aviva in January 2019. Thats why she 
contacted Aviva. Her old boiler  had broken down during a period of very cold weather. Some  
of the spare parts necessary to repair it were  obsolete. So she was going to need  a new 
boiler and that was bound to take some time. 
Ref: DRN63214873On Sunday 20 January Aviva  disconnected the old boiler from gas and electricity.  It left three 
electric fan heaters. Miss B said later (in her letter of 7 February  2019)  that Aviva  sent her 
£50.00 as compensation for the cost of running the heaters.
Ive listened to the call on 26 January 2019.  Miss B was complaining  about  Avivas  quote of 
over £1,200.00 for installation. And she was asking whether she could get a local Gas Safe 
engineer to provide an alternative  lower  quote. I consider that it was implicit that Miss B 
was still expecting Aviva  to supply a new boiler free of charge. 
The call-handler said Miss B could get a quote and send  it in. That wasnt a commitment  that 
Aviva would supply  a new boiler  to her installer. 
I can understand that Miss B wanted  Aviva to send her a free boiler but didnt want to pay its 
quote for installation. And  as the final response letter  later acknowledged  the call-handler  
couldve been clearer. And the call-handler  didnt say what  Aviva  later said  that it wouldnt 
supply a free boiler to Miss B for someone  else to install. 
So Miss B got a quote for installation (and supply of the filter) of £450.00  plus VAT  a total 
of £540.00. She sent that quote to Aviva. It declined to provide a replacement boiler for 
someone else to install.  Aviva had caused some delay as the weather  got even colder. 
Aviva said it would pay the £369.00 the boiler wouldve cost it  without VAT. Miss B couldnt 
get a replacement boiler at that price   or without paying VAT.
I consider that Aviva  had caused  Miss B some  delay over and above the time a claim would 
usually take.
But in my view the policy  didnt require Aviva to supply  a new boiler for installation  by others. 
And a telephone call couldnt  change that. So I dont  find that Aviva  treated Miss B unfairly 
by offering her the alternative  of £369.00.
With Miss Bs agreement,  the policy was cancelled.  But a few days later an instalment of 
about £30.00 was collected by direct  debit. 
Ive listened to the call on 1 February  2019.  From that, I find that Miss B understood that 
Aviva was only offering  £369.00 in lieu of a free boiler. She said she was only asking  for a 
further £50.00  and a rapid  refund  of the recent direct debit of £30.00.
The call-handler checked the amount of the refund and told her it would only be £7.42. So he 
offered to increase the £50.00 by £30.00  to £80.00.  That was in addition  to the £369.00  
(making a total of £449.00) and the refund  of £7.42 which  had already been  processed for 
payment. He said he would arrange  payment of the £449.00 within  the next few days. 
From the call recording I find that Miss B accepted that offer. Aviva wrote  a letter  the same  
day. It included  the following:
In full and final settlement of your complaint,  you have agreed and accepted my 
resolution of £449  compensation, this includes the £369 boiler cost and £80 for 
distress and inconvenience.
And I find it likely that the money arrived in Miss Bs account before 7 February 2019. 
Ref: DRN63214874In her letter of complaint  dated 7 February 2019,  Miss B omitted to mention the call or letter 
dated 1 February  2019 or the payment of £449.00.  But she asked Aviva to increase its offer 
and to supply  a boiler.
She said she had got a revised quote  of £1,652.00 for supply and installation.  She said this 
made the cost of the boiler  £900.00  plus VAT (which I find is £1,080.00). So I think  she was 
deducting about £572.00 for installation. I havent  seen  that quote.
Ive seen an invoice  dated 8 March  2019 for the supply and installation of the new boiler.  It is 
not from the same installer who did the installation  quote of £540.00. The invoice is for 
£1,350.00 plus VAT - a total of £1,620.00. The installer later broke that down as follows:
for the boiler £1,014.00  plus VAT (£202.80)  a total of £1,216.80
for labour    £336.00 plus VAT (£67.20)  a total of    £403.20
total    £1,620.00
I find that the payment of £449.00 completed  a settlement agreement.  Thats the main 
reason that I dont  find it fair and reasonable  to direct Aviva to pay Miss B the balance of the 
cost of her boiler - or any further payment.
In any event, the policy didnt require Aviva  to supply a new boiler for installation  by others. 
So I find its offer of £369.00  fair and reasonable. And I find Avivas payment of £80.00  fair 
and reasonable for causing  delays  and their effects on Miss B.
So I dont  find it fair and reasonable to direct  Aviva or to do anything further in response to 
Miss Bs complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Aviva Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 April 2020.
