DRN-1511919
The complaint
Mr D complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance (BPF) applied a refund to the outstanding balance of a loan that was included in an 
IVA. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
BPF completed a remediation exercise and found it had overcharged Mr D for his 
loan. I would only expect a business to refund loan overpayments if the outstanding 
balance had already been repaid. 
Whilst Mr Ds loan was included in an IVA, it wasnt repaid in full. Im satisfied that 
BPFs decision to pass the refund onto the new owner of Mr Ds loan is reasonable 
as it has reduced the amount outstanding. 
If BPF hadnt used the refund to reduce the outstanding balance its possible Mr Ds 
IVA administrator would have requested the funds be paid to them for disbursement. 
BPF accepts Mr D was incorrectly told the refund would be paid directly to him. But 
that was a mistake and Im satisfied the Â£50 it paid Mr D fairly takes BPFs error into 
account. As Im satisfied BPF has dealt with this complaint fairly Im not telling it to do 
anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
