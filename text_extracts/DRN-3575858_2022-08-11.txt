The complaint
Mrs F complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) wont refund money she says was lost as 
part of a scam.
What happened
In October 2015, Mrs F opened a trading account with a company Ill refer to as L. Between 
October 2015 and February 2016 Mrs F placed trades on her account with L. L was a parent 
company of two other business entities who Ill refer to as L2 and L3. 
Ive included a table of the payments as there are a number of different payments and 
credits received from all three business entities.

The background to this complaint isnt in dispute and was covered by the investigator in their 
view, so I wont go into detail. In summary, Mrs F claims that she was never actually trading 
on the live stockmarket and was instead presented with a fictitious copy of the market where 
L used a sophisticated trading software to manipulate the prices. Mrs F says they initially 
lured her in by allowing her to make big profits, so shed continue to add more funds. 
However, when she tried to withdraw funds at the peak of the successful trades, she was 
told that she couldnt and suddenly her trades started making losses and her balance was 
wiped out. 
Mrs F raised a fraud claim with HSBC in 2021, saying she had fallen victim to a multi-layered 
investment scam, and asking HSBC to help recover her lost funds. HSBC told Mrs F that 
they were unable to help her, saying that her payments were made prior to the Contingent 
Reimbursement Model (the CRM Code) which was introduced in May 2019  so she wasnt 
entitled to a refund under the Code. And, due to the amount of time that had passed, they 
were unable to help her recover her funds directly from the beneficiary.
Mrs F wasnt happy with HSBCs response, so she brought a complaint to our service. As 
part of that complaint, additional payments were identified that were made to L, L2 and L3. 
On providing HSBC with a list of all the payments Mrs F was complaining about, HSBC told 
us they objected to us looking into the first two payments made in April 2015 (in bold in the 
table above)  saying Mrs F had raised her complaint about those payments too late.
An investigator considered HSBCs objection regarding us looking into the first two payments 
and agreed that Mrs F had brought her complaint too late. Therefore, the investigator 
couldnt consider a complaint about those payments. The investigator reviewed Mrs Fs 
complaint regarding the remaining payments and told Mrs F she couldnt fairly ask HSBC to 
refund her. The investigator felt that Mrs Fs loss related to a bad investment and 
dissatisfaction with the trade returns, rather than L, L2 or L3 having set out with the intention 
to defraud her. As such, the investigator couldnt fairly hold HSBC liable.
Mrs F disagreed with the investigators opinion, so the complaint was passed to me to 
review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Why I cant consider a complaint about the first two payments made in April 2015 to L2
As our investigator explained, our service isnt free to consider every complaint thats 
brought to us. Were governed by rules set by the industry regulator, the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). Theyre called the DISP rules and are found in the FCAs handbook, which 
is available online. The DISP rules are quite clear on when we can and cannot look into a 
complaint. And, if a business doesnt consent, our service cant consider a complaint which 
isnt made within specified time limits. 
DISP rule 2.8.2R says we cant consider a complaint if it was referred more than six years 
after the event complained of; or (if later) three years from the date on which the complainant 
became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they had cause for 
complaint. 
In this case, HSBC have objected to us looking into Mrs Fs complaint, saying it wasnt 
brought in time. 
The first two payments that Mrs F is complaining about were made in April 2015, this means 
that Mrs F had to raise a complaint before 30 April 2021  whereas she raised her complaint 
on 7 May 2021. I realise that this is only a matter of days later, however the rules are strict 
and Im unable to bend or waive them. Therefore, Mrs F hasnt brought her complaint within 
six years for those payments.
The three-year time limit allows for situations where a complainant ought reasonably to have 
become aware they had cause to complain at a later point, after the event happened. In Mrs 
Fs case, I consider she ought reasonably to have been aware she had cause to complain in April 2016, when she raised a complaint directly with L. In order to meet the three year time 
limit, Mrs F wouldve needed to complain to HSBC by April 2019  so the three year time 
limit doesnt apply in this case as it doesnt provide a later date than the six year time limit. 
Mrs F has provided a letter written to HSBC about her complaint in January 2021, however 
HSBC have no record of this letter. I can only use this letter to say the time limit was met if 
there is written acknowledgement or some other record of the business receiving it  which 
there isnt in this case. 
I can look into a case brought outside of the six-year time limit if I establish there were 
exceptional circumstances that prevented Mrs F from bringing her complaint in time. 
However, Mrs F hasnt provided us with any exceptional circumstances that meant she was 
prevented from bringing her complaint in time. 
So, I cant consider a complaint about the first two payments Mrs F made in April 2015.
Can I hold HSBC liable for the remaining payments made from May 2015 to March 2016?
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that a bank is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the customers account. And I have taken that into account when looking into 
what is fair and reasonable in this case. 
In May 2019, the Lending Standards Board introduced the voluntary Contingent 
Reimbursement Model (the CRM Code) which HSBC are signed up to. However, the Code 
cannot be applied retrospectively to payments made before May 2019, therefore I cant hold 
HSBC liable due to any obligation under the Code.
But even where the payments arent covered by the CRM Code, a bank has to be on the 
lookout for and help to prevent payments that could involve fraud or be the result of a scam. 
And Id expect a bank to take steps in those circumstances to help protect its customers 
from suffering a loss. However, that duty doesnt extend to payments that arent made as a 
result of a scam. There isnt an obligation on HSBC to protect Mrs F from making a bad 
investment or potentially risking her money by entering into a high-risk investment. So, in 
Mrs Fs case I would need to be persuaded that the payments she made were done as part 
of a scam whereby L, L2 and L3 set out with the intention to defraud her. 
Having considered everything very carefully, Im not persuaded that Mrs F was the victim of 
a scam for the following reasons:
L was and is a registered company in the UK and has been incorporated since June 
1996. Ls met its regulatory requirement of submitting accounts and I cant see any 
strike-off or winding up orders. If a company was set up to defraud customers, I 
wouldnt expect it to continue trading for such an extended period of time, as usually 
scam reports come through quite quickly if returns arent being paid. 
L is also authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority and has been since 
December 2001. The activities they are authorised for include dealing in investments 
as agents and dealing in investments as principles. If they were set up with the 
intention of defrauding customers, its likely theyd act without authorisation and not 
have gone through the steps required to obtain authorisation. Or, Id expect to see a 
warning from the FCA, for example that their authorisation had been revoked or that 
they were carrying out unregulated activities. There is a warning about a cloned 
investment company which was set up to trick customers into thinking they were 
investing with L, but Im not persuaded that Mrs F was dealing with a cloned firm.Im persuaded Mrs F was dealing with the genuine firm L, rather than a cloned firm, 
as an account was opened with the genuine firm and when she wrote a letter of 
complaint it went to the genuine firms contact information. L investigated that 
complaint and provided a response. All of the communication Ive seen has been with 
the genuine firm. 
The complaint that Mrs F raised with L directly in April 2016, referred to 
dissatisfaction that a large number of trades had been rejected by L. In its response L 
pointed to its terms and conditions and the various situations whereby they would 
reject a trade, providing details of the main reasons Mrs Fs trades were rejected. I 
wouldnt expect this level of engagement if L wasnt a genuine firm.  
Importantly, I wouldnt expect firms that were scamming customers to provide the 
volume and frequency of withdrawals that Mrs F was able to make. Mrs F made 
payments of nearly £67,000 from her HSBC account to the three entities. But, she 
was able to withdraw over £40,000, meaning Mrs Fs overall loss based on the 
payments that went through her HSBC account is around £25,000. I realise that is 
still a large loss, however the size of the withdrawals and the fact they were received 
over a period that spanned nearly 12 months, doesnt suggest to me that it was a 
scam. Also, Mrs F received more credits into her account from L and L2, than she 
made in payments out to them. 
Having considered all the information that is available about L, Im not satisfied I can safely 
conclude that Mrs F was the victim of a scam or that L set out with the intention to defraud 
Mrs F. I think the information and evidence we have suggest its more likely that the loss Mrs 
F has suffered is as a result of a high risk investment or due to her not receiving the return 
she expected on her money. 
As L was the parent company of L2 and L3, I think it follows that a finding that L didnt set 
out with the intention to scam Mrs F, allows me to conclude that L2 or L3 as subsidiaries 
didnt either. Which is supported by the credits Mrs F received from all three business 
entities.
As Im not convinced that Mrs F was the victim of a scam, I cant fairly say HSBC shouldve 
intervened or tried to prevent the payments Mrs F made and therefore cant fairly hold them 
liable for Mrs Fs loss.
For completeness, I think its worth noting that even if I was persuaded that any of the 
payments were made as a result of a scam, I still wouldnt ask HSBC to refund Mrs F. I say 
this because Mrs F was investing with a business (L) authorised by the FCA, which had no 
FCA warnings, was a duly incorporated company which had been established for a 
significant period of time and was carrying out activity in line with its authorisation. In a case, 
where we say a business shouldve identified a customer was potentially at risk of financial 
harm from a scam  we would expect them to ask questions. But, we wouldnt expect them 
to interrogate the investment or the business. And, based on the information that was 
available at the time of making the payment, there would be no reason for HSBC to believe 
Mrs F was the victim of a scam and prevent her from making the payments.
I realise that Mrs F is going to be very disappointed, but I cant fairly hold HSBC response for 
her loss.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint against HSBC UK Bank Plc.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
