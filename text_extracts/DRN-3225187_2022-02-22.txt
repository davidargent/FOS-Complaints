The complaint
Mr O complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA made changes to their processes for 
accessing and using his account which required him to own a mobile phone. Mr O doesnt 
use a mobile phone because he lives in an area of poor reception. He says he closed his 
PayPal account out of frustration because they wouldnt offer him a resolution.
What happened
Mr O was a longstanding customer of PayPal. In early 2020 he experienced a problem when 
making a payment to a retailer. When he got in touch with PayPal about this, he says he was 
told hed be unable to continue to use PayPal without a mobile phone. They told him this 
was because PayPal were implementing strong customer authentication (SCA) and needed 
a mobile phone number to send authentication codes to.
Reluctantly, Mr O agreed to provide his daughters mobile phone number on the 
understanding that PayPal wouldnt use it but would make a note that only his landline 
number should be used for authentication codes. Mr O said he thought hed sorted the 
problem with this compromise and felt satisfied his daughter wouldnt be disturbed.
Sometime later, Mr Os daughter received calls from PayPal. Mr O says this caused some 
tension between them. After failing to get in touch with PayPal and trying unsuccessfully to 
amend the telephone numbers on his account, he decided to close it.
When Mr O brought his complaint to this service, he explained that he lives in a remote area 
and relies on making online purchases. He prefers using PayPal to do this rather than 
sharing his payment card details with multiple retailers.
Mr O told us he wants PayPal to, Understand that not everyone has a mobile and accept 
my house phone as before.
What PayPal told us
PayPal explained that theyd made changes to the way customers access their accounts in 
response to the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which brought in a requirement for 
payment service providers to implement SCA. So, Mr O could no longer access his account 
by simply using his email address and entering his password. He was required to also 
confirm a telephone number linked to his account so that he could receive a code to it or 
enter a code displayed on the PayPal screen into the telephone keypad when he received 
an automated call.
Mr O was asked to add a mobile phone number to his account in order to be able to receive 
codes to access his account or perform transactions. He did so in April 2020, and as this 
was the only confirmed telephone number linked to his account the code was sent there. 
PayPal said the landline numbers on Mr Os account were unconfirmed and thats why he 
was unable to select either of them as his primary phone number.
PayPal said that if an existing customer only has a landline phone number it can be used for 
authentication, but that number must first be confirmed. As Mr O hadnt done that, PayPal 
didnt think theyd done anything wrong.
PayPal also explained that having a mobile phone number is now a requirement for 
creating a new PayPal account. So, if Mr O wants to open a new account, hell no longer 
have the option to use his landline phone number for authentication. They said:
PayPal implemented Strong Customer Authentication  In order to avoid disruption 
to customers, PayPal offered the option to use a landline phone number or a third 
party authenticator app (for business accounts) to those existing customers that did 
not have the possibility to add a mobile phone number to their account  New 
customers, on the other hand, need a mobile phone number to register a PayPal 
account. We do not exclude that this requirement may change in the future, but it is 
mandatory at present.
Our investigators view
Our investigator upheld Mr Os complaint. He said he didnt think PayPal had acted fairly 
towards Mr O because, despite Mr O telling them that he didnt own a mobile phone, PayPal 
had made it seem essential that he add one to his account. He also didnt think PayPal had 
helped Mr O to do what was necessary to confirm his landline telephone number so that he 
could use it for authentication. He said PayPal should have done more to explain Mr Os 
authentication options, and he thought it more likely than not Mr O would have opted for 
authentication by landline if hed been given this option.
The investigator said that PayPal should compensate Mr O for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by their poor service with £100.
Acknowledging that Mr O had only resorted to closing his account because of PayPals poor 
service, our investigator said that PayPal should:
allow Mr O to open a new account if he wishes;
if he does so, remove any mobile number PayPal holds for Mr O from his account;
confirm Mr Os landline number for future use; and
allow Mr O to complete SCA using a landline number as if he were an existing, rather 
than a new, customer.
Responses to the view
Mr O accepted this outcome. PayPal didnt. PayPal said theyd acted fairly by using the 
mobile number linked to Mr Os account for authentication, because that was the only 
confirmed telephone number on the account. They also said that theyd be unable to open a 
new account for Mr O without a mobile phone number.
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on 7 December 2021. I began by setting out the 
considerations I thought relevant to my decision. I wrote:
Im required to determine this complaint by reference to what I consider to be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. When considering what is fair 
and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant law and regulations; 
regulators' rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where appropriate, 
what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
So, Ill start by setting out what I have identified as the relevant considerations to 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
The Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs) Reg. 100, which came into force on 
14 September 2019, says that a payment service provider (PSP) must apply strong 
customer authentication where a payment service user accesses its payment 
account online, initiates an electronic payment transaction; or carries out any action 
through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses.
SCA is defined in the PSRs. It means:
authentication based on the use of two or more elements that are independent, in 
that the breach of one element does not compromise the reliability of any other 
element, and designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the 
authentication data, with the elements falling into two or more of the following 
categories
(a) something known only by the payment service user (knowledge);
(b) something held only by the payment service user (possession);
(c) something inherent to the payment service user (inherence);
Another relevant consideration is the SCA implementation guidance issued by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in its document Payment Services and Electronic 
Money  Our Approach (June 2019) and related statements. Ive referred to the 
detail of these below.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator and for broadly 
the same reasons.
Mr O lives in a remote area with poor mobile phone reception. So, when PayPal 
asked him to add a mobile phone number to his account, I think its unlikely hed 
have done so if hed been told he had an alternative option to authenticate by 
landline. As I dont think he was told about this option by PayPal or supported by 
them to confirm his landline number, I dont think PayPal treated him fairly. And its 
only because of this unfair treatment that Mr O became frustrated and closed his 
account.
Our role is to consider whether financial businesses, in this case PayPal, have acted 
fairly and reasonably in the circumstances of a complaint. Where they havent, we 
consider the consequences of what theyve done and try to put the complainant back 
in the position they would otherwise have been in.
With this in mind I think that if Mr O wishes to resume his relationship with PayPal, PayPal should offer him an authentication option that doesnt rely on a mobile phone. 
I say this for three reasons.
Firstly, I think Mr O would have continued to hold his PayPal account had it not been 
for the lack of support PayPal offered him following the introduction of SCA. And on 
that basis, I think he ought to be offered the same authentication options as other 
existing customers for whom theres been no break in relationship. That means I 
think he should be allowed to choose to authenticate by landline, as PayPal have told 
us this is an option available to existing customers.
Secondly, I think Mr O should be offered an authentication option that doesnt rely on 
a mobile phone because the relevant regulatory and industry guidance has made it 
clear payment service providers (PSPs) should be designing SCA processes that 
reflect the fact not everyone owns a mobile phone.
The FCAs guidance document says:
 it may be necessary for a PSP to provide different methods of authentication, to 
comply with their obligation to apply strong customer authentication in line with 
[PSD2]. For example, not all payment service users will possess a mobile phone or 
smart phone and payments may be made in areas without mobile phone reception. 
PSPs must provide a viable means to strongly authenticate customers in these 
situations. (my emphasis)
In its statement of expectations published in September 2019, the FCA also said:
We expect firms to develop SCA solutions that work for all groups of consumers. 
This means that you may need to provide several different methods of authentication 
for your customers. This includes methods that dont rely on mobile phones, to cater 
for consumers who dont have, or wont want to use, a mobile phone.
I think the message of this guidance is that whilst PSPs must implement SCA they 
should also do so in a way that maintains the accessibility of their services for a 
broad range of customers. PSPs should be designing SCA processes with all their 
customers and potential customers in mind, not designing processes which exclude 
those who dont have access to, or cant use, mobile phones. So, I dont think its 
reasonable for PayPal to only offer Mr O the option of authenticating with a mobile 
phone. Im also mindful that PayPal already offer some customers alternatives to 
authenticating by mobile phone and Ive seen nothing to persuade me that this 
offering shouldnt be extended to Mr O.
And thirdly, PayPal havent provided any justification for why mobile phone 
ownership is essential for Mr O to operate a PayPal account. Although I appreciate 
PayPals preferred option is to authenticate their customers by mobile phone, I think 
its relevant that Mr O managed to operate his account without one for many years 
until the advent of SCA.
Whilst the requirement to implement SCA is a significant change for both PSPs and 
their customers, I think the new rules have been introduced to provide further 
protection from fraud, not to exclude customers from services they were previously 
able to use. PayPals implementation of SCA has had the effect of excluding Mr O 
from having a PayPal account, and I dont think thats either the intention of the SCA 
rules or fair.
Overall, I dont currently think PayPal have acted fairly or reasonably by only offering Mr O one way of authenticating and by doing so preventing him from having a 
PayPal account. To put things right I provisionally think PayPal should offer Mr O the 
remedy already set out by the investigator.
Responses to my Provisional Decision
PayPal didnt agree with my provisional decision. They said in most instances PayPal will be 
able to authenticate someone by their password and device recognition but when thats not 
possible an OTP is sent to the customers mobile phone number via SMS text message. 
They said:
At present, it is not possible to proceed with this verification using a landline phone 
number, as this type of phone wont allow for the receipt of the one-time passcode 
via SMS.
PayPal said they regret the inconvenience caused to Mr O from adding and confirming his 
daughters mobile phone number on his PayPal account. They went on to say that Mr O can 
open a new PayPal account as a new customer but he will have to add a mobile phone 
number to it as it is a requirement in order to proceed with SCA.
Further information
Before reaching my final decision, I asked PayPal to confirm what authentication options 
they offer existing customers. I asked for this clarity because theyd said both that existing 
customers were offered the option to use a landline phone number, and that verification 
using a landline phone number was not possible at present. PayPal provided the following 
further information:
New customers do not have the option to use a landline for SCA.
For SCA PayPal send an OTP by SMS to the customers mobile phone  this can by 
received via WhatsApp depending on market availability.
Customers may also be presented with the opportunity to confirm a transaction via 
the PayPal App.
The other option is to use an authenticator app that can be downloaded to a desktop 
personal computer or smart phone  this generates a passcode which can be used 
for two factor authentication (SCA)
Once downloaded, customers can set up the authenticator app through their PayPal 
security settings.
If the customer doesnt have a confirmed phone number on file, or the phone number 
is not valid (e.g. they no longer possess the phone, it is a landline or is untrusted) the 
customer must contact customer service for support.
Existing customers who only have a landline telephone number have been able to 
complete SCA by receiving an automated call and, when prompted, entering a code 
displayed on the PayPal screen into the telephones keypad, but currently there is 
an issue with the service.
The issue with the landline telephone option is a priority for PayPal but they, do not 
have a clear time frame for when this will be resolved.On the basis of this information I asked Mr O whether hed be comfortable with using an 
authenticator app. In response, Mr O let me know that he no longer wishes to resume his 
relationship with PayPal. He also said hed prefer any monetary award to go to charity.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I remain of the view that PayPal havent acted fairly and reasonably 
towards Mr O, and should remedy that. Ill explain why.
Ive found that PayPal didnt support Mr O well when they implemented SCA in 2020 and 
that, because of PayPals lack of support, Mr O reluctantly closed his account in 
understandable frustration. I also find that if PayPal had supported him as I think they should 
have done, hed more likely than not have kept his PayPal account open and I dont think 
hed have needed a mobile phone to do so. PayPal told us that they did offer the option to 
use a landline phone number or a third party authenticator app to complete SCA to those 
existing customers that did not have the possibility to add a mobile phone number to their 
account. But the problem here is that they evidently didnt offer that to Mr O. So, I remain of 
the view that the level of service they gave him was below what Id expect.
As someone who chooses not to own a mobile phone because he lives in an area of poor 
mobile reception, I think Mr Os circumstances are specifically covered in the FCAs 
guidance on the implementation of SCA. That guidance, which I referenced in my provisional 
decision, says PSPs must provide a viable means for customers who dont own mobile 
phones to complete SCA. PayPal havent given me any persuasive reason why that 
guidance shouldnt apply to Mr Os case.
PayPal have explained that their system for completing SCA by landline is currently 
experiencing some issues that theyre working on as a priority to resolve. So, it seems that 
offering Mr O the landline option wouldnt be something they can do right now. But I note 
they do have another, non-mobile phone option, for completing SCA; a third-party 
authenticator app downloaded to a phone or desktop. This is something I think PayPal 
could offer Mr O whilst theyre working towards resolving the issues with the landline option.
However, Mr O has now let me know that he no longer wants to have a PayPal account. 
Hes found other ways to make payments online, and doesnt want to be PayPals customer 
because of his poor experience of their service. So, although I would have directed PayPal 
to put Mr O back in the position of having a PayPal account with the option to complete SCA 
when its required without reliance on a mobile phone, I dont think I now need to make any 
direction about what authentication options PayPal should offer him going forwards.
Putting things right - what PayPal needs to do
Ways of strongly authenticating customers which dont rely on the payment service user 
having a mobile phone or mobile device do exist and the relevant guidance says alternatives 
should be offered. So, I think it was unfair and unreasonable of PayPal not to offer Mr O a 
viable alternative for completing SCA. To compensate him for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by this poor service I direct PayPal to pay Mr O £100.
Mr O can, of course, choose to donate that money to a charity if he so wishes.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Os complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should 
put things right in the way Ive set out in the Putting things right  what PayPal needs to do 
section of this decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
