Complaint
Miss M is unhappy because National Westminster Plc (NatWest) did not carry out sufficient 
enquiries to establish if she could afford to repay a loan.
What happened
Miss M took out a loan with NatWest to repay an existing loan with NatWest and to repay an 
existing loan held elsewhere. She also transferred money to an account held with a different 
bank.
Miss M complained that there was a lack of affordability checks and that the interest rate 
charged was too high.
NatWest said that they had carried out appropriate and proportionate affordability checks. It 
also said that the interest rate applied to the loan had undergone the appropriate 
underwriting criteria. 
My decision
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
DRN-1166446Before a bank can lend money it must take steps to ensure you a lender can afford to pay it 
back. Responsible banks usually ask some questions about the applicants income and 
his/her regular household expenses. Responsible banks can use this information and details 
about other debts from the applicants credit file. Banks should also take steps to check 
affordability if the applicant is wanting to extend or refinance existing loans.
Our investigator noted that NatWest was aware of Miss Ms income, employment status, 
creditworthiness and credit score. NatWest was also aware of Miss Ms mortgage 
repayments. Our investigator found that enough checks had been carried out prior to 
NatWest agreeing to make the loan. Our investigator was also satisfied that NatWest had 
applied the correct interest rate.
 
At the time of making this application to NatWest, Miss M also had a number of other loans, 
including a car loan.  The present loan was offered on a non-advised basis. 
 
As part of the application process for the present loan, NatWest conducted a credit search. 
At the time of her application Miss M had a good annual salary. At that time she had not 
missed any repayments of her NatWest loan. She was not in arrears and had been sending 
sufficient funds to cover the repayment of her NatWest loan. NatWest was also aware that 
Miss M had mortgage commitments and a car loan. Natwest considered the conduct of the 
accounts she held with it which gave no obvious signs that the loan would be unaffordable. . 
I conclude that NatWest took reasonable steps to ensure that Miss M could afford the 
repayments on the loan.
 
Miss M has told us about her mental health problems and the impact they have had on her 
financial situation. But I have to be fair to NatWest here too and I cant see that it could have 
been aware of these at the time she took out the loan. She hadnt told it about her mental 
health problems then I dont think it could have known about this from the manner she 
operated her accounts. 
 
Miss M also complained about the level of interest applied to her NatWest loan (20.4%). 
However the interest rate applied by NatWest is around 10% lower than the permitted rate. 
The rate charged (18.8%) is also lower than the rate of interest on her previous NatWest 
loan. The monthly repayments were lower that the repayments for the previous loan. At the 
time of her application Miss M was aware that this was the rate to be charged. .NatWest also 
provided Miss M with information in regard to debt management.  
 
NatWest took reasonable steps to ensure that the present loan was affordable to Miss M. 
They took account of her character, personal circumstances and her previous history of 
repayment of her loans. They took account of Miss Ms financial circumstances including her 
income and outgoings. They obtained a credit search and provided her with information 
regarding debt management. I conclude that they acted in a fair and reasonable manner 
when they were considering the application. I also find that the interest rate charged by 
NatWest is reasonable in all the circumstances. As indicated the rate applied was 10% 
below the permitted rate and lower than the rate applied to the previous loan. My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
