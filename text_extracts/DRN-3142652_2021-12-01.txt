The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc, unfairly declined his application to port 
his mortgage.
What happened
Mr S took out a mortgage with NatWest in October 2017. The mortgage was on a capital and 
repayment basis over a term of 21 years. The mortgage had a fixed rate of interest for five 
years. And if the mortgage was repaid within that five-year period an early repayment charge 
(ERC) would apply.
In 2020, Mr S was looking to move home. He applied for a new mortgage with NatWest on 
different terms, including borrowing more money. But as part of the application he wanted to 
port his existing mortgage. 
NatWest declined the application, including the request to port Mr S existing mortgage as it 
said it didnt meet its lending criteria around affordability.
Mr S obtained a new mortgage from a different lender and paid off his NatWest mortgage in 
July 2020. As a result, he incurred an ERC.
Mr S complained to NatWest about its decision to decline his application. He didnt think this 
was fair as he felt he had sufficient evidence of his income and available reserves to show 
that the mortgage was affordable. So, he was unhappy at having incurred the ERC. He also 
said he felt his original mortgage, taken in 2017, had been mis-sold as hed been told it was 
portable, a feature he required, but this had proven not to be the case.
NatWest said it didnt think it had done anything wrong. So, the complaint was referred to our 
service.
One of our Investigators looked into matters but didnt think NatWest had done anything 
wrong. He thought NatWest was entitled to decline the application on affordability grounds, 
as it involved additional borrowing and didnt meet its lending criteria at the time. And he felt 
the ERC had been charged correctly in line with the existing mortgage agreement. He also 
didnt feel the porting application being declined meant that the original mortgage was mis-
sold.
Mr S did not agree. He thought NatWest shouldve done more when considering his financial 
position as he holds his business accounts with it. And he felt it shouldve done more to 
explain what it could lend him. Mr S also still believed that the original mortgage had been 
mis-sold so asked for his complaint to be reviewed again. As a result, it has been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S has said that because he was not able to port his existing mortgage, he believes it was 
mis-sold to him in 2017. He says this is because NatWest was aware, when it agreed to the 
mortgage in 2017, that he would likely be moving within the fixed rate period. 
But I dont agree, based on the information Ive seen, that this means the mortgage agreed 
in 2017 was mis-sold. The mortgage agreement from 2017 confirms it could be ported under 
certain circumstances. The mortgage offer includes a section called What happens if you 
move house? And this explains;
You have the possibility, during the period in which an early repayment charge is payable to 
port your existing mortgage product(s) to your new property subject to the following terms:-
Your new application must meet our lending criteria current at the time you move
And I think the fact the mortgage was portable is further demonstrated by NatWest 
considering Mr S application. So, Im satisfied the mortgage Mr S took in 2017 was portable, 
as NatWest explained to him at the time.
Mr S didnt meet the lending criteria in place at the time he asked to port the mortgage and 
borrow additional funds. But that is not the same as the mortgage not in fact being portable. 
Rather it is a matter of the later application to port being declined. So, I dont agree that 
NatWests decision to decline Mr S new mortgage application in 2020, which included 
porting his existing mortgage, means that his existing mortgage was mis-sold.
Mr S has said he does not think NatWest fairly declined his application and disputes its 
reasoning, that it was not affordable. And he has referenced that another lender was willing 
to lend, based on the same information.
Lenders have different lending criteria. And a different lender agreeing to a mortgage does 
not mean that NatWest made an error when declining Mr S application.
NatWest is entitled to decide whether or not it is willing to lend and set its own lending 
criteria  including around affordability and what information it is willing to accept and rely on 
in relation to this. NatWest has provided its underwriting notes which explain that, based on 
the information available to it when Mr S applied for his new mortgage in 2020, including 
porting his existing one, the application did not meet its lending criteria at the time. And this 
was primarily based on the evidence of Mr S income. I know Mr S thinks that the mortgage 
was affordable to him. But Im satisfied, based on the information available that the 
application didnt meet NatWests lending criteria around this, at the time it was made. I 
havent seen anything that leads me to think NatWest has applied its lending criteria unfairly 
here. And I dont think there were any grounds for it not to apply its usual assessment of 
affordability, in line with those criteria.
So, while I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr S, I dont think NatWest has acted 
unfairly by declining his mortgage application in 2020. 
Mr S has said that NatWest shouldve done more, such as discussing what it would agree to 
lend, so that he couldve avoided paying an ERC. But I dont agree. NatWest was asked to 
consider a mortgage application. Which it declined and explained why. Mr S was able to 
approach NatWest for lending under revised terms. But I think it was reasonable for NatWest 
to assume, when it declined the application and Mr S redeemed his mortgage, that hed 
chosen to go elsewhere because it was unable to provide the mortgage he needed. I dont 
think it was obliged to make any counter proposal, as part of Mr S application.When Mr S redeemed his mortgage in July 2020, NatWest charged an ERC. From the 
information Ive seen this was applied in line with the mortgage agreement from 2017. And 
as I dont think NatWest has made an error when dealing with Mr S new mortgage 
application, I cant reasonably require NatWest to refund that charge.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2021.
