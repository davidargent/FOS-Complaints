The complaint
Ms M complains that NewDay Ltd irresponsibly allowed her to open two credit card accounts 
which were unaffordable.
What happened
Ms M says she opened two NewDay credit card accounts in 2020. She says the lending was 
unaffordable and NewDay didnt carry out any checks on her applications. Ms M says she 
was in financial difficulties and says NewDay has recorded her income incorrectly. She 
would like the interest and charges refunded and the amount she owes written off.
NewDay says it carried out appropriate checks on both applications. It says the first account 
was opened in July 2020 with a £600 credit limit, and Ms M told it she earned £35,000 a year 
and had debts of just over £2,000. NewDay says the second account was opened in 
November 2020 and Ms M gave it similar information as well as telling it there was additional 
household income of just under £2,000 a month. The credit limit was £700 on this account 
and NewDay says it offered Ms M help when she told it about her financial difficulties but 
says there was no adverse information on her credit file.
Ms M brought her complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it and thought NewDay 
carried out appropriate checks. The investigator thought Ms M told NewDay what her income 
was, and it was her responsibility to provide accurate information. The investigator thought 
Ms M had managed her existing credit appropriately and there wasnt any adverse 
information that NewDay ought to have considered.
Ms M doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Ms M will be disappointed by my decision.
Lenders and credit providers should carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any 
application for credit and borrowing. Those checks will of course vary depending on the type 
of lending and the amount involved. I am looking at a credit facility here rather than for 
example a loan.
I can see that Ms M applied for both accounts and would have been responsible for 
providing NewDay with her income details. I can see that she told NewDay she was earning 
£35,000 a year and there was additional household income of £2,000 a month. I have looked 
at NewDays records and can see that it carried out checks on the applications and 
calculated Ms Ms debts at between £2,000 and £4,200. So, Im satisfied NewDay carried 
out proportionate and reasonable checks on both applications and was entitled to consider 
that Ms M didnt have any adverse information on her credit file such as defaults or missed 
payments. It follows that I dont think NewDay acted irresponsibly or that the lending was 
unaffordable at the time of the lending.
I have looked at Ms Ms account statements from the first account and can see that she 
made appropriate repayments for some time after the account was opened which I think 
provides further evidence NewDays lending decision wasnt irresponsible.
Overall, I find NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks on both credit card 
applications and that the lending decisions were affordable. Im also satisfied that NewDay 
approved both accounts with relatively modest credit limits and tried to help Ms M when she 
told it about her financial difficulties. For those reasons I cant fairly order NewDay to refund 
any charges or interest and I make it clear to Ms M that I wouldnt have ordered the debt to 
be written off, even if I thought the lending unaffordable, as she had the benefit of the 
money.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2021.
