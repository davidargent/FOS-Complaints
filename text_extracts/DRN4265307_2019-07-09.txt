K821x#15complaint
Ms W says Casheuronet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly  lent to her.
background
I sent my provisional decision on 18 June  2019. A copy  of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background of this complaint. It explains why I was 
planning to uphold Ms Ws complaint about  loans 2 and 3, and loans 7 to 21 inclusive. I 
said Id consider anything else anyone wanted  to send me, but both sides confirmed they 
had nothing more  to add.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has any new evidence  or arguments.  So having reconsidered the case, Ive 
come to the same conclusion as before  that I partially uphold  the complaint, and that 
Casheuronet should put things right. 
putting things right  what Casheuronet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans  2 and 3, and loans 7 to 21 
inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 and 3 from Ms Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 21 inclusive should be 
removed from Ms Ws credit file.
If Ms W still owes Casheuronet any of the principal balance  she borrowed on her final 
loan, Casheuronet  may deduct  this from the compensation that is due to her. But to 
be clear,  that outstanding  balance  should  be recalculated to remove any interest and 
charges, but taking  account of any repayments Ms W has made on that loan as 
though they were  applied against  the principal sum borrowed.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Casheuronet to take off tax from this interest. 
Casheuronet must give Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN42653072my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, I partially uphold 
Ms Ws complaint about Casheuronet UK LLC, and direct Casheuronet UK LLC to put things 
right in the way I set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 August 2019.

complaint
Ms W says Casheuronet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
Casheuronet gave Ms W 20 payday  loans, followed by a similar flexible short-term  loan, which 
Casheuronet provided to Ms W between February 2012 and August 2014.
Casheuronet says Ms Ws complaint about  loan 1 was made too late. As a result,  Ms W has said she 
no longer wishes to complaint about that loan.  Casheuronet  did agree  that it should  not have lent loan 
2, and offered  to refund  the interest  it had charged.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ws complaint and thought  the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Casheuronet disagreed,  and instead offered compensation relating to 
loans 14 to 21. The complaint has been passed to me to decide.

my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Ref: DRN42653074Casheuronet needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Ms W could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Casheuronet should  fairly and reasonably have done  
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Casheuronet  was required to establish whether 
Ms W could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending defines sustainable as being 
without undue  difficulties and in particular  the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting other reasonable  commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably  to realise, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Ws complaint.
Casheuronet says Ms Ws complaint about  loan 1 was made too late. As a result,  Ms W has said she 
no longer wishes to complaint about that loan.  And Casheuronet has already agreed that it should  not 
have lent Ms W loan 2, and has offered to refund the interest it charged.  So Ive not considered 
whether loans  1 or 2 shouldve been  lent here.
Based on what Ive seen so far, I dont  think that Casheuronet  shouldve lent loan 3 to Ms W. The 
repayment for loan 3 made up the vast majority of Ms Ws income,  leaving her with very little to pay all 
her other  living costs,  so I dont think it was sustainably affordable. And I think  this wouldve been 
clear from a proportionate check, or even a very basic check. Indeed, it showed on the check  
Casheuronet did, so it was aware  of how much loan 3s repayment was relative to Ms Ws income. So 
Casheuronet should have known that it was unlikely  that loan 3 would  be sustainably affordable for 
her.
With that said, I havent  seen  enough to make  me think loans  4 to 6 were lent unfairly.  For example,  
they were for significantly lower amounts than loan 3, were  taken out after a somewhat longer gap in 
time after loan 3 ended, and at that point  Ms W didnt have  a history of any missed  or late payments.
Ref: DRN42653075Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Casheuronets  lending history with Ms W, with a view to 
seeing if there  was a point at which  Casheuronet should  reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Casheuronet  should have realised  that it shouldnt  
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ws case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because:
By the time Ms W asked for loan 7, shed been borrowing from Casheuronet  for a lengthy 
period and she wasnt making  any real inroads to the amount she owed Casheuronet. Loan 7 
was taken  out seven months after Ms Ws first, without any significant  gaps in time between  
each loan, and it was for a much larger  amount. By then,  Ms W had paid large amounts of 
interest to Casheuronet to effectively service  a debt over an extended period.
Although there  were gaps of around two months between loans 3 and 4, and between  loans 9 
and 10, I dont  think  these were  significant enough for Casheuronet  to have reasonably 
concluded that Ms Ws finances had moved on from whatever situation had required her 
previous loans, or that she was no longer reliant  on the borrowing. The amounts she was 
borrowing did not consistently or sustainably  reduce:  they fluctuated by quite a bit, and on 
average increased over time.
From loan 7 onwards,  Ms W was borrowing regularly and consistently from Casheuronet, So 
Casheuronet ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Ms W was having  to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances,  and that 
Ms Ws indebtedness was continuing unsustainably.
I think  that Ms W lost out because  Casheuronet continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Ms Ws indebtedness  by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  and top-ups  was likely to have had negative implications on 
Ms Ws ability to access  mainstream  credit, and so kept her in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans.
So like our adjudicator, Im also planning to uphold  the complaint about loans 7 to 21 in addition to 
loans 2 and 3, and I propose that Casheuronet puts things right.
putting things  right  what I think  Casheuronet should do
refund all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans  2 and 3, and loans 7 to 21 inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans  2 and 3 from Ms Ws credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 21 inclusive  should be removed from Ms Ws credit 
file.
If Ms W still owes Casheuronet any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan, 
Casheuronet may deduct this from the compensation that is due to her. But to be clear, that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, but taking 
account of any repayments Ms W has made on that loan as though they were applied against 
the principal sum borrowed.
Ref: DRN42653076 HM Revenue & Customs requires Casheuronet to take off tax from this interest. Casheuronet must  
give Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  I gave  above, I plan to partially uphold Ms Ws complaint, and to direct Casheuronet  
UK LLC to put things  right in the way I set out above.
Please could  Casheuronet  and Ms W send me any more information or comments to look at by 18 
July 2019. After that, Ill reconsider the case.
