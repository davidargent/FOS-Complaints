K820x#14complaint
Mr B has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  
MYJAR Limited (MYJAR). 
Mr B says MYJAR  lent to him irresponsibly because he had numerous  other  loans 
outstanding at the time and he had defaulted  on other financial products he already had. He 
says this meant that the MYJAR  loans he was given were unaffordable and they caused 
him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr B took 2 loans from MYJAR,  in February and May 2018. Its worth 
noting that the terms were as follows:
loan 1 (£250)  required repayments  to be made in 3 instalments; and  
loan 2 (£350)  required 6 instalments.
Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Bs borrowing with MYJAR, based on the information it 
provided to us which can be found in an appendix  at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they didnt think  it should be 
upheld. Mr B didnt agree  with the adjudicator and asked for an ombudsmans  final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Bs 
complaint.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr B could repay both the loans he was given  in a sustainable manner. These checks ought  
to have taken  into account a range of different  factors,  such as the amounts being lent, the 
total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
MYJAR should have  fairly and reasonably done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ref: DRN95544172the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Ive carefully  considered all of these things 
and what they mean  for Mr Bs complaint.
MYJAR told us it carried out certain checks before agreeing to lend to Mr B, including 
assessing his income,  expenditure, net disposable  income and a credit  check.  It says that 
based on what he said, this information showed that Mr B would be able to make  the loan 
repayments he was committing  to on both occasions. 
For the first loan, in February 2018, Mr B declared his net income (after tax) as £2,300  per 
month and he also provided details about his expenditure. Having carefully considered his 
situation, I think the repayments on this loan would have appeared to have been affordable  
for Mr B and I note he was able to repay this loan quite quickly. For the second loan, he 
declared his net income to be £2,200 and once again I think the repayments and his other 
expenditure would have  appeared affordable.
So I think it was reasonable in this case for MYJAR to have relied on this information to 
decide about whether to lend to Mr B on both occasions, bearing in mind  what Ive said 
about the early  stages  of a lending relationship. Both the first and second loans were  
relatively small when set against what Mr B said he earned, and his other monthly 
commitments. For the second loan in particular,  information was available  about Mr Bs brief 
repayment history. 
I accept that Mr Bs actual  financial position  might well have been more  apparent  if further 
information, such as full bank statements or more detailed credit  checks, had been  obtained  
at these stages. But MYJAR made its decision based on the information it had available  at 
the time and as it was still in the early stages of a lending relationship with Mr B I dont think  
it had yet reached the stage where there was a greater risk of either loans being 
unsustainable for him. 
I looked in detail at the other  financial products Mr B said hed had with other providers and 
also at the credit report he himself says he obtained. However, I dont think MYJAR would 
have seen this type of information when it lent him the monies and I dont think  it acted 
unreasonably given the amount of lending Mr B asked for, or the time frame over which the 
loan applications  were made.
So in the particular circumstances of this case, I dont think it was irresponsible for MYJAR  
to lend Mr B either of loans 1 or 2.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. And I dont  direct  MYJAR 
Limited to pay Mr B any compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.
