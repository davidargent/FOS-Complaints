Mr H says Ferratum  didnt  carry out enough affordability checks before lending him the 
money and this caused his debts to spiral.  He says he was allowed to defer, rollover  and 
increase his borrowing and was using  multiple  short-term lenders at the same time. Mr H 
adds that he has mental  health difficulties and the loans should not have been provided to 
him while in a vulnerable position.
Ferratum says it asked Mr H for his income  and carried out a credit check. It says it cannot  
agree the money was lent irresponsibly but, as a gesture of goodwill, it offered to write off 
the balance on Mr Hs final loan and refund him £500.
Ref: DRN36380272Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She said that by loan 6, 
Mr Hs pattern of borrowing should  have indicated  that repayments  on further loans were likely 
to be unsustainable.  She said Ferratum should refund interest and charges on loans 6 to 31 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and it should remove  those loans from Mr Hs credit file.
Ferratum responded  to say, in summary,  that it partially agreed with the recommendations 
and offered to uphold  loans between 2017  and 2019.
Mr H did not accept this offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ferratum needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Ferratum  should fairly and reasonably have  done  
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Ferratum was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN36380273Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Loans 1 to 3
Ive seen the credit checks carried out by Ferratum at the time of the first three loan 
applications and, based on the available information, I cant  conclude  it was wrong to 
approve the loans.
Loans 4 and 5
When Mr H applied for these loans, I consider Ferratum should have carried  out better 
checks, including a review of his financial circumstances and his situation with regard to 
other short-term loans. Based on the evidence  Ive seen, Im not satisfied Ferratum  carried 
out such checks so Ive had a look to see what such checks  are likely to have  shown.
From looking  at Mr Hs bank statements,  I cant see that his regular expenditure exceeded 
his income at the time and he didnt  appear to be reliant  on short-term lending.  So I think its 
likely that Ferratum would still have found  loans  4 and 5 to be affordable  even if it had 
carried out proportionate checks.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ferratums lending history  with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Ferratum should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Ferratum should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 6. 
I say this because:
By loan 6 Mr H had been borrowing from Ferratum for seven months with few gaps  
between loans;
As this was his sixth loan in quick succession, I consider this should have been an 
indication to Ferratum  that Mr H wasnt using the loans to address short-term cashflow 
issues which is the purpose of such high-cost lending;
Mr Hs borrowing requirements  werent reducing;
From loan 6 onwards Mr H was provided with a new loan within  days/weeks  of settling a 
previous one. So Ferratum ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Ferratum. Loan 31 was 
taken out three-and-a-half years  after Mr Hs first. And it was for four times the amount. 
Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Ferratum over an 
extended period.
Ref: DRN36380274I think that Mr H lost out because Ferratum  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability  
to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 31 and Ferratum  should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Ferratum UK Ltd should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr H paid on loans 6 to 31;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Deduct from this amount  any refunds  already paid;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges for loan 31, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr H;
The number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards  means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  6 to 31 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Ferratum  to take off tax from this interest. Ferratum must  
give Mr H a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Ferratum 
intends to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 March 2020.
