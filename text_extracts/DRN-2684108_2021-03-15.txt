The complaint
Mr M complains about the way TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED trading as
TransUnion Information Group (TransUnion) handled a request to correct information on his
credit file.  
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision last month. In my provisional decision I said: 
What happened
Mr M found that the date of birth noted on a credit file entry relating to a closed credit
commitment was wrong and, in October 2019, contacted TransUnion. Mr M has told us he
had also contacted the business involved and arranged for his date of birth to be corrected.
Mr M emailed TransUnion again on 21 November 2020 and was told the date of birth would
update.
On 7 January 2020, after allowing several weeks for his credit file to update, Mr M contacted
TransUnion again as the date of birth was still wrong. On 7 January 2020 TransUnion told
Mr M it was making arrangements to amend his credit file. Mr M followed up with TransUnion
on 16 January 2020 and was told it could contact the reporting business on his behalf and
asked for his details. Mr M explained he had already provided TransUnion with the
information it asked for, but responded as requested.
TransUnion emailed Mr M on 14 February 2020 and said the amendments had been made.
But the date of birth used by TransUnion was still wrong. After Mr M pointed out the error
remained TransUnion responded to say it was unable to amend his date of birth.
Mr M complained again and said hed been given unclear and misleading information. On
20 March 2020 TransUnion issued a final response and upheld Mr Ms complaint.
TransUnion confirmed the date of birth was corrected and that administrative errors had
affected the resolution of the dispute Mr M brought.
Mr M referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. Mr M
explained he thought compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the way TransUnion
had handled his dispute was reasonable. Mr M noted it had taken over four months to get his
credit file corrected.
The investigator agreed that TransUnion had made mistakes but thought its apology in the
final response was a fair way to resolve the matter. The investigator also said TransUnion
wasnt responsible for the mistake with Mr Ms date of birth. Mr M asked to appeal so his
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached a different view of Mr Ms complaint to the investigator. I understand that
TransUnion wasnt responsible for the error in the way Mr Ms date of birth was reported. But
I think the way it handled Mr Ms dispute was somewhat confused with contradictory
information being provided. And, as TransUnion has confirmed, administrative errors
impacted how long it took to correct Mr Ms credit file. Mr M says he feels a modest level of
compensation to reflect how his dispute was handled would be a fair way to resolve his
complaint, in addition to TransUnions apology. I think thats a reasonable view.
Looking at Mr Ms correspondence with TransUnion, I can see he received varying
responses and information when he raised the date of birth issue. Mr M was first referred
back to the reporting business so it could correct the error. Mr M complied and in November
2019 contacted TransUnion to check whether a date of birth would change on a closed
credit commitment.
From that point, TransUnion gave differing responses as to why the date of birth hadnt
changed. At various points TransUnion said the error had either been corrected or that it
couldnt amend Mr Ms data. A good example of this varying response came when
TransUnion incorrectly advised Mr M the error with his date of birth had been amended on
14 February 2020. But after Mr M responded, TransUnion sent another email on 18
February 2020 saying it couldnt make any changes to a date of birth.
Whilst I understand the underlying error was not caused by TransUnion, I can see how
frustrated Mr M became at the differing advice and information he received from TransUnion.
And I agree with Mr M that the information he received was confusing at times and unclear.
I also think its reasonable to note that TransUnion agrees errors it made meant the process
of correcting Mr Ms credit file took longer than it should have. I think that Mr Ms growing
frustration reflects the length of time it took for the issue to be resolved. Based on the
information Ive seen so far, I intend to direct TransUnion to pay Mr M £100 in recognition of
the distress and inconvenience caused by the way it handled his request.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I asked Mr M and TransUnion to respond with any new points or information they wanted me 
to consider before I made my final decision. Mr M responded and confirmed he was happy 
with my provisional decision. We didnt hear back from TransUnion. 
As neither party has provided new information for me to consider, I see no reason to change 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Mr Ms complaint should be 
upheld, for the same reasons. 
Final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK 
LIMITED trading as TransUnion Information Group to pay Mr M £100 to reflect the distress 
and inconvenience caused.   Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2021.
