DRN-1748025
 
The complaint
 Mr and Mrs S complain that Santander UK Plc mis-sold them a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy.
Background
I issued my provisional decision on 12 March 2020. A copy of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision set out the background to this complaint. It explained why I didnt 
think that Mr and Mrs S complaint should be upheld.
Neither Santander nor Mr and Mrs S responded to my provisional decision with any further 
comments or information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Santander nor Mr and Mrs S have provided me with any further comments or 
information following my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the conclusion I 
reached in it. 
So I still dont think the complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I dont uphold this complaint 
against Santander UK Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S and Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
