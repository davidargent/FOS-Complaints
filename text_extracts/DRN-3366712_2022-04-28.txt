The complaint
Mrs O complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland plc wont refund to her the money that she 
paid for some holiday club points. Mrs O is being represented in her complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mrs O and her husband had bought a fixed week membership from a timeshare company 
and they agreed to trade that timeshare for some holiday club points in October 2013 under 
a purchase agreement. They also agreed to pay £4,600 to the holiday company. £1,150 of 
that was paid using Mrs Os RBS credit card and the remaining £3,450 was to be paid under 
a deferred payment agreement with the timeshare company. 
Mrs Os representative complained to RBS that the timeshare company had misrepresented 
the product to Mrs O and her husband and that it had breached its contract with them. RBS 
said that it had reviewed the documents provided but no breach of contract or 
misrepresentation had been proved and that it had been unable to establish the debtor-
creditor-supplier relationship required for a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974. Mrs O wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
there was sufficient information to conclude that there was a debtor-creditor-supplier link but 
he didnt think that RBS had acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold Mrs Os claim 
under section 75. Mrs Os representative has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
one of those circumstances is that there must be a relevant relationship between the 
debtor, the creditor and the supplier  our investigator has described in detail why he 
considered that such a relationship was present and I consider it to be more likely 
than not that there was a relevant relationship between the debtor, the creditor and 
the supplier in these arrangements;
to be able to uphold Mrs Os complaint about RBS, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare company and that 
RBSs s response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mrs Os claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
Mrs Os representative says that Mrs O and her husband traded in their timeshare 
and paid £4,600 for some holiday club points to exit the timeshare that was in 
perpetuity, that they would continue to pay maintenance fees for ten years and that 
they would then be able to walk away without any further liability;
her representative says that they were told that this was the only way that they could 
exit the timeshare membership  but timeshares in perpetuity are illegal in that 
jurisdiction, that the accommodation isnt specified in the purchase agreement and 
theres no guarantee that they can walk away after ten years;
the purchase agreement says that Mrs O and her husband were paying £4,600 and 
trading in their fixed week timeshare and were acquiring 28,500 membership points;
the arrangements under which they could use those points and the duration of the 
points wasnt set out in the purchase agreement but this service has seen in other 
contracts with the timeshare company that the buyer would usually be sent a 
separate letter at the time of sale confirming that theyd be able to surrender their 
membership points at no further cost after a specified number of years but they had 
to continue to pay the maintenance fees until that time;
theres no written record of what was discussed between the timeshare company and 
Mrs O and her husband before the purchase agreement was entered into but I 
consider it to be more likely than not that it was Mrs O and her husbands 
understanding that their liability for the timeshare would end after ten years;
they entered into the purchase agreement in October 2013 so that ten year period 
wont end until October 2023 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that they were told that this was the only way that they would be able to exit 
their timeshare or that they were induced into entering into the purchase agreement 
by misrepresentations made by the timeshare company;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the membership points werent available for 
Mrs O and her husband to use and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of contract by the timeshare company;
I sympathise with Mrs O and her husband for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and their concerns about the purchase agreement, but Im not persuaded 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare 
company; and
I consider that RBSs response to Mrs Os section 75 claim was fair and reasonable 
and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require RBS to refund to Mrs O any of the money that she and her husband paid 
under the purchase agreement, to pay Mrs O any other compensation or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
