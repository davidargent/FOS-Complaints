The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C entered into a purchase agreement to buy some holiday club membership 
points in July 2016. The price payable was £8,260 and they entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that amount. They agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £121.76 to Shawbrook Bank. 
Mr and Mrs Cs representative made claims to Shawbrook Bank under sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in May 2017. It said that the holiday company didnt 
conduct a proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Cs financial position and ability to repay the 
loan, breached EU Law, misrepresented the membership to Mr and Mrs C, breached the 
contract and applied undue pressure to them to procure their agreement to the loan. It also 
said that Shawbrook Bank had paid an undisclosed commission to the holiday company and 
that the relationship between Mr and Mrs C and Shawbrook Bank was unfair. 
Shawbrook Bank issued a detailed response to those claims and set out the reasons that it 
didnt consider that Mr and Mrs Cs claims should be upheld. It described the five purchases 
of points that theyd made from the holiday company between September 2002 and July 
2016 and said that it didnt agree that the loan was mis-sold to them. Mr and Mrs C werent 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld as she didnt think 
that Shawbrook Banks decision to turn down their section 75 and 140A claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation that played an 
important part in Mr and Mrs Cs decision to purchase the membership points. She said that 
she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs C and 
Shawbrook Bank was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She didnt consider that Shawbrook Bank had 
acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendations are manifestly wrong 
and has described in detail what it says are breaches of applicable regulations, including the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and the 
Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Cs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Cs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Shawbrook Bank has described the five purchases of membership points that Mr and 
Mrs C made from the holiday company between September 2002 and July 2016;
in July 2016 they signed documents including the purchase agreement, the terms 
and conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice, a key information 
document, the holiday companys customer compliance statement, a credit 
application, the loan agreement and Shawbrook Banks customer compliance 
statement;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative has described the way that it says that the 
membership was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs C in July 2016 including that they 
were told that they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would 
cover the maintenance fees and provide a profit and that they were offered the 
opportunity to purchase more points in a specified collection;
the holiday companys compliance statement that they signed says: We understand 
that this document, the Purchase Agreement and the documents referred to in it form 
the entire agreement between the parties We confirm that no oral or written 
representations have been made to us upon which we have relied and which are 
either not contained in the documentation presented to us today or noted by us below 
in the comments box;
that statement also included two paragraphs about rentals and resales and included 
the following: there is no guarantee that the week will be rented out;
Ive seen nothing in the documents that Mr and Mrs C signed to show that they would 
receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would cover the maintenance fees 
and provide a profit or that they would be able to purchase more points in a specified 
collection - and if theyd been told that they would receive a guaranteed rental 
income or be offered those points I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have checked that those provisions were contained in the documents before 
they signed them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs C or that they were induced into entering into the 
purchase agreement by any misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative has described what it says is a breach of contract 
because the notices of the general meetings of the holiday company werent sent to 
Mr and Mrs C in accordance with the companys articles of association;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the holiday companys articles of association, but even if there had been a breach 
of those articles in the way claimed by Mr and Mrs Cs representative, I dont consider that that would be a breach of contract by the holiday company for which 
Shawbrook Bank would be liable under section 75 in these circumstances;
Ive carefully considered Mr and Mrs Cs representatives response to our 
investigators recommendations, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts 
Regulations 1999 or any other applicable EU law or regulation for which Shawbrook 
Bank would be liable in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr and Mrs Cs financial position and ability to repay the loan but 
Shawbrook Bank has provided a copy of the credit application that was made by Mr 
and Mrs C in which they declared a joint annual income of £46,000 and I consider 
that it was reasonable for Shawbrook Bank to conclude, on the basis of the 
information that theyd provided, that they could afford a loan with monthly 
repayments of £121.76;
Mr and Mrs C signed Shawbrook Banks customer compliance statement in which 
they said: We are confident that from an income perspective that the repayments 
shall be met now and in the future and Shawbrook has provided an account 
statement which shows that Mr and Mrs C have continued to make the monthly 
repayments and that there are no arrears on the account;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan that was made to Mr and Mrs C in July 
2016 wasnt affordable for them;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that the holiday company applied undue 
pressure to Mr and Mrs C to procure their agreement to the loan - but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unduly pressurised 
into entering into the purchase agreement or loan agreement in July 2016 or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
the holiday companys compliance statement that Mr and Mrs C signed says: We 
confirm that we have been treated courteously during the sales presentation, that we 
have been given plenty of time to consider if the product is right for us and we have 
not been put under any pressure to purchase our Points;
Mr and Mrs C had the right to withdraw from the agreements in the first 14 days and 
theyd signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that they could give - 
if they were concerned about the way that those agreements were sold to them, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have withdrawn from them 
within the withdrawal period but Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted 
the holiday company or Shawbrook Bank about withdrawing from the agreements 
within that period;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that Shawbrook Bank paid an undisclosed 
commission to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive not been 
provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Shawbrook Bank to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Shawbrook Bank 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Shawbrook 
Bank should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and Mrs C 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Cs 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs C 
and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances;
I consider that Shawbrook Bank responded to Mr and Mrs Cs claims fairly and 
reasonably and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with them; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs C for the issues that theyve have had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to them any of the money that theyve 
paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 April 2023.
