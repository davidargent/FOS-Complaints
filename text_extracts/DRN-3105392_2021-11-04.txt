The complaint
Mr M complains that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited has terminated the conditional sale 
agreement under which a car was supplied to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
he signed in May 2017. Moneybarn didnt receive the monthly payments that were due from 
Mr M from December 2017 to February 2018 so a default notice was issued to him. He didnt 
take the required action so his agreement was terminated, the car was repossessed and 
sold at auction, and his debt was passed to a third party. 
Mr M complained to Moneybarn but it didnt uphold his complaint. It said that payments 
hadnt been made by Mr M, efforts were made to contact him, it was unable to confirm 
receipt of the e-mails referred to by Mr M and he was afforded the opportunity to keep the 
car after his agreement had been terminated. Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He couldnt say that 
Moneybarn had acted unfairly or unreasonably by terminating the agreement as there was a 
history of missed payments and there was nothing to suggest that Mr M contacted it about 
his payments before the agreement was terminated. He considered that Mr M remains liable 
for the outstanding balance of his account.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
he moved abroad due to work commitments and informed Moneybarn of that to 
ensure any communication would be by email or phone;
he admits that he missed one payment but made it clear by email to Moneybarn that 
it would not happen again and instructed it to withdraw future payments from his new 
bank account; 
he sent emails to Moneybarn when his payments werent collected as he couldnt get 
through by phone and then spoke with it and was assured that the issue would be 
dealt with;
he received the notice of default which required him to pay additional fees and 
Moneybarn didnt accept his offer to clear the arrears; and
he made it clear to the third party that he would be happy to settle the arrears up to 
the point of cancellation of the agreement and no further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M signed the conditional sale agreement in May 2017 and agreed to make 59 
monthly payments of £167.19 for the car to be supplied to him;
he moved abroad and the payments that were due from him in December 2017 and 
January and February 2018 werent made  Moneybarns account notes show that it 
tried to contact Mr M about the missed payments but was unable to do so and that it 
then sent him a notice of default;
Mr M has provided a screenshot of an e-mail that he says he sent to Moneybarn in 
January 2018 in which he said that he was having financial difficulties and would start 
repayments the following month  but hed missed two payments at that time, 
Moneybarn says that it didnt receive that email and theres no record of any contact 
from Mr M in its account notes until March 2018, which was after his agreement had 
been terminated;
Mr M has provided a screenshot of an email that he says that he sent to Moneybarn 
in February 2018 in which he said: I have noticed that my monthly payment wasnt 
charged to my new bank account as instructed. I do not use the previous account as 
discussed over the phone  but Moneybarn has no record of Mr M changing the 
details of the direct debit for his monthly payment and it said in its final response 
letter to him that its inbound telephone reports had no record of a call from Mr M 
between May 2017 and December 2019;
I consider that the default notice was correctly issued to Mr M in February 2018, he 
accepts that he received it but he didnt contact Moneybarn in response to it and 
didnt take the action required by the default notice so I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable for Moneybarn to terminate his agreement;
Moneybarn received an email from Mr M in March 2018, after his agreement had 
been terminated, which said: Following my previous email explaining temporary 
financial difficulties, I am now on track to continue payment through Direct Debit as 
initially agreed on the second of each month. I apologize for any inconvenience;
it replied to him to say that his agreement had been terminated but he could keep the 
car if he settled the finance in full or by a consent order  but Mr M didnt settle the 
finance or agree to a consent order;
the car was repossessed and was sold at auction, and the sale proceeds were 
credited to Mr Ms account, which left a balance outstanding from him of £7,136.07;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Moneybarn has acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr M for the financial difficulties to which hes referred and the 
other difficulties that these events will have caused him but the car has been sold at 
auction so cant be returned to him and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to reinstate Mr Ms conditional sale 
agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Moneybarn has 
calculated the outstanding balance of Mr Ms account incorrectly and I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Moneybarn to reduce, or waive, the amount that is owed by Mr M, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint; and
I suggest that Mr M contacts Moneybarn to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that he owes  if he doesnt do so I consider it to be 
likely that further action will be taken against him, to the extent thats legally allowed, 
to recover the money from him  Mr M should explain any financial difficulties that 
hes experiencing to Moneybarn and its required to respond to any such difficulties 
positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
