The complaint
Mr Gs 
The complaint
Mr Gs complaint is that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has used the 
compensation from a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy to reduce the 
debt it says Mr G still owes following completion of an Individual Voluntary Arrangement 
(IVA). Mr G wants NatWest to pay the compensation directly to him.
What happened
Mr G entered into an IVA. My understanding is the IVA was completed in 2008.
NatWest was party to the IVA.
In 2020 Mr G complained to NatWest about a PPI policy he had been sold with a loan.
NatWest agreed to uphold the complaint and offered compensation which Mr G 
accepted. But NatWest used the compensation to reduce the debt it said was still owed 
by Mr G.
Mr G says that as the IVA has been completed, NatWest should pay the compensation 
directly to him.
Our adjudicator thought NatWest had acted fairly. Mr G disagreed with the adjudicators 
findings so the complaints been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint and Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the letter NatWest sent to Mr G in April 2020. I can see that on page one it 
sets out the offer of compensation. On page two the letter mentions that if Mr G had been 
party to an IVA any payment would be made to the relevant account and any 
disbursements would be managed by NatWests insolvency team.
And on the attached acceptance form it was again stated that if Mr G had been in an IVA 
then any payment will be made to the relevant account. So I think NatWests offer made it 
clear that it intended to use the compensation to offset any outstanding debt.
Mr G believes there is no outstanding debt as all the debt with NatWest was written off and 
does not exist following the completion of the IVA.
Ive thought about this but when Mr G entered into the IVA, the debts he owed werent 
cancelled. And they werent cancelled when he completed the IVA. Mr G couldnt be chased 
for the debts. However, the debt he had with NatWest still existed.
NatWest has shown us evidence that on completion of the IVA there remained a debt of 
Â£14,043.78 which originated from a current account overdraft and an outstanding loan. I 
think NatWest can fairly use the compensation to reduce this balance. In effect Mr G owes 
NatWest the outstanding debt from his current account and loan, and NatWest owes Mr G a 
smaller amount of compensation for mis-sold PPI policies. I dont think it would be fair for me 
to direct NatWest to pay Mr G the PPI compensation when Mr G still owes NatWest a larger 
amount. So I think its fair for NatWest to set one against the other.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2021.
