The complaint
Mr K complains that Advantage Insurance Company Limited mishandled a claim on his
motor insurance policy.
  
What happened
A car maker made a car in about 2010 and its first owner registered it in March 2010. In
2017, the car suffered damage and an insurance company treated it as a write-off. But it sold
the damaged vehicle, and someone repaired it.
Mr K has said he bought the car knowing of the previous write-off  and he has experience
in this area. He had the car since at least 2019.
For the year from 10 June 2020, he had the car insured on a policy under which Advantage
was responsible for dealing with claims. Where I refer to Advantage, I include claims-
handlers and others insofar as I hold Advantage responsible for their actions.
The policy said that  in the event of an accident - Advantage would either pay for repair of
the car or pay its pre-accident value. Any claim was subject to an excess of £770.00.
On about 20 August 2010, Mr Ks car left the road and sustained damage. After he made a
claim on his policy, Advantage decided his car was beyond repair  a total loss. Advantage
made an offer. Mr K complained to Advantage that it hadnt offered enough for the car.
On about 20 October 2020, Advantage paid Mr K £1,100.31. Its final response dated 28
October 2020 indicated that its offer had been as follows:
pre-accident value (if not previous write off) £2,600.50
deductions for pre- accident damage
alloy wheel £140.00
wing mirror £  40.00
door £  60.00
total £   240.00
sub-total £2,360.50
20% deduction as previous write off  £   490.19
pre-accident value £1,870.31
policy excess £   770.00
payment £1,100.31
By the final response, Advantage increased its offer. It said it had increased the figure of
£2,600.50 for pre-accident value to £2,680.00, an extra £79.50 which it would pay Mr K.
Unhappy with that, Mr K brought his complaint to us in mid-November 2020.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. She thought that
the valuation was fair but  due to the age of the car - the deduction of £240.00 for pre-
accident damage wasnt fair. She recommended that Advantage should pay Mr K £240.00.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr K 
and to Advantage on 18 May 2021. I summarise my findings:
My figures were follows:
pre-accident value (if not previous write off) £2,600.50
deduction for pre- accident damage £   100.00
sub-total £2,500.50
deduction as previous write off £   375.00
pre-accident value £2,125.42
less policy excess £   770.00
less payment £1,100.31
less payment £     79.50
balance £   175.61
Subject to any further information from Mr K or from Advantage, my provisional decision was 
that I upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct Advantage Insurance Company 
Limited to pay Mr K  in addition to the £1,179.81 it has already paid him:
1. a further £175.61 for his damaged car; and
2. simple interest on £175.61 at the yearly rate of 8% for the period from the date of 
his claim to the date of its payment. If Advantage considers that its required by 
HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr 
K how much its taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he 
asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if 
appropriate.
Mr K hasnt responded to the provisional decision. 
Advantage disagrees with the provisional decision. It says, in summary, that:
It paid Mr K £1,176.81 after the deductions made. 
The 20% deduction for the previous total loss (PTL) was made to the lesser offer of 
£2,600.50, therefore it deducted £520.10 as opposed to £536.00 which equates to a 
19.4% deduction.
It has often deducted 20% for PTL and this is decided and deducted by a qualified 
engineer. It questions our deduction of 15%.
Its qualified in-house engineers estimate the pre-accident damage (PAD), minus the 
damage to the wing mirror totals £1,026.78. it deducted £240.00 in total for damage 
that would have cost over £1,000.00 to repair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For a car like Mr Ks in August 2020, if it were undamaged and with no previous write-off, the
trade guides include the following figures:
CAP £2,525.00
Cazana £2,297.00
Glasss £2,680.00
The average of those figures is about £2,500.00. So Im satisfied with Advantages figure or
£2,680.00 - as a starting point.
Mr K accepts that  before the accident - his car had alloy wheel damage and minor damage
to a door. He says that there was no other damage.
The circumstances of the accident involved damage to the front and underside of the car.
Mr K says the wing mirror was damaged during the accident and during recovery of his car.
On balance, I find that Advantage has fallen short of showing pre-accident damage to the
wing mirror.
And in any event, many owners of older cars leave minor damage unrepaired. So the cost of
repair is notional and doesnt detract from the value of the car on a pound-for-pound basis. I
often find it fair to say that the value of an older car is reduced by 50% of the cost of repair.
Advantage has recently provided an estimate of over £1000.00 to repair pre-accident 
damage to the door and alloys. But I place more weight on its earlier figure of £240.00 
including the wing mirror. I find it fair and reasonable to allow a deduction of £100.00 for pre-
accident damage.
In my view, the pre-accident value of the car wasnt enhanced by its high standard of
maintenance  or by the amount of petrol in its tank.
Advantage is bound by the Financial Conduct Authoritys dispute resolution rules (DISP). I
consider that it was bound to treat Mr Ks questions and comments as a complaint.
From the call recordings, Im satisfied that Advantage called Mr K to discuss his complaint 
and I dont consider that Advantage put Mr K under pressure or said anything inappropriate.
Mr K had bought the car knowing of the 2017 write-off. No doubt he paid a price that
reflected it. So I dont find it unfair for Advantage to make a deduction for that.
However, I dont understand its figures. The final response letter mentioned a 20%
deduction for the previous write-off. It didnt mention the figure of £490.19. I have calculated
that figure from the other figures in the final response letter. But £490.19 is 20% of £2,450.95
 a figure that doesnt correspond to Advantages pre-accident valuation of £2,600.50 or the
sub-total of £2,360.50 after its deduction of £240.00 for pre-accident damage.
When Advantage increased the pre-accident valuation to £2,680.00 it didnt apply the 20%
deduction to the increase.
A percentage of 20% is at the top end of what I would find fair and reasonable as a
deduction for a previous write-off. And in Mr Ks case I dont find 20% fair in addition to a
deduction for pre-accident damage. 
So Ive thought about what figures would be fair and reasonable. Advantages figure of£2,600.50 was at the top end of the trade guides. And  keeping in mind the additional 
deduction for pre-accident damage  I find it fair to make a deduction for the previous write-
off of £375.00 - 15% of the figure of £2,500.00. In summary, my figures as follows:
pre-accident value (if not previous write off) £2,600.50
deduction for pre- accident damage £   100.00
sub-total £2,500.50
deduction as previous write off £   375.00
pre-accident value £2,125.42
less policy excess £   770.00
less payment £1,100.31
less payment £     79.50
balance £   175.61
However, I consider that Mr K has fallen short of showing that Advantage caused him any
other financial loss. And  notwithstanding that I uphold his complaint in part  I dont find it 
fair and reasonable to direct Advantage to compensate Mr K for the time and the trouble he 
went to in pursuing his complaint.
 
Putting things right
So I will direct Advantage to pay Mr K  in addition to the £ £1,179.81 it has already
paid him - a further £175.61 for his damaged car.
As Ive taken the view that Advantage shouldve paid that amount to Mr K sooner, I find it fair
to direct Advantage to pay simple interest on it at our usual rate.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Advantage Insurance Company Limited to pay Mr K  in addition to the £1,179.81 it 
has already paid him:
1. a further £175.61 for his damaged car; and
2. simple interest on £175.61 at the yearly rate of 8% for the period from the date of his 
claim to the date of its payment. If Advantage considers that its required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr K how 
much its taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for 
one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2021.
