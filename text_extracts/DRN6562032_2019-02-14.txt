K821x#15complaint
Ms E complains  about the interest  and charges that Shop Direct  Finance  Company Limited  
has applied  to her account and about the default that its recorded on her account.
background
Ms E opened a credit account  with Shop Direct  in January 2013. Her last payment to the 
account was in August 2015  and she says that her health issues and financial difficulties 
have stopped her making payments since then. She contacted  Shop Direct  about those 
difficulties in November  2015. It stopped applying interest and charges to the account in 
February 2016 and it defaulted her account in July 2018. 
Ms E complained to Shop Direct but she wasnt satisfied with its response so complained  to 
this service. She would  like it to remove all interest and charges applied  to her account  since 
June 2015 and compensation for the way that shes been treated.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld.  He said that Ms E 
hadnt made any payments to her account  between August 2015 and February 2016 so the 
interest and charges prior to February 2016 had been fairly applied  but none shouldve been  
added after that date (and Shop Direct has confirmed that no charges were  applied following 
February 2016). But he thought that Shop  Direct shouldve defaulted the account  in February 
2016  so he recommended that the default was backdated to February 2016.
Shop Direct has accepted the investigators  recommendation and agreed to backdate  the 
default to March 2016  which is six months after Ms E last payment that was made in 
September 2015. Ms E has asked for her complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman. 
She says,  in summary, that the default  should  be backdated even further and that charges 
applied to the account prior to February 2016  should  be removed from the account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I sympathise with Ms E for the health 
issues and financial difficulties that shes suffering.
Ms Es last payment to her account  was the August 2015 payment that Shop Direct received 
in September  2015. She contacted Shop Direct about her health  issues  and financial 
difficulties in November  2015 and its account  notes show that she said that shed been  
having difficulties  since June 2015 and that she wanted interest and charges removed from 
her account.  But Shop  Direct says that its letter to her in January 2016 said that she hadnt 
provided it with information about her finances  or made any repayment proposals.
But it stopped applying interest  and charges  to her account in February  2016   and it says 
that no interest or charges  have been  added to the account since  then. I consider  that to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances  and Im not persuaded that it would  be fair or 
reasonable for it to refund any interest or charges that were applied  to the account before 
February 2016.
Shop Direct has now agreed to backdate the default  to March 2016   which  it says is six 
months after the last payment was received from Ms E in September  2015. I consider that to 
Ref: DRN65620322be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. And Im not persuaded that it would  be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Shop Direct  to backdate the default to before March  2016.   
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Ms Es complaint in part. And I order  Shop 
Direct Finance Company  Limited to backdate the default to show  that the account  was 
defaulted in March 2016.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
