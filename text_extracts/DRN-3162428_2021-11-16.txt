The complaint
Mr C complains that the amount of tax-free cash he received from Aviva Life & Pensions UK 
Limited (Aviva) was less than hed previously been told. And that errors and delays caused 
by Aviva led to the reduction in the value he eventually received.  
What happened
Mr C had a pension plan with Aviva. In 2015, hed received confirmation from Aviva that he 
could take the entire value of the plan as tax-free cash.
On 10 February 2020 Mr Cs adviser requested a current value of the plan and the form he 
would need to cash it in. She sent a letter of authority to Aviva on 14 February 2020. The 
adviser called Aviva to chase up her request on 17 February 2020. She said she was told itd 
only been logged that day, and that the timescales for turnaround were 10 working days. 
The adviser called Aviva again on 28 February 2020 as the requested information still hadnt 
been provided.
The adviser received a letter from Aviva dated 3 March 2020. The letter showed that Mr C 
wasnt eligible to take all of his plan as tax-free cash. It showed a figure of £54,510.59 as the 
current fund value. The adviser called Aviva on 10 March 2020 and 11 March 2020. And 
replied to the 3 March 2020 letter on 11 March 2020. She asked for the value itd shown to 
be double checked, as it was the same value thatd been quoted as at 13 February 2019. 
She also noted that the entire value of the plan could be taken as tax-free cash. She asked 
Aviva to log her letter as a formal complaint given the incorrect information, noting that Mr C 
had been inconvenienced by the inaccuracies. The adviser called Aviva again on 12 March 
2020. They confirmed theyd received her complaint letter.
On 13 March 2020, Aviva sent vesting options and forms for how Mr C could access his 
pension plan. Mr Cs adviser said she hadnt requested vesting options. She said she only 
wanted the valuation and a form to be able to cash in the plan. The ability to take Mr Cs 
entire fund value as tax-free cash wasnt listed as an option. Instead, five other options were 
listed. And a taxed full cash option was listed separately. The fund value was quoted as 
£59,646.91, as at 11 March 2020.  
On 28 March 2020 Aviva wrote to Mr Cs adviser. They confirmed he was entitled to take the 
entire value of his plan as tax-free cash. But the letter only showed the plan value as at 6 
April 2006. So on 31 March 2020 Mr Cs adviser wrote to Aviva to ask for the current value 
of the plan and to check whether or not there was a market value reduction being applied. 
She also asked for the correct form to be sent to Mr C so he could take the value of his plan 
as tax-free cash.
On 31 March 2020, Aviva issued their final response letter for the complaint. They 
acknowledged their error around the amount of tax-free cash Mr C could take. And 
confirmed he could take up to 100% of his fund as tax-free cash. They issued a replacement 
letter with the correct figures. And awarded £150 for the inconvenience theyd caused.
On 16 April 2020 Aviva replied to Mr Cs advisers 31 March 2020 request. Mr C said they 
sent the correct form. They gave the current transfer value as £59,646.91 as at 11 March 
2020. And they confirmed there was no market value reduction applicable. 
Mr Cs adviser said Mr C completed and returned the form to cash in his plan to Aviva on 23 
April 2020. Aviva said they received this on 27 April 2020. And that it allowed them to issue 
the 8 May 2020 options pack. This pack still stated that the value of the plan was £59,646.91 
at 11 March 2020. 
On 18 May 2020 Mr C signed the paperwork required to take his pension plan as tax-free 
cash. Aviva received it on 20 May 2020. On 2 June 2020 Mr C called Aviva to confirm he 
had enough Lifetime Allowance to cover the cash payment. Mr C said he received payment 
on 5 June 2020. The payment he received was for £55,775.36, £3,871.55 less than had 
been quoted on the 16 April 2020 letter.
Mr Cs adviser called Aviva on 11 June 2020 to query the amount that had been paid. The 
next day Aviva confirmed the fall in value was being investigated. Mr Cs adviser called 
again on 18 June 2020. She said theyd sent no confirmation of the payment to Mr C. Aviva 
confirmed the amount paid into Mr Cs account on 29 June 2020. In their 10 July 2020 letter, 
Aviva confirmed that the bonus review took place before the 8 May 2020 options pack was 
sent out. They said that the quote sent on that date wasnt based on up-to-date bonus rates. 
They acknowledged that Mr C may have made decisions based on the higher value theyd 
quoted. And offered to compensate Mr C for any financial loss hed incurred due to them not 
sending the correct quotation. They also offered £250 compensation for the distress theyd 
caused. 
Mr Cs adviser made another complaint in reference to that letter, on 13 July 2020. Aviva 
replied to that complaint on 15 September 2020. They acknowledged that the 8 May 2020 
update theyd sent included the same pension figures as at 11 March 2020. But they said 
that due to the actual final value of Mr Cs plan being only 9% lower than that quoted, they 
didn't contact him to ask if he still wished to continue. Aviva also acknowledged that theyd 
made mistakes when processing Mr Cs retirement benefits. But said that theyd paid £400 
compensation. And offered to review any financial losses caused by not sending the lower 
quotation value.
Mr C brought his complaint to this service through his adviser. In his initial view, our 
investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. He felt that although Mr C had 
suffered a loss of expectation, Aviva shouldnt be asked to fund the shortfall as the values 
theyd quoted were estimates. But he noted that Aviva had got things wrong. He reviewed 
the steps theyd taken and the compensation theyd offered. He felt that the £400 theyd 
offered in total (£150 after their initial error and £250 after that) was fair under the 
circumstances. He also noted that if a financial loss could be demonstrated as a direct result 
of not receiving the correct information in May 2020, hed be happy to ask Aviva to recognise 
this. 
Mr C and his adviser disagreed with our investigator. They said that during the time it took 
Aviva to address their mistakes, the bonus rates and terminal bonus rates changed. They 
said that this resulted in Mr C ending up with less tax-free cash than he wouldve received if 
no errors had been made, as he wouldnt have been subject to Avivas rate review. Mr C 
asked why he was being penalised due to Avivas delays. And said that he hadnt received 
the £250 offered in Avivas July 2020 letter.
Mr C asked us to get Aviva to share the dates they changed their bonus rates between 11 
March 2020 and 5 June 2020. He said he wanted an informed judgement to be made about 
whether Avivas delays had led to a reduction in the tax-free cash he received. He confirmed 
his complaint was about the delay Aviva caused in getting the correct information and forms to him.
Our investigator considered the points Mr C and his adviser had made. He told Aviva that 
their £250 offer hadnt been paid. He asked them to confirm the date the withdrawal request 
was processed and the value at that date. He also asked them to comment on how soon Mr 
C couldve withdrawn his tax-free cash, and at what value, if the correct information had 
been provided at the start. 
Aviva told our investigator that the £250 had in fact been paid on 18 August 2020. They 
confirmed that the date used to value the fund was 20 May 2020 as that was the date the 
claim from was received. And that the value at that date was £55,775.36. Aviva 
acknowledged that there was a delay between 3 March 2020 and 28 March 2020 where the 
amount of tax-free cash that could be paid was in question. But said the correct option form 
was sent on 16 March 2020 which Mr C could use to start his claim. They said this form 
wasnt used, but that a further copy was requested. They said they issued that on 14 April 
2020. They confirmed that the date the final bonus rate changed was 22 April 2020. So they 
didnt consider that Mr Cs claim couldve been made before that rate change. And they felt 
that hed been paid the correct amount. 
Our investigator asked Mr C if he could demonstrate financial loss as a direct result of 
receiving the incorrect quotes. Mr C said it would be very difficult to quantify the loss.
Our investigator issued a second view. He still didnt think the complaint should be upheld. 
He felt that even when taking account of the delays Aviva had caused between 3 March 
2020 and 28 March 2020, Mr C wouldnt have been able to access the value of his plan until 
after the final bonus rate changed on 22 April 2020. So he didnt think Aviva should be asked 
to do anything else.
Mr C and his adviser didnt agree. They felt Aviva had wasted time and that this caused Mr C 
a financial loss. They didnt think Aviva had acted accurately or with speed at any point in the 
process. And they thought Aviva had got many things wrong. They didnt think Mr C had 
been treated fairly. And considered that hed been penalised for Avivas mistakes and 
delays. They said Mr C couldve avoided the final bonus rate reduction if Aviva had given 
him correct information and acted without delay from the outset. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me for review.
I issued a provisional decision on 19 October 2021. It said: 
I have carefully considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I intend to uphold this complaint. I consider that Mr C wouldve been able to access his tax-
free cash before Avivas terminal bonus rate review on 22 April 2020 if hed been given the 
correct information and forms from the outset. Ill explain why. 
In complaints like this I normally ask myself two questions: 
1. did the business do something wrong, or treat the consumer unfairly? 
2. did that lead to the consumer suffering (eg a financial loss, distress, inconvenience) 
unnecessarily? 
Ill only generally uphold a complaint if the answer to both questions is yes. Theres no dispute that Aviva did something wrong. But as this was only part of the equation, 
I went on to consider how this affected Mr C. 
Mr C simply wanted to access his tax-free cash. Through his adviser, the form hed need to 
complete was requested on 10 February 2020. Aviva received the required paperwork to 
complete the process on 20 May 2020. Ive looked at how the process shouldve worked to 
assess whether the delays led to a loss for Mr C.
When should Mr C have accessed his tax-free cash?
Ive considered when Mr C shouldve accessed his tax-free cash if thered been no errors or 
delays to the process. In order to do this, Ive tried to establish the date the value of his fund 
shouldve been taken at, if everything had gone smoothly. But its extremely difficult to work 
out exactly when Mr Cs tax-free cash payment shouldve been paid. There have been a 
number of delays to the process through the provision of incorrect information and incorrect 
forms being provided. 
Aviva accepted they caused a delay between 3 March 2020 and 28 March 2020. But they 
also said that they sent out the correct forms for the withdrawal on 13 March 2020. So its 
not completely clear when the process shouldve completed. 
So Ive considered when the correct form was first sent out. I can see that Aviva said this 
was 13 March 2020. But Mr C said this was 16 April 2020. The 13 March 2020 letter is a 37-
page document. It contains five options which include an annuity, four of which also include 
some tax-free cash. On page 19 of this document, a one-off payment option is listed 
separately from the other five numbered options. This shows the fund value as £59,646.91, 
but then shows a tax deduction. So I dont consider that this shows Mr Cs chosen option of 
100% tax-free cash. 
Mr C said: may I remind you that at this point we had been seeking clarification for some 
time from Aviva of what exactly the numbers should be. In addition we had been provided 
with such poor service and inaccurate data regarding this policy in the past that Aviva 
themselves made a financial payment in way of apology . And: Why on earth would I or 
anyone in their right mind speculatively sign an incorrect document in the hope it would be 
corrected later. I agree with him. Im not surprised that Mr C and his adviser considered that 
it wasnt suitable for them to complete the form related to this taxed option that was included 
from page 28 of the 13 March 2020 document. I acknowledge that the form is very similar to 
the one sent on 16 April 2020. But the form sent on that date was connected to a document 
that contained the correct tax-free cash quote Mr C had been waiting for. So Im satisfied 
that the form contained in the 16 April 2020 pack was the first form Aviva couldve 
reasonably expected Mr C to complete, given that he wanted to take 100% of his fund as 
tax-free cash. 
In summary, I agree with Mr C and his adviser that they shouldnt have been required to 
complete forms for an option that hadnt been listed in the paperwork theyd been sent. So 
Im satisfied that the correct forms were first sent out on 16 April 2020. 
Given that, Ive considered the process for taking the tax-free cash as a whole. 
The first request on 10 February 2020 was for the current plan value and forms. The 
turnaround time for requests like this was 10 working days. So the response shouldve been 
received no later than 24 February 2020. A partial response was actually received on 3 
March 2020. So this was 6 working days late. This response included an out of date fund 
value and the incorrect percentage of tax-free cash that could be taken was quoted.The errors in the response led to a complaint on 11 March 2020. And responses to the 
complaint on 28 March 2020 and 31 March 2020. From what Ive seen, Aviva have accepted 
they caused a delay from 3 March 2020 to 28 March 2020  this was 18 working days. The 
28 March 2020 letter confirmed that 100% of the fund could be taken as tax-free cash. But 
showed the plan value from 2006. Aviva noted that the 13 March 2020 pack included the 
fund value at 11 March 2020 and had forms that could be used to access the funds. But this 
pack only showed the full cash option as taxed, so was incorrect. So Im satisfied it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable to expect Mr C to complete the form attached to that pack. 
It wasnt until 16 April 2020 that Aviva gave both a relatively up-to-date fund value 
(£59,646.91 as at 11 March 2020). And included the correct forms with full tax-free cash for 
the first time.
Mr C completed the form on 23 April 2020. And Aviva received it on 27 April 2020. Aviva 
then issued a further pack on 8 May 2020. This contained the fund value at 11 March 2020, 
rather than an up-to-date value. As Aviva had changed their final bonus rate on 22 April 
2020, this is significant, as the 8 May 2020 pack included a value from before the final bonus 
rates were reduced. 
On 18 May 2020 Mr C signed the final paperwork. Aviva received it on 20 May 2020. And 
made the payment on 5 June 2020. Mr C received £55,775.36, £3,871.55 less than had 
been quoted on the 16 April 2020 letter.
Based on this timeline, I consider Aviva caused 24 working days delay in total, allowing for 
bank holidays. Based on the actual date of 20 May 2020 that Aviva used to calculate the tax-
free cash, Im persuaded that the date that shouldve been used was 14 April 2020. This is 
before the final bonus rate reduction.
I acknowledge that its difficult to establish the exact date a process shouldve taken place. 
Looking at the timeline detailed above, there are a number of ways I could calculate the 
length of delay caused by Aviva. I could look at the gap between the first request and the 
date that request was fully answered. Or I could look at the time between the first set of 
incorrect vesting options being sent on 13 March 2020 and the second correct pack being 
sent on 16 April 2020. Both of these alternative methods lead to a date when the tax-free 
cash shouldve been calculated thats before 22 April 2020. So Im satisfied that Avivas 
delay did cause Mr C to be affected by their bonus rate review. And that his tax-free cash 
shouldve been calculated on or around 14 April 2020.
Should Aviva honour the £59,641.91 quoted in their 8 May 2020 pack?
Mr C has asked that Aviva make up the difference between the £55,775.36 he received on 5 
June 2020 and the £59,641.91 Aviva quoted in their 8 May 2020 pack. This figure was also 
quoted in their 13 March 2020 pack. 
In their 13 March 2020 pack, Aviva said: it's important to remember that these values are 
only a guide and your actual fund value when you retire may be different, fund values can go 
down as well as up and are not guaranteed.
And in their 8 May 2020 pack, Aviva said: We'll work out the final value of your plan on your 
actual retirement date or when we have received everything we need, if this is a later date. 
Please remember your value could go down as well as up and is not guaranteed.
I consider that these warnings were clear. So Im not persuaded that Aviva should have to 
pay Mr C an amount that was correct at a certain date, but had changed by the time he 
accessed his tax-free cash. That wouldnt be fair or reasonable. However, I am satisfied that Mr C shouldve been able to access his tax-free cash at an 
earlier date than he did. Im satisfied that if Aviva had given Mr Cs adviser the correct 
information in a timely manner after she first requested it on 10 February 2020, Mr C 
wouldve accessed his tax-free cash much earlier, on or around 14 April 2020. 
Ill now consider whether the compensation Aviva have already paid for distress and 
inconvenience was reasonable.
Distress and inconvenience
Mr C said that: The issue here is and has always been the delta in monies paid on the 
policy not the £250 offered in way of compensation. 
Aviva made a series of errors in their handling of Mr Cs access to his tax-free cash. These 
wouldve been frustrating. Theyve taken considerable effort to correct. 
Aviva awarded £150 for the inconvenience theyd caused when theyd incorrectly quoted the 
amount of tax-free cash Mr C could take from his plan. They also paid £250 for issuing the 8 
May 2020 options pack with an out of date value. They offered to compensate Mr C for any 
financial loss hed incurred due to them not sending the correct quotation. But unfortunately 
Mr C hasnt been able to evidence that loss.
Given what Mr C has said, and as I intend to ask Aviva to put Mr C back into the position he 
wouldve been in had they not caused any delays to the process, I dont intend to ask Aviva 
to pay additional compensation for the distress and inconvenience their errors have caused. 
Having said that, I am satisfied that the compensation offered for distress and inconvenience 
was reasonable under the circumstances of the complaint.  
Response to my provisional decision
Mr C accepted my provisional decision. 
Aviva didnt respond.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
No new information has come to light to change my opinion. So I remain of the view I set out 
in my provisional decision.
  
Putting things right
I require Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to calculate the fund value as at 14 April 2020. If 
this value is higher than the amount Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited paid to Mr C as at 20 
May 2020 on 5 June 2020, I intend to ask Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to pay Mr C the 
difference. I also require Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to add interest to the payment at 
a rate of 8% simple per year, calculated from 14 April 2020 until the date of payment. 
Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited should provide details of the calculations to Mr C in a clear 
and simple format.  
My final decisionI uphold the complaint. Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited should pay the amount calculated 
under Putting things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
