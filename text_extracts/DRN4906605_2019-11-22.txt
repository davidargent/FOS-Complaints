MYJAR has made an offer to pay compensation for loans 2 and 3. It has offered  to do this in 
line with how our service would recommend putting  things right. So as MYJAR has offered to 
do this and the two loans  are no longer in dispute,  I havent considered  them.
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that MYJAR shouldnt have 
approved loans 5 to 9. MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  so the complaint has 
been passed to me, an ombudsman, to make  a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN49066052the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint. Ive decided  to uphold Ms Bs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Ms B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 and 4 not being  upheld. 
And MYJAR  has offered to pay compensation for loans 2 and 3. Because of this I dont think  
there is any ongoing disagreement about these 4 loans. So I wont  be making  a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Ms B had with MYJAR. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
As our adjudicator explained, by loan 5, I think its reasonable to say that Ms B was, more 
likely than not, having longer term problems managing her money. And MYJAR  shouldve 
been aware of this. She had taken  out four short term loans in quick succession with small 
breaks in between. So a pattern  of dependency  was already emerging in respect of his 
lending. 
Ms B took out loan 5 on 19th November 2016  and at this stage MYJAR had seen her making 
repayments to it for just under  a year. The amounts  she was paying was for a similar amount 
and I think it would have  become apparent  at this stage that she would have  been  struggling 
to repay  the amount owed.  So I dont  think it was reasonable for MYJAR to have assumed 
that Ms B would  be in a position to make further  repayments without it causing her problems. 
So I dont  think it shouldve approved loan 5. So Im upholding Ms Bs complaint about it. 
And Ive looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Ms B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Bs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN49066053By loan 6, the amounts  Ms B was borrowing had not decreased, and going forward  
Ms B was provided  with a new loan within a very short  time of settling a previous 
one. 
MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Ms B was having  to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Ms Bs indebtedness had become unsustainable.
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed MYJAR. Loan 9 was 
taken out over 20 months after Ms Bs first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms B had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect; service  a debt to MYJAR over an 
extended period.
I think that Ms B lost out because MYJAR continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans,
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 9, along with loan 5 and MYJAR should 
now put things  right. MYJAR should also look to pay compensation for loans 2 and 3 also as 
it has already offered  to.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans 2 and 3 along with 5 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 2,3 and 5 from Ms Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 8 should be removed from Ms Bs 
credit file. MYJAR should do this for loan 9 if it is able,  but it may not be able to do 
this if the loan is still outstanding. 
If Ms B still owes MYJAR any of the principal  balance  she borrowed on her final loan MYJAR  
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. MYJAR  
should then re-work  the account as if all payments made by Ms B went towards the principal. 
But importantly, MYJAR  needs to make sure that Ms B doesnt repay more than the principal  
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Ms B hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed MYJAR can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Ms B has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if MYJAR no longer owns this debt,  and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount  
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Ms B.
Ref: DRN49066054*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Ms Bs complaint.
MYJAR Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019
