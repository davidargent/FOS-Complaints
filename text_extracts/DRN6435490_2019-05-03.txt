K822xcomplaint
Mr J complains that Callcredit Consumer Limited  (trading as Noddle) took too long to remove 
information from his credit file.
background 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mr Js complaint and to 
require Callcredit  to pay him £100 compensation. I invited Mr J and Callcredit to let me have 
any further evidence  or arguments they wanted to make before I finally  determined  the 
matter.
Mr J said he agreed with my provisional  decision.  Callcredit didnt reply.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J accepts my provisional decision and Callcredit hasnt replied. So I see no reason to 
reach different conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint. Callcredit Consumer Limited must pay 
compensation of £100 to Mr J.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 June 2019.
