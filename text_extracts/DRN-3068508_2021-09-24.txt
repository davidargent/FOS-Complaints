The complaint
Miss H is unhappy with the service that shes received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA,
surrounding their decision to decline a request for reimbursement that she made under their
buyer protection scheme.  
What happened
Miss H purchased a laptop online for £1,048.00 using her PayPal account to pay for the
item. When the laptop was delivered, Miss H wasnt at home and the package was left with
her neighbour by the courier. When Miss H received the package, she discovered that the
laptop box was empty. Miss H approached the vendor for a refund but was unsuccessful.
Miss H then made a claim with PayPal for reimbursement via their buyer protection scheme.
PayPal asked for a police report or fraud action report from Miss H, both of which Miss H
provided. PayPal then declined Miss Hs reimbursement claim on the basis that the
documents that theyd received from Miss H were invalid because certain aspects of the
reports hadnt been completed correctly.
Miss H wasnt happy about this, especially as she had informed PayPal that she had
learning difficulties and struggled with forms, and because shed made several phone calls
to PayPal seeking confirmation that the documents and information that shed sent to them
was correct. So, she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Hs complaint, but it remained their decision that the supporting
documents sent by Miss H were invalid, so they didnt uphold the complaint.
Miss H wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayPal hadnt made
reasonable adjustments to their process upon being told of Miss Hs learning difficulties, and
they acknowledged that Miss H had made significant efforts to try to ensure that she was
providing the information that PayPal needed to enable them to proceed with her claim.
Because of this, our investigator recommended that the complaint be upheld in Miss Hs
favour and that PayPal should reopen the claim and allow Miss H to provide updated
information to enable her claim to be progressed. 
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 24 August 2021 as follows:
I will be provisionally upholding this complaint in Miss Hs favour. However,
my provisional instructions to PayPal will differ from those recommended by our 
investigator, and Ive issued a provisional decision on this basis to give both Miss H 
and PayPal the opportunity to respond.
One of the reasons that Ill be provisionally upholding this complaint in Miss Hs 
favour is that, having listened to a series of telephone calls between Miss H and 
PayPal, Im satisfied that Miss H did inform PayPal on several occasions that she 
struggled with learning difficulties and that PayPal didnt make reasonable 
adjustments to their process so as to enable Miss H to be able to fairly proceed with 
her reimbursement claim.
Additionally, its evident from the telephone calls that Ive listened to that Miss H was 
making significant efforts to try to ensure that the information that PayPal were 
requesting to progress her claim was provided to them, including providing a Crime 
Reference Number from the police as well as an Action Fraud report. Indeed, Im 
satisfied that Miss H did make concerted efforts to provide PayPal with all the 
information that they requested of her.
Its also evident, however, that Miss Hs customer journey in this regard could have 
been, and should have been, significantly easier, and that Miss Hs attempts to 
progress her claim were hindered by the disjointed nature of PayPals own processes 
- such that Im satisfied that an unfair outcome has come about as a result.
Particularly notable is a sequence of events that includes Miss H telephoning PayPal 
to check on the status of her claim and being told that everything is in order and that 
she will be receiving a reimbursement, then soon afterwards receiving an email 
advising that her claim has been declined, followed by Miss H calling and being told 
that the declining of her claim was being appealed, only then to call a few days later 
seeking an update and being told that no appeal had in fact been raised.
Also notable is that on several of these calls Miss H makes specific reference to her 
learning disabilities and that shes calling to check that the information that shes 
providing is what PayPal wants because she struggles with forms and written 
communication, and also that Miss H asks to speak with the department to whom the 
information is forwarded to get clarity from that department, only to be told repeatedly 
that this isnt possible.
I can understand Miss Hs frustration here, and its very difficult for me to draw any
conclusion other than that PayPal didnt make the reasonable adjustments that would 
have been expected of them in this instance in light of Miss Hs learning difficulties, 
such as making an exception to their non-contact policy with the department in 
question so that Miss H could speak with them and could be provided with a clearer 
understanding of what was required of her.
PayPal have stated that Miss Hs claim was declined because her address wasnt 
completed correctly on one of the forms, and that the amount being claimed differed 
by £0.99. But these appear to be minor technical issues  which are understandable 
given Miss Hs learning difficulties as previously explained - and dont appear to me 
to be such that they can reasonably have any bearing on whether the actual outcome 
of Miss Hs reimbursement claim should be successful. Furthermore, had PayPal 
made the reasonable adjustments to Miss Hs claim process as I feel that they should 
have done, its difficult to envisage these relatively minor issues having the terminal 
effect to Miss Hs claim that they ultimately have.Finally, had PayPal made the reasonable adjustments that would have been 
expected here, its difficult not to conclude that Miss Hs reimbursement claim should 
have been successful. And this is because Miss H has fulfilled all the steps required 
of her by PayPal, including reporting the matter to the police and obtaining an Action 
Fraud report.
As such, Ill be provisionally upholding this complaint in Miss Hs favour and my 
provisional instruction to PayPal will be that they must make a payment of £1,048.00 
to Miss H in honour of her claim, as well as a payment of a further £200.00 to Miss H 
to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that this matter has quite 
obviously caused her.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Miss H and PayPal the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision. Miss H confirmed that she had no further comments to make, whereas PayPal 
did not respond.
As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision on the same basis as described in my 
provisional decision, and so my final decision will be that I uphold this complaint in Miss Hs 
favour on the basis described above.
  
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment of £1,048.00 to Miss H in honour of Miss Hs claim
PayPal must also make a further payment of £200 to Miss H to compensate her for the 
distress and inconvenience she has incurred.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
