K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt adequately  support him when he 
fell victim to a scam  through an online auction  site.
background
In February 2019  Mr T sold a watch on eBay  for £2,150. The buyer,  however, said that there  
was a fault and submitted a return request. He was required to pay the return  postage and to 
send the return  delivery  label  to the buyer, so they could  return  the watch to him. But, Mr T 
says, the buyer didnt  return the watch.  Instead, he received a book and two batteries. 
PayPal returned  the payment to the buyer,  who had made a chargeback claim. 
Mr T reported what had happened  to the police, ActionFraud and to eBay. And he asked 
PayPal to refund the money he says he lost as a result. PayPal refused to do so. It said that 
the buyers chargeback claim had been successful and that there  was, therefore, nothing it 
could do to help Mr T. The final decision on a chargeback claim rests with the card scheme, 
not with PayPal. And it pointed out that its own seller protection  provisions would not cover  
Mr T for claims that goods were not as described or were defective. 
Mr T felt that response was unfair  and unsatisfactory. He felt that PayPals actions were,  in 
effect, facilitating fraud. He referred the matter to this service, where one of our investigators 
considered it. The investigator concluded that PayPal should reimburse Mr T. The 
investigators reasons  were that PayPal hadnt  done enough to defend the chargeback and, 
had it done so, the buyers chargeback claim would not have succeeded. 
PayPal didnt accept  the investigators  conclusions and asked that an ombudsman review  
the case.      
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
investigators overall conclusions. That is, I agree that PayPal should refund Mr Ts payment. 
Ill explain  why. 
The first thing I need to consider is whether Mr Ts account of events is true. PayPal hasnt 
suggested otherwise  and hasnt presented any evidence to counter it. But I nevertheless 
make the following observations:
The buyer claimed that the watch had a fault.  They didnt suggest that theyd been sent 
something different. 
Mr T provided pictures of the parcel  he received back  from the buyer  containing a 
book and some  batteries. He said the postman who delivered the parcel saw him open 
it. 
The parcel that was sent to Mr T came  from a different address from that to which he 
sent the watch.  
The eBay account holders name was different from the name  to which  the watch  was 
delivered.
The sellers  eBay account  has been closed.   
Ref: DRN41352202For these reasons, I accept that Mr T sent the item he sold but received back  items that 
were effectively worthless. I think its reasonable to conclude as well that the buyer (possibly 
with others) had planned to make a false claim and not to return  the watch, but to do enough  
to ensure they had evidence that theyd returned  something to Mr T. 
I therefore have  to consider whether PayPal should have done more to help Mr T. My 
starting point in considering that issue is PayPals  account terms. They include:
a statement  that the seller will owe PayPal an amount  equal  to any chargeback  (plus  
fees) if they lose a chargeback  claim  and are not covered by the Seller  Protection  
Programme; and
statements that seller protection does not apply to chargebacks  where the reason is 
that the item sold was not as described  or claims  filed directly with eBay. 
The buyers refund was made because of a chargeback claim. I therefore  accept  PayPals 
argument that Mr T did not have the benefit  of its seller protection. That meant that any 
dispute between  him and the buyer was to be decided by the chargeback process.  The 
outcome of the chargeback process  was not something over which PayPal had any control. 
Like the investigator, however, I dont  believe thats  the end of the matter.  PayPal  produces  
a guide to chargebacks, which includes information  designed to help customers  who, like Mr 
T, are subject to an unwanted  chargeback.  The guide says that PayPal will help its customer  
put together  a powerful case. 
Ive seen the information that PayPal  submitted for the chargeback  case, but wouldnt 
describe it as powerful. It doesnt include any mention  of Mr Ts belief that hed been a victim 
of fraud, information and evidence of the items  Mr T received  back from the buyer  or the 
other evidence suggesting dishonesty on the part of the buyer.
Notwithstanding PayPals chargeback guide, I think in any event that PayPal ought to have 
presented a fuller  picture in its own submissions. On the face of it, the buyer had returned  
the goods (having alleged they were defective), and so ought to receive  a refund. But the 
true picture was rather different;  PayPal had the information it needed to put Mr Ts case, but 
doesnt appear to have  done so. 
The investigator took the view that, had PayPal submitted that evidence, its more likely  than 
not that the chargeback  claim would  have been decided in Mr Ts favour. I agree with that 
assessment. It seems most unlikely that the buyers  claim  would have  been  successful had 
evidence been  available  that the watch hadnt  in fact been returned  at all.  
 In summary  therefore: 
I accept that Mr T was the victim of a fraud  which  played  out as hes described.
I agree with PayPal  that he did not have the benefit of seller  protection. 
I take the view though that PayPal should  have done more to help with the chargeback 
claim. 
Had it done  so, its likely that the chargeback  claim would have had a different outcome. 
Ref: DRN41352203my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, my final decision is that, in full and final settlement of this 
complaint, PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr T:
£2,150; 
interest on £2,150  at 8% a year simple from the date that sum was taken from his 
account to the date of payment; and 
£150 in recognition  of the distress Mr T has suffered and the trouble to which hes been 
put.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
