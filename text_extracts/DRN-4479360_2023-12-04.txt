The complaint
Mrs S and Mr S complain that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked their business 
account.
What happened
The detailed background of this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here.
Mrs S and Mr S had a business current account with NatWest. In October 2021, a restraint 
order was issued by a court, which permitted Mrs S and Mr S to use their NatWest account 
for business and personal purposes. Mrs S has explained that she used the account to 
receive wages, and pay bills, and suppliers, and any other expenses needed to keep her 
business afloat. 
In July 2022, NatWest blocked and reviewed Mrs S and Mr Ss account. This meant they 
werent able to access the funds in the account. The account also couldnt receive any 
credits and no direct debits could be made. The account was blocked between 22 July and 5 
August 2022.  
Mrs S has said that due to the block on her account she had to borrow money to keep her 
business going, incurred charges for payment terminals she was unable to use because 
multiple direct debits had been blocked, and she lost business because she couldnt take 
payments. Mrs S says she was also forced to use her daughters account which was 
stressful and made running her business more difficult. Mrs S says NatWest should have 
warned her that the account was going to be blocked and that NatWest actions are contrary 
to what is specified in the court order. So, she wants NatWest to explain why it blocked the 
account.
Mrs S complained to NatWest. In response NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong and 
was complying with its legal and regulatory obligations when it had blocked the account. As 
a gesture of goodwill, it offered to refund Mrs S £120 worth of account charges. 
Unhappy with this response, Mrs S and Mr S brought their complaint to our service where an 
investigator considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about 
why it had blocked the account. But NatWest said it couldnt provide anything more than it 
had already provided to us. The bank maintained that it hadnt treated Mrs S unfairly when it 
had blocked her account. 
The investigator said based on the limited information the bank had provided, she couldnt 
say the bank had treated Mrs S and Mr S fairly when it had blocked their account. So, she 
said NatWest should pay Mrs S and Mr S £400 compensation, refund the £120 account 
charges, and pay interest on this amount for any trouble and upset the block had caused 
them. 
In response to the investigators view NatWest provided more information about the reasons 
it blocked Mrs Ss account. The investigator looked at everything again and said that 
NatWest hadnt treated Mrs S and Mr S unfairly. She said that NatWests offer to refund 
£120 was fair.  In response , Mrs S said she isnt interested in financial compensation. She 
wants to know why NatWest blocked the account.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mrs S and Mr S, but Id like to reassure them 
that I have considered everything.
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect 
persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Theyre also required 
to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means 
they need to restrict customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out their 
review. The terms of the account also permit NatWest to block an account. This means 
NatWest is entitled to block and review an account at any time.
Having looked at all the evidence, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances 
for NatWest to block Mrs S and Mr Ss account. NatWest has explained that this was its 
standard procedure, and I accept that it was. Im satisfied that in doing so NatWest were 
complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. So, whilst I accept, the banks actions 
caused Mrs S and Mr S inconvenience and upset when it blocked their account, I cant say 
the bank did anything wrong and treated them unfairly in doing so. 
I understand of course why Mrs S wants to know the exact reasons behind NatWests 
decision. And I can see that Mrs S has asked NatWest to explain itself on several occasions. 
But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their accounts. And 
its under no obligation to tell Mrs S the reasons behind the account review and block, as 
much as shed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mrs S this 
information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so. 
Finally, Mrs S has said that because of the account block multiple direct debits went unpaid  
which included several to payment terminal providers. As a result, she incurred account 
charges. NatWest has agreed to refund some of the account charges as a gesture of 
goodwill. Thats not an admission that they applied the charges unfairly. Having looked at the 
terms and conditions of the account, I find that the charges were applied correctly and in line 
with the terms and conditions. NatWest has said its gesture of goodwill remains open so I 
will leave it up to Mrs S to decide if she wishes to accept it. 
In summary, based on the evidence Ive seen, I cant say NatWest has acted unreasonably 
and treated Mrs S and Mr S unfairly when it blocked their account. So, I wont be asking 
NatWest to do anything more to resolve their complaint.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask W and W to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 January 2024.
