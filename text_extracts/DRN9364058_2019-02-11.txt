K821x#15complaint
Miss R says Revase Ltd trading as Cashconverters  lent to her irresponsibly. She says that 
she couldnt afford to make the loan repayments. 
background
This complaint is about 41 payday  loans  Cashconverters  provided Miss R between 
July 2012 and February 2016. Ive attached an appendix which  shows some of the 
information Cashconverters  has provided  about  these  loans.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Both Miss R and Cashconverters didnt  
respond to our adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Miss Rs case. Having done this Ive decided to 
uphold Miss Rs complaint  in part and Ive explained  why below.
Cashconverters needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Miss R could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Rs income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with loans is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Miss Rs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.did Cashconverters, each time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  
to satisfy itself that Miss R would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Miss R would have  been  able to do so?
Ref: DRN936405822.taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Miss Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.did Cashconverters act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Miss Rs 
complaint.
Did Cashconverters, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Miss R would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those 
checks have shown  that Miss R would have been able to do so?
Our adjudicator looked at the checks Cashconverters made for loans 1 to 13 and whether 
better checks wouldve  made a difference to its lending  decisions in some cases. He said 
that he thought  that Cashconverters couldve made  better  checks for loan 10. But that loans 
1 to 13 were likely to appear  affordable to Cashconverters in any event.  
Miss R didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about loans 1 to 13. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss R had with 
Cashconverters. So they are something  I will take into account  when  considering the other  
loans she took.
I havent thought about  individual,  proportionate  affordability checks for loans 14 to 41 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Miss Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Cashconverters should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. And so Cashconverters shouldve realised that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further lending. Given the particular circumstances of Miss Rs case, I think that 
this point was reached  by loan 14. I say this because:
the amounts  Miss R was borrowed didnt decrease. And, particularly over loans 14 to 
24, Miss R borrowed larger amounts. Cashconverters ought to have realised it was 
possible Miss Rs indebtedness was a problem
Miss R wasnt  making any real inroads into the amount she owed Cashconverters. 
She was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period.  Miss R had been borrowing without a significant break from 
Cashconverters for just over year by loan 14. And Cashconverters  continued to 
approve loans  for over three  and a half years after this
I think that Miss Rs lost out because Cashconverters continued to provide loans from loan 
14 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
Ref: DRN93640583the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Miss Rs complaint about  loans 14 to 41 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and shes lost out as a result.
Did Cashconverters act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Cashconverters acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss R in 
some other way.  
putting things right  what Cashconverters  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss R paid on loans 14 to 41
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*
the number  of loans taken from loan 14 means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 14 to 41 should be removed from Miss Rs 
credit file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashconverters  to take off tax from this interest. 
Cashconverters must  give Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Miss Rs 
complaint. Revase Ltd should pay redress as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 March 2019.
