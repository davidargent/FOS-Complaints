K821x#15complaint
Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
said Sunny  shouldnt have approved his later loans as he was locked in a debt cycle and he 
was using one loan to pay off another.

One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr G and Sunny said.  He thought  Mr Gs complaint 
should be partially upheld. He thought that Sunny had made  proportionate checks for loans 
1 to 3. So he thought  that Sunnys decisions to lend were reasonable. 
He didnt think that Sunny had made proportionate  checks for loans 4 to 11. He thought  if it 
had then it wouldnt have  agreed to lend Mr G money  for loans 5 to 11. This is because  he 
didnt think that Mr G could afford  the repayments.  And Sunny wouldve seen this had it 
completed better checks.  
Sunny partially  agreed with our adjudicator.  After  some further correspondence it said that it 
was prepared to uphold this complaint from loan 4 onwards  in the way our adjudicator 
recommended. 
However the offer Sunny made  did not include interest at 8% simple  on the fees and 
charges Mr G had paid. Sunny said that it didnt  agree with this part of the compensation as 
Mr G hadnt repaid all of the capital on his loans. 
As full agreement wasnt reached  the complaint has been passed  to me to issue a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN89025952Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Gs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Gs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
Mr G didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. And Sunny, in 
principal, also agreed  with what our adjudicator said about which loans it should, and 
shouldnt have approved. As I said earlier, Sunny agreed to uphold Mr Gs complaint about 
loans 4 to 11. 
Because of this I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  which  loans Mr G 
should receive compensation for. So I wont comment  further  on this. The area still in dispute 
is whether 8% interest  should  be added to the refunded fees, interest  and charges that 
should be repaid to Mr G. 
When I make a compensation award it should, as far as possible, put the consumer back 
into the positon they would be in had the business not made  the mistake it did. So as its 
now agreed that Sunny shouldnt have approved some of the loans then Mr G wouldnt have 
paid the associated interest,  fees or charges on them. So to compensate  Mr G, Sunny 
should return these.  As Mr G paid this money  some  time ago, and has not had the use of it 
since this time, then interest  at the rate of 8% simple should  be added  to these amounts to 
compensate him for this delay. 
From what  I can see Sunnys offer didnt contain interest at the rate of 8% simple on the 
fees, interest  and charges that it was refunding to Mr G. I dont think  this is right and it isnt in 
line with our established approach to how we compensate  consumers where a lender  has 
irresponsibly lent. 
I agree  that where Mr G has repaid less than the actual  loan amount  then Sunny  may not 
need to add any interest. I understand this applies to loans 6, 7, 9 and 11. Sunny should 
recalculate these loans to find out if Mr G paid more, or less, than the amount he borrowed.  
If Mr G has paid less than he borrowed for these loans then Sunny should reduce the 
amount he owes by the amount he actually  paid. If Mr G has paid more than the amount he 
borrowed then Sunny should  return these  overpayments, plus interest at 8% simple  from the 
times Mr G paid more than he borrowed to the time the compensation is paid. 
For clarity Ive detailed below how Sunny should  pay compensation to Mr G. 
what Sunny should  do to put things right
To fairly compensate Mr G sunny should:
add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr G towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans 4, 5, 8 and 10 
add 8% simple interest* to the above amounts from the date Mr G originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled
remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balances on loans 6, 7, 9 and 11, and 
treat any repayments made by Mr G as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on these  loans
Ref: DRN89025953if this results in Mr G having paid more  than he borrowed on any of the loans then 
Sunny should  refund  these overpayments  with 8% simple interest* from the date the 
overpayments were  made to the date the complaint is settled 
if there is still an outstanding balance on any of loans 6, 7, 9 and 11 then Sunny  can 
deduct this from the remainder of the compensation. 
remove any adverse information  you have recorded on Mr Gs credit  file in relation to 
loans 4 to 11
if Sunny  no longer  owns any of the outstanding debt, and it wants  to make a 
deduction due to the amount owed,  then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt 
entitled to make  any deductions  for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr G
*HM Revenue and Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should 
give Mr G a certificate showing how much  tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
