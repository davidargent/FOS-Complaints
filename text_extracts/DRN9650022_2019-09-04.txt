K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
QuickQuid approved one loan for Mr D in July 2011 for £400  repayable  53 days  later with a 
£100 payment  due on 29 July 2011 followed by £500 on 26 August 2011. It was extended in 
August 2011 and after September 2011  Mr D made  no repayments.  
QuickQuid corresponded with Mr D about  the debt and in January 2012  it emailed  Mr D to 
say that it had sold his debt to a third party collection agency.  QuickQuid says that there  is 
an outstanding  balance.  
Our adjudicator looked at this complaint and she did not think that QuickQuid had done 
anything wrong. QuickQuid has made no response so I take this to mean  that QuickQuid is 
content with the adjudicators view. 
Mr D disagreed. A different adjudicator reviewed the complaint and invited Mr D to send  to 
us information  about his financial  circumstances  around July 2011. Nothing has been 
received. 
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ds case. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ds income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.
QuickQuid had information from Mr D that he was employed, rented his accommodation and 
his monthly net income was £1,500. 
It carried out credit bureau checks as well. I have  not received  the results  of those. But for 
Mr D as a new customer with a first loan then I would  not have expected QuickQuid to have 
done more than it did.
I do not uphold  Mr Ds complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Ref: DRN96500222Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 October  2019.
