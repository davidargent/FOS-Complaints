K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA limited access  to her account.  And it 
wont let her use its services any more.
background
Miss M said PayPal had permanently limited  her account. She thinks  its because  shed 
opened too many disputes about  items shed received. Miss M says she makes a lot of 
purchases. So its inevitable thered be some problems. PayPal claimed itd sent her a 
warning email. But Miss M never received it. 
Miss M said she was told the limit was only on her account not on her as a person. But when 
she opened a new account it was linked  to her limited account. And she was also unable  to 
use her debit cards as a guest. So she wants  PayPal to remove the limitation  on her 
account and allow her to use its services.
PayPal said itd emailed  Mrs M on 23 May 2018.  Shed raised  a large  number of disputes 
about items not arriving or not being as described.  This was part of the risk of buying items 
online. But Ms Ms dispute  rate was higher than normal. Miss M subsequently claimed she 
hadnt received  three of the next five items  shed purchased. So itd limited her account. 
After Miss M got in touch PayPal discovered she was underage when shed signed the user 
agreement. But shed ticked the option  to confirm she was 18. Miss M had breached the 
terms of use. And regardless of the number of claims thatd occurred PayPal was prohibited 
from restoring access to the account.
Miss M wasnt  satisfied with PayPals response. So she contacted  our service and our 
investigator looked into the matter. She thought PayPal had tried to let Miss M know the 
account had been limited  due to the number of disputes raised. And Miss M wasnt 18 when 
the account had been opened. So the terms of the user agreement had been breached. And 
our investigator felt PayPal hadnt acted unfairly  in closing the account.
Miss M didnt agree. PayPal had allowed her to open the account even though shed 
provided the correct  date of birth. And shed  never  received the email  warning  about  the 
number of claims. So shes asked for an ombudsmans  final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   I can understand how upsetting  this has 
been for Miss M. So Ive looked  at everything thats  happened to see if PayPal has done 
anything wrong. And if so what  it needs to do to put things right.
Miss M has raised  a number of other issues during  the complaint. Ive carefully considered  
the points shes  raised  and PayPals responses. But Ive focused my decision on the issues 
that are relevant  to the outcome. 
Miss M says she didnt receive PayPals email in June  2018 about her dispute  activity. Shed 
had no problems receiving other  messages. And shed  have  changed how she used her 
account if shed  known. Ive seen a copy of PayPals message.  And Ive no reason to believe 
it wasnt sent. 
Ref: DRN57860752When Miss M contacted  PayPal it became clear the account had been opened before she 
was 18. And therefore, regardless of the issue relating to her disputes,  PayPal said it 
couldnt restore the account.
I know Miss M says she wasnt aware of the need  to be 18 when she opened the account. 
And she wouldnt knowingly have  given false information. But regardless of what  information  
was entered it was still a breach of the terms of the agreement.  Section  1.7 states the 
applicant must be at least 18 years old to be eligible  for its services.  
In October  2018 Miss M says she was told the limitation was only on her account  not on 
her individually. But shes not been able to set up a new account or use a guest login to 
make payments. And it seems the business  relationship between Miss M and PayPal has 
broken down. 
PayPal has sent messages  to Miss M to advise the limitation on her new account  is now 
permanent. Just as Miss M can decide to change to another service,  PayPal can decide 
which customers it wants to do business  with. PayPal was concerned about how Miss M was 
using her account. And its decided it no longer wishes to process payments on Miss Ms 
behalf through either an account or guest checkout.  
Miss M doesnt feel she did anything wrong  when she opened the account  while  still under 
18 or how she used the account. She didnt  think raising disputes  would be a problem as 
each dispute wouldve  been investigated  by PayPal itself. And she feels PayPals  terms are 
open to interpretation and subjective.  But the user agreement  allows  PayPal to close an 
account or limit access to its services if theres been  a breach of the terms. And the breach 
can include  what it considers acceptable use.
Ive looked very carefully at everything Miss M has said. And I do appreciate how upsetting 
this mustve been. Ive no reason to believe it didnt  send the message about her dispute  
activity. But Ive not seen anything to suggest PayPal believes Miss M has raised fraudulent  
claims. 
After a review PayPal made a business  decision to end its relationship  with Miss M. But how 
PayPal conducts  a review  and the sort of things it looks  at is commercially sensitive. So 
thats not something I can ask PayPal to provide more information  on. 
I know Miss M will be disappointed with this outcome. But PayPal has acted within the terms 
of the agreement Miss M accepted when  she opened her account.  Based on what Ive seen I 
cant really say PayPal has done anything wrong. And I wont be asking it to do anything  
more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 September 2019.
