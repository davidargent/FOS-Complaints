K820x#14complaint
Mr P has complained that National  Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to take a 
payment for a debt owed on his current account and recorded adverse data on his credit file.
background
Mr P had a current account with NatWest. In 2018 he switched his account to a different 
bank. But as Mr P had an outstanding overdraft on the account,  he was told he needed to 
pay it back.
Mr P has experienced a number of issues making payments to the account  since  then, 
which are the subject of several complaints with our service.
Mr P had a repayment plan in place where he needed  to pay £84.50 to the account by the 
1st of each  month. In February  2019, Mr P tried to make a payment through  NatWests online 
payment portal. However, he couldnt  set this up. So, he called NatWest to complain.  He 
thought NatWest was putting barriers in place  to ensure the account  would be defaulted. 
Mr P felt the balance should be written off due to the number of issues  hed experienced 
since he switched the account.
NatWest investigated  Mr Ps concerns and established the problem with the payment  was 
because Mr P was entering his surname with a hyphen.  It said the portal  guidelines 
explained that hyphens shouldnt be entered. While it appreciated Mr P was frustrated,  
NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong. It also noted that Mr P had used abusive 
language to a staff member, which it thought was unacceptable.
Mr P referred his complaint to our service. Although hed since managed to make a payment 
to the account,  hed set up a future payment arrangement on the portal on 22 February 2019 
for a payment  to be made on 1st March  2019 and thereafter. However, the payment hadnt 
been taken and he wished to add this to his complaint.
NatWest said it had attempted to take the payment but this had been refused by Mr Ps 
bank. Mr P said his bank couldnt  see that NatWest had attempted to take any payment. So 
he believed  NatWest as at fault.
As Mr P hadnt made the payment in time,  NatWest  said the repayment plan had been 
broken and would need  to be restarted. Mr P received several  letters from NatWest in 
March 2019 about the status of the account,  one of which  said charges would be applied   
he felt NatWest was harassing him.
Our investigator considered the complaint  but wasnt able to establish  why the payment Mr P 
set up didnt go through. She thought Mr P shouldve made alternative arrangements  to 
make the payment in time. As he didnt, she didnt  think the letters  NatWest  sent about the 
account were unreasonable. However, she didnt  think Mr P should have to pay any charges 
for breaking  the repayment plan.
NatWest explained  that because Mr Ps account  was switched out, it wasnt  subject to any 
charges or interest. So, no charges would be applied, despite what  the letters said. It said 
Mr P would need to set up a regular payment from 1 May 2019.
Ref: DRN86355092The investigator relayed  this to Mr P, but he was unhappy with the resolution. He said 
NatWest had reported to the credit reference agencies  that hed failed to make  a payment 
and that a new arrangement had been  put in place. He thought  this was unfair because 
NatWest hadnt  taken the payment on 1 March 2019. 
The investigator thought Mr P had been  given an opportunity  to make a payment before  
NatWest took any action. As he didnt, the repayment plan was broken and it was 
reasonable for NatWest to report this to the credit  reference agencies.
Mr P disagreed so the complaint was referred  to me to make a final decision.
I asked both Mr P and NatWest for further  information about the payment arrangement Mr P 
had set up on 22 February 2019. NatWest provided  evidence showing it had attempted  to 
take a payment of £84.50  on 22 February 2019 but this had been refused by Mr Ps bank. 
Mr P provided evidence from his bank  that they couldnt find any trace of NatWest  
attempting to take any payment from his account between 22 February  and 1 March 2019.
I told Mr P that I didnt think there was sufficient evidence to conclude  that either party was at 
fault. However, Mr P maintained that the blame lay with NatWest.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding it.
Its been difficult to establish  what went wrong with the payment Mr P set up on 
22 February 2019. As Ive said above, NatWest  provided records  showing that it attempted 
to take a payment of £84.50 on 22 February  2019  but this was refused by his bank. 
However, this is at odds  with the evidence Mr Ps sent us and what he said he did.
Mr P told us that he set up a future  payment arrangement on 22 February  2019  for a 
payment of £84.50 to be taken on 1st March 2019  and each month thereafter. He sent us a 
screenshot showing this. However, the screenshot says:
Thank you, your payment  was successful and your FuturePay  agreement  has been  set up.
I said to Mr P that it looked  like hed made  the first payment of £84.50 on 22 February 2019, 
which matched NatWests record that it had tried to take the payment on that date.  However, 
Mr P said he definitely set the first payment to be taken on 1 March 2019. He thought  that 
the reference to a payment being successful was most likely an active  card check, which  
hed seen had taken place in April when he successfully set up his future  payment 
arrangement. He said no such check appeared to have taken place in February 2019. Again 
he thought this pointed to an error with NatWests  payment system.
Having taken all of this into account,  it still isnt clear  what  happened with Mr Ps payment 
arrangement. But I do think its possible there  was an issue with NatWests payment system, 
not least because  the screenshot Mr P has sent us said the payment was successful, when 
NatWests records show it wasnt.
Nevertheless, I can see Mr P knew his payment hadnt been  made  on 1 March 2019  as he 
discussed this with NatWest on the phone that day. NatWest has provided  the notes made 
about this call. They say Mr P was told that he needed to make the payment on that day or 
Ref: DRN86355093within the next couple of days otherwise he would be breaking the repayment plan. He was 
asked if he wanted  to make a payment  by card, but Mr P declined  to do this and said it 
wasnt convenient.
Mr P told us he was abroad at the time and only had his credit card; he said he had more 
important matters to deal with than making  the payment. But I think he was made aware of 
the consequences of not making the payment in time. NatWest  didnt  take any action with 
the account until 9 March  2019, so I still think he had the opportunity  to make  the payment 
before the repayment plan was recorded  as having  been broken. Although  he was in contact 
with our service, it doesnt appear  Mr P contacted NatWest about  things  until 
28 March 2019,  despite knowing he hadnt made  any other arrangements  to pay.
I know Mr P feels very strongly  that NatWest has treated  him unfairly.  I also appreciate  that 
hes had difficulties with the online payment system and he clearly attempted  to set up an 
ongoing payment  arrangement.  But Im also mindful that NatWest told Mr P that there were 
several ways he could pay. He couldve called the collections team to make  a payment over 
the phone, or used the automated service.  I accept Mr P preferred to make  payments online, 
but I still wouldve  expected Mr P to make every  effort to pay the agreed  sum in time to avoid 
the repayment plan being broken.
Mr P was told on 1 March 2019 that he needed to make a payment as soon as possible to 
avoid the repayment plan being broken. As he didnt  make alternative arrangements, I dont 
think it was unreasonable for NatWest to record the repayment plan as having been  broken.
I know Mr P will be very disappointed with this, but I dont think NatWest needs  to do 
anything to put things right on this occasion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
