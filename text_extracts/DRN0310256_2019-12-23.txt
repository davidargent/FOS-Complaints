K821x#15complaint
Mr P has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA is holding  him liable for transactions 
from his PayPal account which he didnt authorise.
background
In March 2018 after a series of emails and attempted  contacts from PayPal, Mr P reviewed 
his PayPal account to see a series  of transactions over two days  that he didnt make. Most 
of these transactions had been paid using his credit card. He got his credit  card company to 
raise chargebacks.  These were all successful.
PayPal were holding  Mr P liable for nearly  £4,000  of transactions.  They  engaged a third 
party debt collector  to get payment from Mr P. Mr P brought his complaint to the ombudsman 
service as PayPal wouldnt accept he hadnt  made these transactions.
Our investigator reviewed  the evidence. He specifically requested  IP address  information 
from PayPal to help evidence where  these  transactions happened. PayPal was unwilling to 
provide login information for these transactions. He found Mr Ps evidence  to be credible and 
felt he hadnt made  or authorised these transactions. He asked PayPal to stop pursuing Mr P 
for the debt and pay him compensation for the inconvenience caused.
PayPal believed it was possible  Mr P had allowed someone else to use his PayPal account.  
Theyve asked an ombudsman to review  this complaint. This case  has been passed to me 
to consider.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator  and for roughly the same  reasons. Ill explain why.
The Payment Services Regulations primarily  require financial institutions to refund 
customers if they didnt  make or authorise payments themselves. Certain other  
circumstances do apply   but nothing that specifically has a bearing  in Mr Ps case.  So when 
we look at whether  PayPal has acted fairly  in rejecting someones  fraud  complaint, one of 
the things we consider is whether the customer made the transactions  themselves or 
allowed them to be made. If they did, then we generally wouldnt ask PayPal to refund them.
To help me decide what happened, Ive looked at the evidence  of the transactions 
themselves (which weve sought from both PayPal and Mr Ps credit card company) and the 
evidence presented to us by Mr P. 
Firstly I can see the timeline of events and the different scenarios around who may have 
authorised these transactions in March  2018 were comprehensively covered in our 
investigators view of 22 November 2019.  I dont intend to repeat everything that was said 
there. Except to say Im satisfied Ive reviewed the complaint thoroughly.
Ref: DRN03102562The issues  I think are pertinent to this complaint include:
10 financial transactions were conducted  across Mr Ps PayPal account on 1 and 2 
March 2018 for relatively large-value transactions. Mr P has no history  of using his 
PayPal account  in this way;
The correct  PayPal  account login details were  used. Theres  no evidence Mr P shared 
these with anybody  or allowed anybody to use his account;
In my experience security around  PayPal accounts is not insurmountable;
There is no evidence  to show Mr Ps IP address  was used for these 10 transactions;
There is no evidence  that genuine  goods  or services were supplied  to Mr P;
When Mr Ps credit card company attempted chargebacks  for the majority  of these 
transactions, none of these were disputed; and
If these merchants  had been  genuine, I wouldnt have expected this to be the case;
In the absence of any evidence to the contrary I can only conclude  that Mr P didnt make  or 
authorise these transactions. PayPal therefore  cannot ask Mr P to pay for these transactions 
and will need to write off the debt. 
Its clear Mr P was taken aback by what has happened and has spent a good deal of time 
trying to see who did this and how this could have  happened.  Like our investigator I think its 
fair he gets paid compensation  for this inconvenience. I believe £150 is a fair amount.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Write off any debt theyre  asking Mr P to pay;
Make sure theres no adverse data on his credit record relating to this amount; and
Pay Mr P £150 for the inconvenience  caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
