K821x#15Complaint
Mr C complains Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr C took eight loans  from Sunny between June 2016 and December 2017. Ive included  
some of the information  weve  received  about  these loans in the table below. Sometimes the 
loans overlapped with one another. Where this was the case  the repayment column  shows 
the combined amount Mr C needed  to pay monthly across all his outstanding loans.

All of the loans  were repaid by June 2018. Later,  Mr C complained to Sunny that it had lent 
to him irresponsibly. Sunny didnt agree, so Mr C asked  this service to carry out an 
independent review of his complaint. An adjudicator looked into the complaint and concluded 
Sunny had been wrong to give Mr C loans 6 to 8. Sunny responded to say that on reflection  
it didnt think it should have given Mr C loans 7 or 8, but that it didnt agree that it had been 
wrong to give him loan 6. It made an offer,  which Mr C didnt reply to.
As no agreement could be reached, the case was passed to me to decide.
Prior to writing this decision  I contacted Mr C to explain that I shared Sunnys view that it 
hadnt been wrong to give him loan 6, but that I agreed it shouldnt  have given  him loans 7 
or 8. I asked Mr C if he wanted to accept Sunnys offer and invited  him to submit further 
points in relation  to his other  loans,  but he has not replied.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Mr Cs applications  for borrowing to check  if he could afford  to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN63992652But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr C. These factors include:
Mr C having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being  especially high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult 
to meet a higher  repayment from a particular level of income);  
Mr C having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr C coming back for loans shortly  after previous  borrowing had been repaid  (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming  unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr C.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money to 
make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator  that Mr C was able to repay his loans 
sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. The FCAs Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having  to borrow to make  them.  If a lender realises, or ought reasonably  to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should  conclude those  repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Cs complaint.
I dont think Sunny had any reason to suspect  that its lending to Mr C might  have been 
unsustainable for the first few loans it gave  him, or that its checks might not have been 
proportionate. The loans were not in general  very big compared to his monthly income,  there 
was nothing in his repayment history  to suggest he was struggling, and the results  of 
Sunnys credit checks did not reveal anything which I think  should  have  concerned a 
responsible lender operating in the short-term high-cost sphere. It follows that I dont think  
Sunny was irresponsible to give Mr C these loans.
I think Sunny  should have  been asking Mr C some more detailed  questions about his 
financial situation by the time he applied for loan 5. This isnt because he had any obvious 
issues repaying his loans, but I think  a responsible lender should  have  questioned  why he 
kept on returning for loans of similar amounts  over a fairly long period of time, bearing in 
mind the fact that the kind of borrowing offered was meant to be of a short-term nature. I 
think there was at least a suggestion of an underlying problem which Sunny ought to have 
tried to get to the bottom of. However,  Ive been unable to reconstruct what Sunny would 
have seen had it carried out more detailed  enquiries, because Mr C hasnt provided more 
information to this service  about his financial situation at the time.  So I dont think theres 
enough evidence  to say Sunny was wrong to give Mr C loan 5. 
Ref: DRN63992653I take the same view for loan 6. Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldnt have given this 
loan to Mr C because the pattern of borrowing was in itself by this point suggestive  of him 
being persistently  reliant on short-term loans, but I think its a little too early to come  to that 
conclusion in this case. Mr C tended to leave a few months between applying  for new loans, 
which isnt a pattern  Id normally associate  with unsustainable lending.  Because there were 
reasonable lengths of time between  loan applications I think a little longer was needed  to 
establish a clearly unsustainable  pattern of borrowing. 
When Mr C applied for loan 7, loans 5 and 6 were still running. This was the first (and only) 
time Mr C had three loans  running  simultaneously, and he was expected to pay over £300 in 
a single month. Hed told Sunny that his income was £1,400 per month and Sunny had 
calculated his monthly expenditure was £1,220. So based on Sunnys own analysis Mr C 
didnt have enough money  available  to make his repayments. As loan 7 was unaffordable for 
Mr C I dont think it was right of Sunny to agree it.
For loan 8, I take into account  the fact Mr C didnt apply for this until four months after he 
applied for loan 7. But loan 7 was still running  and Mr C had been in debt to Sunny now 
almost continuously  for over 18 months. The amounts  he was borrowing hadnt  been 
decreasing either. Overall  the circumstances suggested he was regularly running short of 
money and had a long-term borrowing need for which loans  of the type offered by Sunny are 
not suitable. I think Sunny should have  suspected  Mr C was unable  to make his repayments 
in a sustainable way, and not granted loan 8.
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr C loans 7 or 8, so its not right that he should  have had to 
pay interest, fees or charges in relation to these loans, or have them  affect his credit file in a 
negative way. So to put things right Sunny must:
A)Add together the total of the repayments  made by Mr C towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans.
B)Calculate  8% simple  interest* on the individual  payments made  by Mr C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr C originally made the payments, 
to the date the complaint  is settled.
C)Pay Mr C the total of A plus B.
D)Remove any adverse  information relating to the loans from Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN63992654My final decision
For the reasons  explained above I uphold Mr Cs complaint in part and direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) to take the actions  outlined in the putting things 
right section of this final decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 April 2020.
