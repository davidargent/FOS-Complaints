The complaint
Mr T complains about the service he received from Barclays Bank UK Plc after he opened 
an account.
What happened
Mr T had previously complained about other aspects of service he had received from 
Barclays.  That complaint was looked at by another ombudsman.  This complaint is about 
the following issues:
-it took 5 months to obtain basic account information to allow payments in
and out of the account;
-the restricted opening times of the team Mr T wished to speak to made it hard for him 
to contact them
-the customer service team at Barclays gave him the incorrect opening times and then 
refused to provide him with the contact number;
-his request to have information sent to him via post or secure message was not 
accepted
-
Mr T says as a result of all these delays, he had delayed access to his funds.
Barclays accepted it could have done more for Mr T and offered him £150 for the poor 
service  but Mr T did not accept this and came to our service.
Our investigator did not think she could ask Barclays to do anymore.  Mr T thought £500 
would be a fair sum for the inconvenience he has suffered and so he asked for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid I wont be asking Barclays to do anymore here either.
Ive looked carefully at what Mr T has had to say about his complaint and it is accepted that 
Barclays could have done better in the service it offered. But the investigator is right  £150 
is a fair and reasonable figure for the inconvenience Mr T has suffered and I wont be asking 
for it to be increased.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2020.
