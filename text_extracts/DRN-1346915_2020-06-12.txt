Complaint 
Mr M complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent 
irresponsibly to him. 
Background 
Between January 2015 and November 2015, Mr M borrowed 12 loans from Sunny. His 
borrowing history is as follows:

It appears to me that there may be an outstanding balance in respect of loan 12. I 
understand Sunny offered to uphold the complaint in respect of loans 11 and 12. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in respect of loans 6 to 12. He 
thought that by loan 6, Sunny should have realised that the pattern of Mr Ms borrowing was 
harmful. Sunny disagreed with that view. It said that it was too early in the lending 
relationship for our adjudicator to say Mr M was dependent on its loans. 
DRN-1346915As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
My findings 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Neither party disagreed with what our 
adjudicator said about loans 1 to 5. So I havent considered further whether Sunny was 
irresponsible to agree those loans. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of the ending history with a view to seeing if there was a 
point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that point was reached, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I agree with our adjudicator that this point 
was reached by loan 6. I say this because: 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. He had taken out 6 loans within 6 months. Sunny should have realised it 
was more likely that Mr M was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving his finances. It should have been clear that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Ms first loan was for £300 and by the time he borrowed loan 6, Mr M had 
outstanding loans of over £800.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr M 
was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out 10 months after Mr Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr M had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards and these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
The number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint loans 6 to 12 and Sunny will need to take action to put 
things right for Mr M. Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr M loans 6 to 12. I understand there may be an outstanding 
debt. If Sunny has sold that debt, it must buy it back if it is able to do so. If it is not able to 
buy the debt back, it must liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined 
below: 
a) Sunny must add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything that
has already been refunded;
b) Sunny must calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M
which were considered as part of paragraph (a) from the date Mr M originally made the
payments to the date the complaint is settled;
c) Sunny must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr M as though they had been
repayments of principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr M having made
overpayments, Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8%* simple interest calculated
on the overpayments from the date the overpayments would have arisen to the date the
complaint is settled. It must then refund the amounts calculated in paragraphs (a) and (b)
and move to step (e);
d) If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in (a) and (b) should
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus,
then the surplus must be repaid to Mr M. However, if there is still an outstanding balance,
Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr M. It must not pursue
outstanding balances made up of principal it has already written off;
e) The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing for loans 6 to 12 means any information recorded
about them is adverse. Sunny must remove these loans entirely from Mr Ms credit file. It
does not have to remove loans 6 to 12 from the credit file until they have been paid. But it
must remove any adverse information recorded about them.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision 
For the reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint and Elevate Credit International 
Limited must put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
