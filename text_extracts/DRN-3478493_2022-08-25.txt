The complaint
Miss S complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Aqua, irresponsibly granted her 
credit that she couldnt afford to repay.
 
What happened
NewDay approved a credit card application for Miss S in August 2016. They initially provided 
a credit limit of £300 but the limit was progressively increased until it reached £5,650 in May 
2019.
Miss S says they were wrong to provide credit as it wasnt affordable for her.
NewDay disagree. They say that when they approved the credit card application they 
reviewed Miss Ss credit file and found she had no arrears, no County Court judgements, 
and no pay day loans or defaults. They noted there was £12,500 of unsecured debt but 
considering Miss S had told them she was living with her parents and earning about £15,000 
per year they thought the card with an initial credit limit of £300 was affordable for her.
And when NewDay increased the credit limits they said their risk and affordability data 
showed Miss S had been managing her account quite well with only one payment fee and 
some high value payments being made to clear the debt. They noted that there had been 
some instances where Miss S had relied on cash withdrawals from her credit card account 
prior to the last limit increase but that her reliance on payday loans had reduced with non 
being taken out since July 2017. They thought the credit limit increases were therefore 
affordable.
Our investigator thought that NewDay shouldnt have approved the card application and 
suggested NewDay should take some action to remedy the situation. But as NewDay 
disagreed the complaint has been referred to me, an ombudsman, for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Account opening.
I dont think NewDay completed proportionate checks before approving the credit card. They 
reviewed Miss Ss credit file and gathered some information from her about her income and 
circumstances. That information showed Miss S was on a low income and already had 
significant unsecured debt showing on her credit file. I think NewDay should have completed 
further checks before approving the card in order to clarify Miss Ss income and expenditure.
I think it would have been proportionate for NewDay to have verified Miss Ss financial 
circumstances. One way NewDay could have done this was by requesting copies of her 
bank statements. Ive reviewed three months of bank statements leading up to the lending 
decision. 
The statements show that Miss S declared income was wrong. At the time of application her 
income was much lower than shed declared to NewDay and only about £7,000 a year. Her 
account was regularly in significant overdraft and there was more coming out than was going 
in. This demonstrates that Miss S didnt have enough disposable income to afford the 
additional borrowing. I think its likely proportionate checks would have revealed this to 
NewDay, it therefore didnt act fairly by approving the credit card.
The subsequent limit increases
As Ive not been persuaded that NewDay should have provided the card in the first place I 
dont think the limit increases can also be considered affordable. NewDay hadnt completed 
proportionate checks to assure themselves of Miss Ss income and expenditure and if they 
had they would likely have discovered the card and all subsequent limit increases were 
unaffordable for her.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Miss S should 
pay back the amounts she has borrowed. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest, fees, charges, and insurances (which have 
not already been refunded) that have been applied. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Miss S along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Miss Ss credit file. 
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with Miss S for the remaining amount. Once Miss S 
has cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be 
removed from her credit file. 
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. 
It must give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for 
one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put things right in the manner set out 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept or reject my decision before 22 September 2022.
