The complaint
Mr M complains Paypal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) reversed two credits he received 
into his account.
What happened
In June 2019, Mr M accepted a booking for his holiday rental property. He says the buyer 
paid an initial deposit of £100 to his PayPal account before the balance and a security 
deposit totalling £1150 was paid six weeks later.
In August 2019, PayPal said the payments Mr M received had been made without the 
sending account holders permission. After completing their review, they reversed the 
transactions from Mr Ms account.
Mr M raised a complaint disagreeing the transactions were unauthorised. He said the buyer 
had arrived to start their holiday but due to a dispute regarding the property, had only stayed 
one night.
PayPal said Mr M had accepted the payments using their Friends and Family option, so he 
was ineligible for seller protection. And because, after completing their investigation, theyd 
accepted the transactions were unauthorised his account had been debited.
PayPal did however acknowledge the level of service Mr M had received hadnt been that 
which they strive to deliver so they offered him £100 by way of an apology.
Mr M remained unhappy, so referred his complaint to our service. One of our investigators 
looked into things but because of the type of payments Mr M had accepted, she felt PayPal 
acted fairly by reversing them.
Our investigator also felt PayPals offer of compensation for the poor service Mr M had 
received was fair, so she said she wasnt going to ask PayPal to do anything more. Mr M 
asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint, so the case has been passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After reviewing the complaint, I didnt agree with our investigator. So I issued a provisional 
decision on 31 January 2022. In this I said:
Firstly, I can confirm I have reviewed PayPals user agreement which covers both buyer and 
seller protection and the eligibility criteria they set out.
It isnt in dispute Mr M, as a seller, received money in exchange for the rental of his holiday 
property. And because the sender sent both transactions to Mr M as Friends and family 
payments, he didnt benefit from PayPals seller protection  nor did the buyer benefit from 
buyer protection.
But in this case the buyer raised the payments as being unauthorised and PayPal, after 
conducting their standard investigation, accepted the claim. Because Mr M wasnt eligible for 
seller protection the funds were reversed from his account.
Its important to say I dont disagree Mr M wasnt eligible for seller protection. And PayPal 
are entitled to apply the terms and conditions Mr M signed up to. But I need to be satisfied 
that PayPal not just applied the terms and conditions but did so reasonably and fairly in the 
circumstances of this specific complaint. Ive not been persuaded they did.
PayPals user agreement says in the event of an unauthorised claim being made the 
claimant must give them all the information reasonably requested as to the circumstances of 
the problem and take all reasonable steps requested to assist them in their investigation.
PayPal have said they conducted their standard investigation before accepting the payments 
were unauthorised. They told our investigator this involved a review of the senders account 
activity, such as the location, device and IP address used when making the payments along 
with their previous history of transacting on their platform.
Ive asked to see, in confidence, the investigation completed. But unfortunately, PayPal is 
unwilling to share the evidence they reviewed with us. So, Im unable to fairly satisfy myself 
whether the senders account was compromised, or if Mr M was the unfortunate victim of a 
scam. Or if the sender themselves raised the payments as unauthorised in order to retrieve 
their funds after becoming involved in a dispute about the standard of Mr Ms property  an 
event they werent covered for being ineligible for buyer protection.
Im also of the opinion Mr M has provided a consistent and plausible testimony throughout. 
Contacting PayPal within 90 minutes of first being notified there was an issue, Mr M provided 
evidence of his conversations with the buyer both before the payments were sent and after, 
culminating in a dispute between himself and the buyer.
PayPal have told me their process specifically does not request evidence from the seller as 
they cannot consider such evidence. They also dont consider anything provided by Mr M to 
be actual evidence. But Im not satisfied this is the case. 
Ive asked PayPal for sight of their investigation process, but Ive not been provided this. And 
I dont think it feels fair for PayPal to have dismissed the evidence Mr M provided, promptly 
after the claim was raised, without consideration. 
Had PayPal taken into account the evidence provided I think they wouldve seen that the 
initial deposit payment of £100 was paid some seven weeks before, and the remaining 
balance seven days before the buyers agreed arrival date at the property. However, it was 
only after a dispute about the property, and Mr Ms refusal to refund the buyer for their stay, 
that the unauthorised transaction claim was raised.
Mr M has also said when he spoke with PayPal soon after the claim was raised, PayPal 
agreed the buyer was complaining about the product so there was no denying they knew 
what they were paying for. Ive asked for a copy of any call recordings regarding the dispute, 
but Ive not been provided these.
The information Ive requested but not received would have a bearing on whether I think 
PayPal acted fairly when accepting the unauthorised transaction claim and, as a direct result 
of this then reversing the payments from Mr Ms account.
In the absence of this information, I have considered what our rules allow. The Financial 
Conduct Authority Handbook on Dispute Resolution: DISP 3.5.9 states: The Ombudsman 
may: (3) reach a decision on the basis of what has been supplied and take account of the 
failure by a party to provide information requested;
Taking everything into account Im not presently satisfied PayPal acted fairly in taking the 
actions they did, and I think they need to take action to put things right.PayPal has also previously offered Mr M £100 in recognition for the disparity between the 
level of customer service it provided and that which it strives to deliver. I think this is a fair 
and reasonable resolution to reflect the service provided considering the circumstances of 
this complaint.
Mr M had nothing to add, but PayPal didnt agree with my provisional decision. Ive 
considered their comments, but my decision remains the same. Ill explain why.
PayPal point to my acknowledgement that Mr M wasnt covered by their seller protection 
because he received the payments as personal payments. PayPal say they cannot cover a 
seller if payments are received this way and their decision to reserve the payments was 
correct in line with their user agreement.
Whilst PayPal have said they understand my point of view, they need to look at the account 
and make a decision in line with their user agreement. 
But as Ive said, my role is to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
case. I agree PayPal are entitled to apply the terms and conditions Mr M signed up to. But I 
need to be satisfied they did so both fairly and reasonably in the specific circumstances of 
this case. It remains I dont think they did.
PayPal remain of the opinion they are unable to provide information about the standard 
investigation they conducted which, as a direct result of them accepting the payments were 
unauthorised, led to Mr Ms account being debited. But I dont agree.
Ive asked for details of the investigation PayPal say was completed. I provided reassurance 
any information provided will be done so in strict confidence and will not be disclosed to any 
parties outside of this service. I also gave PayPal the option of redacting information 
sensitive to the sender. But Ive not been provided anything to persuade me the actions 
PayPal have taken led to a fair and reasonable decision being made to remove funds from 
Mr Ms account.
Because of this, and for the reasons explained in my provisional decision, I havent seen 
anything that would change my mind and my final decision is that this complaint should be 
upheld.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay £1,250 to Mr M, putting him back into the position he wouldve been in 
had they not reversed the transactions in question from his account. 
PayPal should also pay 8% simple interest on the amounts from the dates the payments 
were removed from Mr Ms account until the date of settlement. If PayPal deducts tax from 
the interest element of this award, it should provide Mr M with the appropriate tax deduction 
certificate.
PayPal should also pay compensation of £100 in recognition for the disparity between the 
level of customer service it provided and that which it strives to deliver  if it hasnt done so 
already.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, Ive decided to uphold this complaint and I direct Paypal 
Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to put things right as Ive detailed above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 March 2022.
