K820x#14complaint
Mr H on behalf of his business that I will call A complains that SumUp  Payments Limited 
unfairly closed his account and incorrectly told him he had asked for the account to be closed.
background
Mr H says he correctly set up the SumUp account  and provided it with all of the correct 
documentation. He says SumUp then closed the account without providing  him with a 
reason but told him that he had asked that the account be closed. Mr H says he didnt agree 
to any account  terms and conditions and would  like the account reopened and an apology 
for what happened.
SumUp says Mr H opened  the account  and agreed  to the account  terms and conditions. It says 
those terms and conditions allow it to close an account and so it hasnt  made a mistake here.
Mr H brought his complaint to us but our investigator  thought  SumUp  was entitled to close 
the account and had acted in line with the account terms and conditions. The investigator 
thought it was up to SumUp  to decide with whom  it had a business relationship.
Mr H doesnt accept  that view and has asked that it be reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for the same reasons. I realise Mr H will be disappointed by 
my decision.
Ive looked at SumUps records and can see that Mr H agreed  to the account terms and 
conditions when the account  was first opened.  I appreciate Mr H says he didnt agree to the 
terms and conditions but Im satisfied  that the account couldnt  have been opened unless he 
agreed to them. Having looked  at those terms and conditions I can see that SumUp  is 
entitled to close  an account. So I think thats  what happened  here and Im satisfied SumUp is 
entitled to make that decision  and hasnt made a mistake.
I accept that SumUp shouldnt have told Mr H that he had requested  that the account be 
closed and I also accept  that was a mistake. I appreciate that Mr H would have been 
frustrated in being told that but I dont think that affects the decision to close the account or 
justifies any compensation.
Im satisfied overall that SumUp  is entitled to close an account  and its up to it to decide with 
whom it has a business relationship. I think such matters are for a business  to decide upon  
and not something  I can fairly interfere in.
As I dont think SumUp has made  a mistake by closing the account I cant fairly order  it to 
reopen it or to do anything  further  in the circumstances of this complaint.
