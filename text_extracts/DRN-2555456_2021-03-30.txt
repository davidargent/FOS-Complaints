The complaint
Mr L complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) 
mismanaged his credit card account.
What happened
Mr L had a Barclaycard since 2006. The limit was increased by Barclaycard from £15,000 to 
£19,000 in January 2017. Mr L was in financial difficulty by 2019. Barclaycard suspended 
fees and interest for two periods in 2019, pending repayment discussions. In July 2019 they 
refunded fees and interest of £1127.99 as a goodwill gesture. Mr L offered to settle the debt 
by paying £8,000 and ask Barclaycard to write off the balance of £10,000. 
Mr L complained that his limit shouldnt have been increased by Barclaycard  he was in 
financial difficulty at the time and the increase was irresponsible. He hadnt used the card for 
purchases between 2007 and December 2017. When he tried to call them to discuss his 
situation in 2019, they didnt call him back as promised. He says he paid an excessive 
amount of interest  he said this amounted to £41,724 between 2006 and February 2019. 
Hed made an offer to settle the debt which theyd turned down. 
Barclaycard said the limit increase was made after Mr L passed their credit checks. These 
included information from credit reference agencies. Mr L was given the option of calling 
them to discuss the offer of the increase. They apologised that Mr l didnt get two call backs 
in 2019 as he was promised. In July 2019, they refunded fees and interest charged from 
March 2019  as a gesture of goodwill and pending discussions about a payment plan. This 
totalled £1127.99, plus £75 for distress and inconvenience. Interest and fees had been 
charged in line with their terms and conditions. They didnt want to accept Mr Ls offer to 
settle his debt with a payment of £8,000.
Mr L brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that under the services 
rules, we can only look at events within six years of Mr Ls complaint. Mr L complained in 
January 2020  so we can look at issues arising from January 2014. 
Limit increases: Barclaycard had told him that Mr L passed their credit checks. But he 
noted that the card wasnt used between 2013 and the limit increase in 2017. And 
only minimum payments (or close to them) were being made. There was evidence of 
late payments on other debts. He couldnt see that Barclaycard had made 
reasonable and proportionate checks before increasing the limit. He proposed that 
interest and fees charged on the debt over £15,000 should be refunded.
Fees and interest charges: he said that Barclaycard were entitled to charge fees and 
interest in line with its terms and conditions. The interest rates at various times were 
shown on Mr Ls statements. Barclaycard had told him that the only changes in 
interest rates were in line with changes to Bank of England base rate  and he could 
see that five changes were advised on Mr Ls statements.
Call not returned: these happened in February 2019 and April 2019. Barclaycard had agreed 
not to make charges between March 2019 and July 2019 to give Mr L time to work out his 
situation. Barclaycard told him that if the February 2019 call had gone ahead, this would 
likely have resulted in Mr L getting a further month free of interest and fees  so he said they 
should refund him for February 2019. He also noted that November 2019, a 72-month 
repayment plan was agreed at a reduced interest rate of 3%, which was subsequently 
reduced to 0%.
Mr Ls offer to settle: this was a commercial decision for Barclaycard to make.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I will look at Mr Ls complaints under four categories. 
Limit increases: I must consider whether Barclaycard acted in line within the Financial 
Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as set out in its handbook, (CONC) 
section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a reasonable assessment of 
creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer not making the repayments, 
as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make repayments.
Mr Ls limit was increased from £15,000 to £19,000 in January 2017. Mr L says this was 
irresponsible. He says he hadnt used his card since 2007 and he was in financial difficulty  
with several other debts. He accepts he couldve declined the offer of the increase, but didnt 
 and as a result, spent money he couldnt afford to repay. He was self  employed. 
Barclaycard say that he passed their credit checks at the time. This included data from 
external credit reference agencies. They told us that while they saw that Mr L had missed 
two payments to lenders in the previous six months, overall his other credit card debts had 
decreased from £32,882 in 2015 to £13,790 in January 2017. He hadnt missed any 
payments to his Barclaycard prior to the increase. Their analysis said Mr L had a low risk of 
default. He only started using the card for purchases again in December 2017  and then it 
appeared to be used for business expenditure which was against the terms and conditions of 
the card. An income and expenditure analysis was done in October 2020 which showed 
disposable income of £1,156 per month.
Ive thought about what both sides have said here.
I can see where Barclaycard are coming from and hear what theyve told us. I can see that 
their data shows total external credit card (and other debts) as coming down between 2015 
and 2017  but it was still high at £20,839 in December 2016 (when the limit increase was 
looked at and offered). And Mr L had a mortgage of £184,471 at the time. And  Ive looked 
at Mr Ls Barclaycard statements for the period from 2014 to the end of 2016. These show 
no use of the card at all  no purchases were made. Payments were met, but at or around 
the minimum level. So  this was basically a dormant account, except for interest and fees 
and the minimum payments. And the limit increase being offered was a large one  and the 
resulting credit limit of £19,000 was also significant  for a personal credit card. This 
suggests to me that Barclaycard shouldve checked more thoroughly to ensure they 
understood Mr Ls financial situation before offering the increase in limit. They told us that an 
income and expenditure analysis wasnt done at the time  other than that derived from the 
external affordability data. I note what Barclaycard said  that the card was later used for 
some of his (self-employed) business expenses  but as I see it, this shows that Mr L was in 
financial difficulty and needed to draw on his available credit limits to help his situation. 
So, on balance, I agree Barclaycard didnt make proportionate and reasonable inquiries 
before increasing Mr Ls limit from £15,000 to £19,000 in January 2017.Fees and interest charges: I agree with our investigator. These are set out in the terms and 
conditions  and also on Mr Ls statements. I can see that each monthly statement showed 
the monthly interest rate and any fees. So, Mr L has the chance to do something about the 
costs of his borrowing at the time. And in any case, the level of interest rates and fees are a 
commercial decision for Barclaycard - its not something this service can decide upon.
Calls not returned: Barclaycard admit they didnt return calls to Mr L as theyd promised to. 
Theyve apologised for this and refunded interest and fees for the period between March and 
July 2019. I agree that had the call in February 2019 gone ahead, they would quite probably 
agreed to cancel interest and charges for that month also  thats what Barclaycard have 
told us - so this should be done. 
Offer to settle: I agree with our investigator that this is a commercial issue and it is for 
Barclaycard and Mr L to discuss - its not something for this service to get involved in.
Putting things right
Limit increases: As my findings are that Barclaycard shouldnt have increased Mr Ls limit 
from £15,000 to £19,000 on 3 January 2017, they should refund all interest and charges 
relating to the borrowing over £15,000 from that date to the date of this decision. This should 
be adjusted for the refunds of interest and charges already made in July 2019  where those 
related to debt over £15,000.
Calls not returned: Barclaycard should refund interest and charges for the month of February 
2019.
Both refunds should be credited to Mr Ls Barclaycard account.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard must should: 
Refund all interest and charges relating to Mr Ls borrowing over £15,000 from 3 January 
2017 to the date of this decision. This should be adjusted for the refunds of interest and 
charges already made in July 2019  where those related to debt over £15,000.
Refund interest and charges for the month of February 2019.
Both refunds should be credited to Mr Ls Barclaycard credit card account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2021.
