The complaint
Mr N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to carry out his 
instructions to cancel his direct debit.
What happened
Mr N says during a meeting regarding his mortgage arrangements, with a member of 
NatWest staff, it was agreed his direct debit for his life insurance would be cancelled as a 
new life insurance policy was being arranged. Almost two years later in October 2020, Mr N 
says he noticed the premiums for his old life policy were still being taken from his bank 
account with NatWest. When Mr N raised this with NatWest, they accepted their mistake and 
refunded the premiums he had paid, plus a payment of £100 by way of compensation for 
their error. The following month NatWest advised Mr N that the insurance company had 
rejected the indemnity claim from them and unfortunately, they would need to debit his 
account. Mr N feels NatWest should reimburse him for their original mistake and refund him 
for the premiums they paid in error, plus interest on this sum. 
NatWest says while they have accepted their initial mistake, Mr N also needed to cancel the 
direct debit with the insurance company, and they were left with no option other than to 
accept the insurers rejection of their direct debit indemnity claim.
Mr N wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the information available but didnt uphold Mr Ns complaint. 
She felt while NatWest accepted that they should have cancelled the direct debit, Mr N did 
have regular statements sent to him showing the direct debit for his life insurance policy, and 
therefore he would have been aware of these payments. The investigator also felt NatWest 
had also acted correctly, under the rules of the direct debit indemnity scheme, when they 
debited Mr Ns bank account after the insurance company rejected the claim. 
Mr N wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said : 
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Mr N to find out the premiums for his life 
insurance, he had cancelled with his bank, had continued to be debited for around two 
years. I can also see how worrying it would have been for Mr N to be told by NatWest 
initially, it was their error and refunded him for that, only then to be re charged for these 
payments. When looking at this complaint I will consider if NatWest acted reasonably when 
reversing the initial refund, they had made to Mr N, when the insurer rejected the indemnity 
claim submitted. 
What happened here is Mr N arranged a meeting with NatWest to discuss his mortgage. 
During that meeting in November 2018, NatWests member of staff agreed to cancel Mr Ns 
direct debit for his existing life insurance policy, as it was understood a new policy was being 
taken out with a new insurance provider. Its worth saying this meeting was arranged by Mr 
N following an earlier discussion with his existing life insurer who had advised him his policy 
couldnt be amended to meet his new requirements. Its important to say that NatWest dont 
dispute they agreed to cancel the direct debit to Mr Ns existing insurers at that meeting, 
when his mortgage arrangements were discussed.  
From the information I have seen the direct debit for Mr Ns existing life insurance policy 
continued to be debited to his account until it was finally noticed by Mr N in October 2020 - 
these premiums totalled £2,129.76. I can see NatWest accepted their mistake, refunded the 
premiums charged to his bank account and offered Mr N £100 by way of an apology for this. 
NatWest then submitted a direct debit indemnity claim and this was rejected a few weeks 
later by the insurance company as they held a valid authority. NatWest says this was 
legitimately rejected by the insurer as Mr N hadnt cancelled the life insurance policy with the 
insurer. NatWest maintain they acted correctly, under the direct debit indemnity rules, to 
accept this rejection from the insurer and reversed the refund they had made to Mr Ns bank 
account. 
While I understand NatWest have correctly followed the direct debit indemnity procedures 
here, what I dont support is them debiting Mr Ns bank account, when the claim was 
rejected by the insurer, it was for them to absorb. I say this because the initial mistake, as 
accepted by NatWest, was the reason for the premiums being collected by the insurer here. 
Mr N was told by a NatWest employee they would cancel his direct debit for his existing 
policy, and they have accepted that. I am satisfied that in all probability in the meeting in 
November 2018, NatWest were aware of Mr Ns new life insurance arrangements and when 
they offered to cancel the direct debits for the premiums, it is reasonable to say Mr N would 
have believed no further direct debit payments would be collected from that point. NatWest 
says Mr N should have contacted his insurers to cancel the policy, that said I cant see any 
evidence to show this was explained to Mr N during the meeting in November 2018. On 
balance, I am satisfied Mr N believed, following that meeting, he had done what was 
necessary to cancel any further payments to the insurer. 
While like the investigator, I agree Mr N should have looked at his statements in more detail 
over the period in question, I dont feel this should detract from the central  issue, that 
NatWest failed to carry out their agreement to cancel future payments to the insurer. Its fair 
to say by not doing this, NatWest prevented any likelihood of the insurer contacting Mr N to 
discuss his policy, as they would have, if the direct debit  for the premiums had been 
cancelled. I am satisfied given all of this , Mr N should not suffer any financial loss as a 
result. 
Although NatWest will be disappointed with my decision, they should refund Mr N with 
£2,129.76 plus statutory interest of 8%. Given £100 has already been paid to compensate 
Mr N for the initial mistake, I am satisfied no further compensation payment is warranted 
here. 
Both Mr N and NatWest have responded to my provisional decision, so the case has been 
passed back to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I gave both Mr N and NatWest until 9 June 2021 to accept or reject my provisional decision. 
Mr N has accepted my provisional decision, but NatWest have raised queries concerning 
this.
NatWest says while accepting they did agree to cancel the direct debit, Mr N should have 
checked his bank statements sooner, which would have identified the premiums were still 
being paid. NatWest also feel Mr N benefited from the policy being in place during this time. 
I understand the points that NatWest have made here, but in my provisional decision I did 
accept Mr N should have checked his bank statements, albeit I didnt feel it detracted from 
the fact he had relied on NatWest to cancel the premiums of his old policy  - as they had 
agreed to do as part of his new mortgage arrangements. I am satisfied Mr N would assume 
this had been carried out for him and so, he may not have interrogated his bank statements 
to check NatWest had cancelled the direct debit as it promised.  
As far as NatWests view that Mr N had received benefit from having the policy in place, its 
worth saying that this is not a policy Mr N wanted to have in place or needed to meet his 
financial requirements at that time  so it follows, I dont support NatWests view Mr N 
derived any benefit from having the policy in place. 
With this in mind, I see no need to change or add to my provisional decision and so my final 
decision remains the same.
Putting things right
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr N £2,129.76 plus statutory interest of 8%. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr N £2,129.76 plus statutory interest of 8%.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2021.
