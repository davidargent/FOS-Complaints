The complaint
Mr B complains that Nationwide Building Society wont refund to him the money that he paid 
for a lifestyle concierge product and to relinquish a holiday ownership product. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr B and his wife had bought a holiday ownership product in May 1995. They entered into a 
membership application agreement with a supplier in June 2016 for a lifestyle concierge 
product. The joining fee was €6,300 and they agreed to pay annual renewal fees. Mr B paid 
€1,226 of the joining fee using his Nationwide credit card and £974.13 was charged to his 
account in June 2016. Mr B and his wife paid the balance of the joining fee by other means.
Mr B and his wife also entered into a separate agreement with a holiday company to 
relinquish their ownership of the holiday ownership product that theyd bought in May 1995. 
Mr B paid €699 to the holiday company using his Nationwide credit card and £555.40 was 
charged to his account in June 2016.
Mr Bs representative made a claim to Nationwide, on his behalf, in September 2020 under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for a refund of £6,870 (plus interest, legal costs 
and maintenance charges). It said that the supplier was in liquidation so was unable to 
perform its contractual obligations and was in breach of contract. It also said that the product 
was mis-sold to Mr B and his wife and the supplier misrepresented the product, its benefits 
and pressured them into purchasing a product which was unsuitable and failed to provide 
the advantages promised. It said that, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they 
wouldnt have purchased the product. Mr B provided a client statement in support of his 
claim. 
Mr B phoned Nationwide in December 2020 about his claim but it said that it had been 
unable to evidence that it received any communication from Mr Bs representative to request 
for a dispute to be raised. It asked him to provide evidence in support of his claim. Mr B then 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
supplier had breached the contract that it had agreed with Mr B and his wife. 
Mr Bs representative provided evidence showing that the supplier had gone into liquidation 
in September 2019 and it said that the breach of contract arising from that liquidation hadnt 
been considered. Our investigator said that the contract with the supplier was renewed in 
September each year but shed not seen evidence to show that Mr B had renewed the 
contract in September 2019. Mr Bs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Bs claim was made to Nationwide under section 75, which gives a consumer an 
equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit 
if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided 
that certain criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Bs claim under section 75 is that the supplier was in liquidation so was unable to 
perform its contractual obligations and was in breach of contract, the product was 
mis-sold to Mr B and his wife and the supplier misrepresented the product, its 
benefits and pressured them into purchasing a product which was unsuitable and 
failed to provide the advantages promised;
Mr Bs client statement says that he and his wife were very disappointed with the 
standard that they received from the supplier as they were never able to access what 
they wanted and he wished that hed never made the purchases but the sales 
presentation was very convincing;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs section 75 claim in this decision as only a 
court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Nationwides 
response to Mr Bs claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Bs representatives claim letter says that it was represented to Mr B and his wife 
that they would have access to additional features such as cheaper accommodation 
and luxury items such as concert tickets and restaurant meals (all at a discounted 
price) and that their existing holiday ownership product would be relinquished;
the membership application agreement says that Mr B and his wife were acquiring: a 
concierge service providing its members with various services through [the supplier] 
and/or its listed associates; and: All current services and benefits are shown in 
Appendix A  but Ive not been provided with a copy of Appendix A;
Mr B says: Several times we asked [the supplier] for concert tickets but we were told 
that we were unable to get these, so had to purchase them separately. The same 
thing happened to us when we tried to purchase Pantomime tickets, as we were told 
that these did not qualify;
I can understand Mr Bs disappointment with the services that he and his wife 
received from the supplier but Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence 
to show that the lifestyle concierge product was misrepresented or mis-sold to them;
Mr Bs representative says that the supplier represented that Mr B and his wifes 
existing holiday ownership product would be relinquished  but Mr B and his wife 
entered into a separate agreement with a holiday company in June 2016 and paid 
£555.40 for that product to be relinquished;
Ive seen no evidence to show that their holiday ownership product hasnt been 
relinquished, that the holiday company misrepresented the terms of the 
relinquishment to them or that it has breached its contract with them  and Im not 
persuaded that the supplier misrepresented to them that their holiday ownership 
product would be relinquished; 
Mr Bs representative says that the supplier went into liquidation in September 2019 
so was unable to perform its contractual obligations and was in breach of contract;
Mr B and his wife had to make a renewal payment each year for the services to 
continue  Ive been provided with evidence to show that they made a renewal payment of €194.17 in September 2017 and Ive seen the renewal reminder letter 
that was sent to them in August 2018 but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
made a renewal payment in September 2018 or September 2019;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr B and his wife were 
entitled to receive services from the supplier in September 2019 when it went into 
liquidation so Im not persuaded that the liquidation of the supplier is a breach of 
contract for which Nationwide would be liable in these circumstances under section 
75  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been 
any other breach of contract by the supplier for which Nationwide would be liable 
under section 75;
the membership application agreement says that the joining fee for the lifestyle 
concierge service: will not be refundable except in cases which are within the legal 
withdrawal period;
Mr B phoned Nationwide about his claim in December 2020 but it said that it had 
been unable to evidence that it received any communication from Mr Bs 
representative to request for a dispute to be raised and it asked him to provide 
evidence in support of his claim  but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr B or his 
representative provided the required evidence to Nationwide for it to consider his 
claim;
I consider that the final response that Nationwide sent to Mr B in December 2020 
was a fair and reasonable response in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that he and his wife have had with their lifestyle 
concierge product but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Nationwide to refund to him any of the money that hes claimed, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 October 2023.
