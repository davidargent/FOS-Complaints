The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has caused them 
distress and inconvenience by withdrawing an offer of compensation for a mis-sold Payment 
Protection Insurance (PPI) policy on a loan. Mr and Mrs S say they spent money on friends 
and family in anticipation of the payment, which they wouldnt have otherwise done  so they 
want compensation. 
What happened
The events leading up to this complaint were set out by the adjudicator so Im not going to 
repeat everything here. Briefly:
In September 2020 NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs S offering them a refund for mis-sold PPI 
on a loan. The letter said the offer was being made following a review of previously 
investigated PPI complaints, which involved a chain of loans.
Mr and Mrs S say they contacted NatWest on several occasions  firstly to clarify that the 
offer was genuine and then to chase up payment.
In November 2020 NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs S again telling them that no further 
payment was in fact due to them because they had already received refunds in 2011 and 
2012, which was in line with the Financial Ombudsman Service guidance.
Mr and Mrs S complain that while they didnt go out and spend all the money they thought 
was due to them, theyve spent some money helping out friends and family affected by the 
Covid-19 pandemic, which they wouldnt otherwise have done. Mr and Mrs S want 
compensation for this and for the distress and inconvenience the matter has caused them. 
In summary the adjudicator upheld Mr and Mrs S complaint and said that NatWests offer of 
£100 for the distress and inconvenience caused was fair in the circumstances. They 
explained that NatWest had made a mistake in offering Mr and Mrs S compensation in 
September 2020  it had already compensated them for the PPI policies they held when 
they received payments in 2011, 2012 and 2019. The adjudicator said that NatWests 
calculations it had provided showed that Mr and Mrs S had in fact received more than they 
should have  an overpayment of £346.75. But the adjudicator acknowledged that Mr and 
Mrs S had suffered distress and inconvenience as a result of NatWests error and NatWest 
subsequently offered Mr and Mrs S £100.
Mr and Mrs S disagree with the adjudicators conclusions. In summary they say the £100 
offered doesnt adequately compensate them  they want £100 for distress and 
inconvenience and at least £500 to replenish what they spent in anticipation of receiving the 
compensation NatWest said was due to them. Mr and Mrs S have also indicated that they 
dont believe what NatWest says about the amounts they have received because of the 
errors made across several pieces of correspondence.
Because the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it comes to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint and I direct NatWest to pay Mr and 
Mrs S £100 to reflect the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused them. My 
reasoning is set out below.
I can understand Mr and Mrs S frustration and disappointment at the way NatWest has dealt 
with things  they thought they were due more compensation for mis-sold PPI and spent 
time on the phone chasing up payment. NatWest has also got some things wrong in the 
letters it sent to Mr and Mrs S in 2020. So I accept theyve been inconvenienced by 
NatWests actions and I can also see why they might not believe theyve received the correct 
compensation for their mis-sold loan PPI. But I disagree with the extent to which Mr and Mrs 
S feel NatWest should fairly compensate them for the impact caused and Ill explain why.
Firstly I think it is important to clarify with Mr and Mrs S that Im satisfied they are not due 
further PPI compensation in relation to the three loans they took out. NatWest made a 
mistake when it told Mr and Mrs S in September 2020 that they were due further 
compensation  it believed it hadnt fully compensated them because it had missed out one 
of the loans in its calculations. I think the error came about because NatWests methodology 
for calculating compensation in a chain of loans has been refined over time and is slightly 
different to the approach it took in 2011.
But I am satisfied that NatWest has fully compensated Mr and Mrs S and that NatWest has 
considered all three of their loans in line with our approach to redressing mis-sold PPI.
Mr and Mrs S received compensation payments in 2011 and 2012. NatWest then made a 
further payment in 2019. It appears it was at this point that it identified it hadnt included one 
of the loans. I dont think in 2011 and 2012 NatWest fully accounted for the impact single 
premium PPI has on a chain of loans1 where one of the loans didnt have PPI as was the 
case here. But the 2019 payment addressed this oversight. 
So Mr and Mrs S should be assured that no further PPI compensation is outstanding in 
relation to three loans in question. In fact I can see from the updated redress calculations 
NatWest has provided that Mr and Mrs S have actually received more compensation than 
was due to them  a likely result of the refined redress calculator I referred to above. This 
means that rather than being owed more compensation, Mr and Mrs S have been overpaid 
by an amount of just under £350. But I dont expect NatWest to seek recovery of this.
Turning to the impact NatWests actions in this matter has had on Mr and Mrs S  its clear 
that Mr and Mrs S spent time and energy chasing up payment of what they were told they 
were due to receive. I can also see that NatWest made a couple of errors in its letter of 
November 2020  it quoted the wrong amount of compensation paid to Mr and Mrs S in 
2012 and erroneously referred to a letter of September 2011 instead of September 2020. 
And I think these things did nothing to instil confidence in Mr and Mrs S that NatWest was in 
control of matters and had already fully and properly compensated them.
But Mr and Mrs S have said the impact of them receiving notification that they were due 
1 a residual PPI amount from the first loan is transferred into the subsequent loan when refinancing 
occursextra PPI compensation is greater. This is because they say they spent money helping out 
family and friends who were suffering financially as a result of Covid-19. They say they 
wouldnt have done this had they not had several assurances from NatWest that payment of 
the extra compensation was due.
Ive thought about this carefully. And having done so, Im not persuaded NatWest is fairly 
responsible for this. I say this because I think its just as likely that Mr and Mrs S would have 
helped out their family and friends in any event given the circumstances. I dont think, more 
likely than not their action was a direct result of NatWests mistake such that its fair for me to 
hold NatWest responsible. 
I also cant ignore the fact that Mr and Mrs S have received an overpayment of PPI 
compensation  an amount close to £350. So taking everything into account, while I accept 
that Mr and Mrs S have suffered distress and inconvenience in this matter, I think an amount 
of £100 in recognition of this is fair in all the circumstances. 
Putting things right
To put things right NatWest should pay Mr and Mrs S an amount of £100 in recognition of 
the distress and inconvenience caused.  
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold this complaint and I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr 
and Mrs S an amount of £100 to reflect the distress and inconvenience caused to them as a 
result of National Westminster Bank Plcs errors. I make no other award.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision before 4 January 2022.
