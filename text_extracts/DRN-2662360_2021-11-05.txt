Complaint
Mr W is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt do more to help him 
when he was the victim of a scam.   
Background
On 28 March 2020, Mr W authorised a payment of £500 from his PayPal account. He did 
this after he received an email from a friend explaining that he needed financial help. 
Unfortunately, that email hadnt been sent by Mr Ws friend. It had been sent by a fraudster 
who had successfully gained access to that friends email account.
He tried to call the friend before making the payment but couldnt get through. As he sensed 
that the situation was urgent, he made the payment anyway. Shortly afterwards, he spoke to 
that friend who confirmed that a number of people had received similar emails from his 
account and that it had been hacked.
Mr W told PayPal that hed fallen victim to a scam on 30 March and provided details. It 
initially misunderstood what hed told it and assumed hed bought goods which hadnt been 
delivered. When he clarified what had happened, PayPal told him that the payment was 
unclaimed and that he could cancel it. Mr W said that there was no option on his account to 
unilaterally cancel the payment. The communication with PayPal continued the following day 
but by then the payment had been collected by the scammer.
Hed seen that the transaction still appeared on his account with the label pending  but on 
1 April, the label changed to complete. Mr Ws payment had been claimed by the scammer.
Mr W complained that PayPal didnt do enough to recover his money and said that, if it had 
acted more swiftly, it couldve done so successfully. PayPal rejected his complaint. It said 
that Mr W was asked to specify what type of payment he was making at the outset. Where a 
customer is paying for goods and services, they have the benefit of buyer protection  but 
in this instance, Mr W was making a personal payment and so no such protection was 
available. 
Mr W was unhappy with PayPals position and so he referred his complaint to this service. It 
was looked at by an Investigator who upheld it. The Investigator observed that there was a 
meaningful delay between Mr W telling PayPal that a scam had taken place and the funds 
being collected from the scammers account. If PayPal had attempted to recover Mr Ws 
payment as soon as he told it what had happened, he thought it was likely that theyd have 
succeeded. The Investigator recommended that the £500 payment be refunded to Mr W.
PayPal disagreed with the Investigators opinion. It said that Mr W had chosen to make a 
personal payment and so didnt have the benefit of buyer protection. It also argued that it 
had no way of knowing that this was a scam because all of the communications took place 
outside of PayPal and that Mr W shouldve contacted them before making the payment.
Because PayPal disagreed with the investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to 
me to consider and come to a final decision. 
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so, I agree with the Investigators conclusion that PayPal shouldve done 
more to attempt to recover the scam payment.
I agree that PayPal couldnt have prevented Mr W from falling victim to this scam. The 
payment wasnt unusual or out of character and so it wouldnt have had any basis for 
questioning the payment with Mr W before allowing it to be processed. And as its pointed 
out, all the communications relevant to the scam took place outside of PayPal.
However, the key issue here is whether PayPal did everything that it couldve been expected 
to do after the scam took place. The Investigator found that PayPal didnt attempt to recover 
Mr Ws funds quickly enough and I agree with that conclusion.
In my view, good industry practice required that PayPal attempt to recover Mr Ws payment 
immediately. Often in fraud cases the funds are removed by the scammer so quickly that 
such efforts wont be successful. But that wasnt the case here. The information that PayPal 
has shared with us suggests that the money wasnt removed from the scammers account 
immediately. If PayPal had acted within 24 hours of the time Mr W informed it of the scam , 
its highly likely that it wouldve been able to recover the money on Mr Ws behalf.
PayPal says it didnt have the option to cancel the payment from our side and that it cannot 
file a claim for a personal payment sent, but its not clear to me what the difficulty was. The 
payment here was sent between two PayPal accounts meaning there was considerably less 
complexity associated with recovery of funds since both accounts were administered by the 
same firm.
I dont think its relevant that Mr Ws selected payment type meant he wasnt covered by 
PayPals buyer protection policy. I dont think that supersedes the general obligation PayPal 
had to make a meaningful attempt at recovering Mr Ws losses  
Final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold this complaint. On the acceptance of this decision, 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA needs to pay £500 to Mr W without delay.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
