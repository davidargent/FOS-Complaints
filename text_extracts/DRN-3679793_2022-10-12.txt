The complaint
Ms R complains about mistakes made by National Westminster Bank Plc in relation to her 
loans. 
What happened
Ms R has two loans with NatWest. In early 2021 NatWest approved payment holidays under 
the Financial Conduct Authoritys Payment Deferral Guidance. The payment holidays ran for 
a total of six months and during this time no arrears information was recorded on Ms Rs 
credit file. Payments became due in July 2021. 
Ms R spoke with NatWest in July 2021 and discussed her circumstances at the time. Ms R 
explained she works freelance and her income remained impacted by the pandemic but 
hoped it would pick up shortly. An income and expenditure assessment was completed but 
showed a deficit. NatWests agent said the income deficit meant it wasnt able to agree a 
payment plan, but said they would put a collections hold in place for 30 days. 
NatWest later collected both contractual monthly payments by direct debit. The smaller loan 
payment (loan 1) was collected and applied to the balance. The larger direct debit payment 
intended for loan 2 was refunded due to a lack of funds in Ms Rs current account. 
Ms R later complained to NatWest and said its agent had failed to explain the normal direct 
debits would be claimed in July 2021 despite agreeing to place the accounts on hold. 
NatWest responded and apologised its agent hadnt made the process clear. 
In August 2021 Ms R called NatWest and said she wanted to make payments of £50 to each 
of the loans with a view to reinstating the contractual monthly payment in September 2021. 
NatWest asked Ms R to complete an income and expenditure assessment. Ms R went on to 
raise a complaint. 
NatWest issued a final response in September 2021 and agreed it had made some 
mistakes. NatWest advised that Loan 1 was still eligible to be refinanced as the July 2021 
payment was made and sent the relevant forms to Ms R. But NatWest said loan 2 was not 
eligible for refinance due to the returned direct debit in July 2021. NatWest accepted Ms R 
called with enough time to make her August 2021 payment but it wasnt collected and 
arranged to remove the missed payment from her credit file. NatWest paid Ms R £100 and 
refunded interest to her loans. 
Ms R went on to raise other complaints with NatWest in the months that followed. Ms R said 
NatWests income and expenditure assessment was unsuitable for the self employed 
working on a freelance basis. Ms R also complained about the contact she received 
regarding arrears. NatWest paid compensation to Ms R on various occasions due to issues 
with the service provided. 
From September 2021 onwards, Ms Rs loan payments have been made on time and in full. 
Loan 1 was refinanced with arrears that came about as a result of the payment holiday being 
added. But Loan 2 was not refinanced due to the missed payment in July 2021. 
An investigator at this service looked at Ms Rs complaint. They thought NatWest had dealt 
with Ms Rs complaint fairly and didnt ask it to take further action. Ms R asked to appeal and 
said she felt the use of income and expenditure assessments was unfair for self employed 
borrowers. Ms R also said NatWest had recently gone back on an agreement to refinance 
arrears on loan 2. As Ms R asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to make 
a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive set out the background to this complaint in less detail than the parties involved 
and Ive done so in my own words. I want to assure both parties that Ive read and 
considered all the information provided in reaching my decision. Im not going to respond to 
every point made by all the parties. No discourtesy is intended by my approach. Ive focused 
on what I think are the key issues in this complaint. 
My approach is in line with the informal nature of this service as a free alternative to the 
courts and the rules we operate under. If I havent mentioned something it isnt because Ive 
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every argument made to be 
able to reach what I think is the fairest outcome. 
Ive listened to the available calls and I can see NatWest accepts its agent shouldve been 
clearer when discussing the collections hold with Ms R in July 2021. I agree the call handler 
shouldve explained there were implications for not making July 2021s payments and that 
the ability to refinance may be impacted. But I think NatWest makes a reasonable point 
when it says Ms R gave it details about her finances at the time which showed she wasnt 
able to make the normal monthly payments. 
During the call in July 2021 Ms R provided information about her housing costs and 
expenses along with the benefits income she was receiving at the time. Ms R explained she 
believed her freelance income was due to increase in the following months but was unable 
to afford full payments that month. I agree NatWests agents failed to go through the full 
implications missing a payment. But as Ms R didnt have sufficient funds to make those 
payments, her position remains broadly the same. 
Ultimately, NatWest still collected July 2021s payments which led to a follow up complaint 
being made by Ms R. The payment for loan 1 was left in place, but the larger payment for 
loan 2 was returned due to insufficient funds. In my view, this adds weight to Ms Rs 
comments about being unable to manage the full payments in July 2021. 
So whilst I agree there were mistakes, it appears Ms Rs broadly in the same position. Loan 
1s payment wasnt refunded which means the missed payment only affected loan 2. 
As the July 2021 was missed for loan 2, Im satisfied its reasonable for NatWest to deal with 
it and the payment holiday arrears together. NatWest has explained the missed payment 
from July 2021 meant Ms R wasnt then eligible to refinance and Im satisfied thats the case. 
Ms Rs told us that she feels the income and expenditure assessment is unfair on freelance 
and self employed consumers. I take Ms Rs point, but when she completed the assessment 
in July 2021 NatWest used the figures provided. And NatWest has said it also uses 
information from bank statements to verify a borrowers position where possible. So whilst I accept there are different challenges for self employed borrowers, I havent seen evidence 
thats led to Ms R being treated unfairly. 
NatWest has made various payments to Ms R in terms of the service provided. Ive looked at 
the settlements paid and Im satisfied they fairly reflect the problems Ms Rs raised. 
In response to the investigator, Ms R said NatWest has more recently gone back on a 
promise to refinance loan 2. As that point doesnt form part of this case, I cant comment on 
the issues raised in my decision. But if Ms R remains concerned about NatWests actions 
she has the option of raising a separate complaint and referring it to us if it remains 
unresolved.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Rs complaint because National Westminster Bank Plc 
has already paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2022.
