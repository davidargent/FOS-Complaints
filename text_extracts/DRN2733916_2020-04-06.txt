In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator upheld Mr Os complaint in part and thought 
the loans from 5 to 17 should not have been given. Sunny didnt agree in full  it has made  
an offer for loans  11 to 16 only. The complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr O could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN27339162the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
Mr O hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 4 and loans 18 to 22 so I 
wont be looking at these  any further  as there is no ongoing disagreement about them. But I 
will bear them in mind  when Im looking at Mr Os other lending.  
Lending is unaffordable  if its clear the customers disposable  income  wasnt enough to make
the payments  for the borrowing at the time it was taken out. And I can see from what  we
know about Mr Os finances  that he had little disposable income left when loan 5 was 
provided.
As Ive said above,  in order for Mr Os loan to be sustainably affordable for him, he
needed to be able to make  the repayments on time, while  meeting  other  reasonable
commitments and without having  to borrow  again.  I can see from the information  Sunny
obtained before lending  that Mr O had little income  left over after meeting his usual monthly 
living costs  and credit commitments.
Mr O declared  monthly expenses of between  £1,201  against  a monthly income  of £1,240  
when taking out loan 5. I thought Sunny had enough information to see that Mr O was likely 
to have little disposable income left to afford the repayments on loan 5. Or at the very least  
the results shouldve prompted Sunny to carry out further checks.
Ref: DRN27339163For example, from what I can see of loan 5 Mr O had £39 left after paying  his usual monthly 
commitments and then had to make  a payment of £16 to Sunny. That would leave him with 
just £23 for any unexpected expenses and leaves almost no margin for error in terms of his 
declared expenditure  which is after all only an estimate.
Sunny had to make  sure the loan was sustainably affordable. So I think  it ought to have 
realised that leaving  Mr O with little disposable income (after the loan repayment) was most
likely to cause him difficulties. So it was wrong to give loan 5.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check from loan 5 would also have shown  that 
Mr O was spending a lot of his monthly income  on repaying other short-term loans. Ive seen 
that Mr O already had a significant number of existing short-term credit  commitments when 
he applied  for loan 5. It was clear from this that Mr O wasnt  using these high-cost loans to 
deal with a short-term cashflow problem. So, in these  circumstances,  Sunny  ought to have 
realised it was unlikely  Mr O wouldve been able to sustainably repay  loan 5  and any 
subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
12. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr O was not managing  to repay  their 
loans sustainably. Mr Os overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr O had borrowed on seven occasions in 
nine months and whilst  the amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over 
this period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship with Sunny. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr O was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Os 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Os first loan was for £400 and loan 12 was also for £400.   At this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mr O was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in their income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Mr O wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  17 was 
taken out 32 months after Mr Os first. Mr O had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr O lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr O borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Os ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN27339164So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 17 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 5 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 to 11 from Mr Os credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loans  12 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 12 to 17 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
