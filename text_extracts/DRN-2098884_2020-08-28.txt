The complaint
Mr D complains that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) was irresponsible to 
lend him money he couldnt afford to pay back.
What happened
Lending Stream provided 22 loans to Mr D over a five year period between February 2011

Mr D told us that he was borrowing from different payday lenders  sometimes just to pay for 
loans hed taken out with other lenders. He said that as a result of Lending Stream 
continuing to approve loans that were unaffordable for him he got into further debt and 
suffered financial hardship as a result.
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Ds complaint. He felt that he hadnt seen enough to say it 
was unfair for Lending Stream to provide loans 1 to 5 to Mr D  but loans 6 to 22 shouldnt 
have been lent. Our adjudicator set out the steps he said Lending Stream should do to put 
things right for Mr D.  
Lending Stream hasnt responded to our adjudicators view nor to any of the letters we sent 
chasing up a response and the complaint remains unresolved. Mr D is keen for his complaint 
to be decided without any further delay.
So this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr D could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
Lending Stream told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr D. It asked Mr D to 
provide details of his income and to tell Lending Stream what he normally spent each month 
 including what he paid towards any other credit arrangements he had set up. Lending 
Stream carried out checks on Mr Ds credit file and made adjustments where it thought it 
was reasonable to do so to make sure the loans were affordable for Mr D. 
Ive seen a summary of the results of those checks and they dont show anything that I think 
should reasonably have made Lending Stream think loans 1 -4 werent affordable for Mr D.
Looking at the repayments that Mr D needed to make on loans 1-4, the amounts wouldve 
seemed relatively affordable compared with the disposable income hed declared. Given 
these repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Ds circumstances at the time, and 
his borrowing history with Lending Stream, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for 
Lending Stream to ask Mr D for the amount of information that would be needed to show the 
lending was unsustainable before agreeing the first four loans. 
I do think Lending Stream should have looked further into Mr Ds circumstances by the time 
he took out loan 5. Hed started borrowing from Lending Stream around 19 months earlier 
and except for short gaps between some of those loans (in total around 3 months or so) for 
most of that time hed been paying Lending Stream loans. 
But, I havent seen anything in the information available to me which shows Lending Stream 
would have decided not to agree loan 5 had it done so. 
So I agree with our adjudicator about this loan also. And as it seems Mr D hasnt objected to 
what our adjudicator has said, then I don't think I need say more about loans 1-5. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr D, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ds case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point 
was reached by loan 6. I say this because:
by now, Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr D was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr D had taken out loan 6 barely three weeks after paying loan 5  
and borrowed slightly more
hed now been borrowing from Lending Stream for around 23 months  with no 
significant gaps between loans. So, when Mr D asked for loan 6, I think Lending 
Stream ought to have known that he wasnt likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. Loan 6 was for significantly more 
than Mr Ds first Lending Stream loan. And although the loan amounts had varied 
(and continued to do so) this overall pattern of lending suggests that he was asking 
to borrow because Mr Ds financial circumstances hadnt improved and he was now 
reliant on this sort of borrowing 
Mr D wasnt making any inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. He had 
paid large amounts of interest to service debt to Lending Stream over an extended 
period.
Our adjudicator thought that it was clear by loan 6 that borrowing and repaying these loans 
was now a normal aspect of Mr Ds life. I agree. And I think this is borne out by looking at 
Mr Ds ongoing borrowing from loan 6 onwards. He continued to borrow heavily for the 
next 3 years. And although there were sometimes breaks in between loans, these gaps 
werent ever for long enough to make me think that Mr Ds financial situation mightve 
changed significantly. So I think its fair to consider all these loans as one continuous chain 
of borrowing.
I think that Mr D lost out when Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from (and 
including) loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time
the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to have negative implications 
on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 22.
Putting things right
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr D towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 6 - 22, not including anything it has already refunded. 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr D which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Pay Mr D the amounts calculated in "A" and "B".
D. the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So Lending Stream should remove all entries about loans 6 -
 22 from Mr Ds credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint about loans 6 - 22. 
Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) should put things right for Mr D as set out 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
