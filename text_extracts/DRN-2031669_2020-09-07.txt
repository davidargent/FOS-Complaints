DRN-2031669
The complaint
Mr B complains that despite being assured by Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) that 
a direct debit had been correctly set up, it wasnt paid. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
- All parties agree Mr B was incorrectly told his direct debit would be paid. Mr B has 
told us he didnt incur any additional expenses as a result of Halifaxs error or the 
direct debit payment being delayed. 
- As Halifaxs error didnt lead to a financial loss for Mr B, Ive thought about whether 
the £125 it offered is fair. I note Mr B has requested £228.50 and explained why he 
feels Halifaxs settlement should be increased.
- Ive considered everything that Mr B and Halifax have said and sent us. Having done 
so, I havent found grounds to increase the settlement in this case. Whilst there was 
an error, it was quickly resolved and Mr B has confirmed there was no long-term 
impact or costs to him. 
- Im satisfied that £125 fairly reflects the impact of Halifaxs errors on Mr B. As a 
result, Im not telling it increase the award or take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint because Bank of Scotland plc (trading as 
Halifax) has already made an offer that is fair and reasonable. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2020.
