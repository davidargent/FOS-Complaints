Miss W complains about irresponsible lending by DJS (UK) Limited trading  as PiggyBank. 
Miss W says that PiggyBanks loans trapped her in a debt spiral  and she has had to borrow  
more to cover the repayments. And PiggyBank  should not have given her unaffordable  
loans.

This table  was provided to us by PiggyBank. I have adapted it slightly.  It summarises the 
details of the approved loans. The highlighted ones (Loans 8 and 11) are where PiggyBank 
has offered to put things right. PiggyBanks offer was to refund interest and charges  plus 8% 
interest payment  on those  refunds and use that to offset against  the outstanding  Loan 11 
balance. It offered to amend Miss Ws credit  file as well. So I consider that Loans 8 and 11 
are not in dispute and I do not plan to review those. 
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and thought that PiggyBank should put 
things right in relation  to loans 5 to 11. Miss W has not made any particular comment  about 
our adjudicators view and so from that it seems she accepts the outcome. 
PiggyBank disagreed about  the uphold opinion for Loans 5 to 7 and Loans  9 and 10. I have  
listened to the telephone conversation between our adjudicator  and PiggyBanks  
representative and I summarise its observations as being:
the remaining  income left to Miss W after she had paid all of her outgoings (including 
credit commitments  and the PiggyBank  loan)  was enough for Miss W in her 
circumstances; and 
Ref: DRN30553692it is not fair to include the payments to repay borrowings from friends and family in 
financial calculations without additional detail; and
there were several gaps during the lending relationship and PiggyBank  considers 
that it did carry out proportionate checks taking these gaps into account as well. 
As the unresolved complaints are Loans 5 to 7 and Loans 9 and 10 then it is these I will be 
considering. But I will not be looking at them in isolation, but within  the context of the lending 
relationship as a whole.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
PiggyBank says it obtained income  and expenditure information from Miss W and factored 
into its calculations the credit commitments  it discovered having carried out credit searches 
for Miss W. It concluded  she had a high disposable income (between £900 and £1,000), with 
relatively low declared expenditure. Miss W had told PiggyBank she was living at home with 
her parents.  And based on what it saw from this it decided  to lend to Miss W.
In PiggyBanks final response letter to Miss W it made reference several time to the 
responsibility on Miss W to be accurate when applying for loans. PiggyBank writes about 
what it refers to as the concept of irresponsible borrowing  and goes on to say that this 
would be the case if Miss W was in a position  where you knew you would  be unable to pay 
this loan back.
The general import  surrounding the rules and regulations governing  regulated lenders such  
as PiggyBank is that it has to carry out a borrower focussed creditworthiness  assessment. 
And the onus is very much on it as the potential lender to ensure that the checks  carried out 
were proportionate to the loan applied for before making a lending  decision. 
Ref: DRN30553693gaps between lending
I address this point  first. One gap is between Loan  3 and 4. It was for less than four months. 
In this context I do not think  that this is long enough a gap to break  any chain of lending.  
Between Loans 4 and 5 the gap was less than two months and so I take the same  view.
Between Loans 8 and 9 it was four months and between Loans  9 and 10 over five. But by 
this time (July 2016 and February  2017) PiggyBank had been lending  to Miss W for 
18 months and two years respectively. 
I do not consider  that gaps of these  lengths  around  these  stages  in the lending relationship 
would have been enough to warrant it leading to a break in the lending chain.
So I do consider  that the period from Loan 1 to Loan 11 is a continuous period of lending. 
Loan 5
Miss W applied for this loan on 18 March  2016 for £100. This was the fifth loan in the chain 
and so I would have expected that PiggyBank carried out a full review of Miss Ws financial 
position, including verifying her income,  expenditure, regular financial commitments  and 
short-term loan (STL) liabilities she may have had at the time she applied.  
I have reviewed the detailed figures  our adjudicator identified from PiggyBanks own credit 
search results carried out at the time, Miss Ws bank statements for the month leading up to 
her application  (February 2016)  and Miss Ws personal credit  file provided to us by her. 
I have thought carefully about PiggyBanks points. In relation to the payment to a friend 
(£200) this month I have  discounted it as I can see that she received an unexpected 
additional income of about £200  in February  2015  and so in fairness to PiggyBank  I have set 
one off against the other. So no figure is included for that for Loan 5. This additional income 
does not appear  on Miss Ws bank  statements  again. 
But I have seen that Miss W had to pay about  £50 in bank charges and she had about £520  
of STL due to repay that month as well as £205  of regular  financial expenditure and almost  
£400 in living costs. These sums  amount to about £1,175. 
I note that PiggyBanks own credit search  results show that Miss W had credit  card and 
unsecured loan balances amounting to almost  £1,400. And it shows  a separate entry  of 
Bank Account as £8,730.  I have  seen on Miss Ws personal credit file that she took a bank 
loan for over £10,000 in March 2015 and so by the time the PiggyBank  search was being 
carried out its likely that the £8,730 figure was the outstanding  balance  in March  2016. So it 
was on notice she had at least one large  debt. 
Plus Miss Ws declared expenditure to PiggyBank was £70 whereas I think it likely that 
additional questions  about those regular expenditure figures ought to have  been  asked, 
especially as I consider the proportionate  checks at this stage ought to have been a full 
financial review of Miss Ws situation  as I have  outlined above. PiggyBank  had other  details 
from Miss Ws credit file relating  to credit cards  and unsecured loans. Clearly her financial 
life was more  complicated  than her declared £70 for transport and food. And PiggyBank  had 
the information available to recognise this. 
Ref: DRN30553694PiggyBank continued  to make its calculations on Miss Ws declared income (£1,500) 
whereas at this stage  of the lending  relationship  I would have expected  it to have  verified her 
actual income (£1,350). I have used her actual income figure.  So before repaying PiggyBank  
I think that Miss W had about £175 left over. 
Miss W may have had some  money  left over after payment of all the outgoings identified 
(including the £105 for the PiggyBank Loan 5) but I do not think that a relatively  slim margin  
of around £70 (£175 less £105) is a satisfactory sum. The reason I consider this to be too 
low is that this works out to be about  £2 a day and allows no margin  for any extra  
expenditure in relation to daily life which may arise and which  has not been  anticipated  in 
these fairly  general  calculations. 
I uphold Miss Ws complaint in relation to Loan 5.
Loan 6 and 7
Loan 6 was an instalment loan which extended Miss Ws indebtedness  for three  months. 
The repayments were  £124 a month which is higher than the repayment for Loan 5 (£105) 
which I have decided  was unaffordable.  PiggyBanks credit search for Loan 6 revealed much 
the same  information  as before. Miss Ws STL liability had increased and our calculations  
show that it is likely Miss W would  have had no income left over at all with which to repay 
PiggyBank its Loan 6.
I uphold Miss Ws complaint in relation to Loan 6.
Loan 7 was larger still and the repayments  were for a similar sum to the Loan  6 instalment 
repayments at £130  a month. Miss Ws indebtedness would have  been  extended for five 
months for Loan  7 and as I have already decided that the repayments of £124 a month for 
three months were  not likely affordable to her then I have come to the same conclusion  for 
Loan 7.
I uphold Miss Ws complaint in relation to Loan 7.
Loans going forward  
Miss Ws situation did not improve and I do consider that appropriate  and full financial 
checks would have  established this. Miss W took more STL and it was clear that she had 
become reliant  on them as a supplement to her income. 
The loan requests increased and the time periods in which to repay them  became longer  
up to five months  for example Loan 10. 
Piggybank has accepted  that it needs  to put things  right for Miss W for Loans 8 and 11. 
Loan 9 was a payday loan for £400 with a repayment figure of over £500  which  should have 
been repaid at the end of March 2017.  In this month  I have not included  the large  repayment  
to her friend (£320) and still the figures  I have seen (including her STL liability to other 
lenders) demonstrate to me that Miss W would not have had enough  to repay the PiggyBank  
Loan 9.
Ref: DRN30553695Loan 10 was much the same except that an additional regular loan had been taken out. The 
repayment for Loan 10 was to have been about  £150 a month for five months. Miss W had 
other STL commitments, and the figures I have seen  demonstrate  to me that she would not 
have been able to afford  Loan  10 instalments at all.
I think that the checks I would have expected  PiggyBank to have done, had they been  
carried out, would likely  have led it to make different lending decisions to the ones it did 
make. 
I uphold Miss Ws complaint in relation to Loans 9 and 10. 
putting things right 
To put things right for Miss W, PiggyBank should  honour the offer it has made in relation  to 
Loans 8 and 11 which I have included here for ease of reference. PiggyBank  must:
refund  all the interest and charges applied as a result of loans 5 to 11; and
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were,  to the date of settlement**;
remove any adverse payment information  recorded on Miss Ws credit file as a result 
of the interest  and charges on these  loans; and
PiggyBank is entitled to set off any monies arising  from the redress  against any monies  
Miss W may owe it, but to be clear this should  only be in respect of the principal sum 
borrowed. Any unpaid  charges and interest would need to be removed first and any 
payments made to the loan treated as if Miss W had paid down the principal.
If a third party owns any debt then in order to do the set off I have outlined  above, PiggyBank 
will need  to repurchase that debt. If it does not do that then it cannot do the set off and the 
full amount due will be repayable to Miss W directly. And in those circumstances the third 
party will need to be directed by PiggyBank to correct any adverse entries  on Miss Ws credit  
file, so far as it is able to do so. 
**HM Revenue  & Customs requires PiggyBank  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint in part and direct that DJS (UK) Limited 
trading as PiggyBank  put things right in the way I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 March 2019.
