The complaint
Mr E complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) irresponsibly gave him 2 credit card account 
facilities that he couldnt afford.
What happened
On 8 November 2017, Mr E applied for and was given a credit card account with NewDay 
with a credit limit of £900 under the trading name of Aqua. I will refer to this as Account A.  
On 23 May 2019, Mr E applied for and was given a credit card account with NewDay with 
a credit limit of £1200 under the trading name of Marbles. I will refer to this as Account B.  
In 2022, Mr E complained to NewDay to say that the accounts shouldnt have been 
opened for him because it wasnt affordable and that NewDay ought to have made a 
better effort to understand his financial circumstances before increasing his credit.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. Mr E didnt agree. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill confine my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to consider it 
but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome in the wider context. My remit is to take an overview and decide whats fair in 
the round.
NewDay will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. 
So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website.
Mr Es complaint is that NewDay made credit available that was unaffordable. NewDay has 
explained that it carried out a credit check using a credit agency to determine the amount of 
credit it was able to offer. Its possible that NewDay failed to make adequate checks before 
providing Mr E with credit. But even if thats true, I dont think better enquiries would have 
caused NewDay to think the credit was unaffordable. 
I say this because Mr E told NewDay that he earned a good salary. Mr Es bank 
statements show that Mr Es account enjoyed an income that was both regular and not 
modest. And the statements suggest that whatever other monthly commitments Mr E may 
have had for other credit, the total income each month was roughly the same as his 
monthly expenditure. And the credit reports I have seen show no CCJs or defaults in the 
years before the sale, except for the one that happened in 2015. Had NewDay been 
aware of this on the occasion it arranged credit, I think it unlikely that this would have put 
NewDay off providing reasonably modest credit on the credit cards.  
So, having considered all the submissions made in this case, and in the absence of any 
extra evidence from Mr E to the contrary, I have seen insufficient evidence to think that 
more thorough affordability checks would have led NewDay to think that the credit it 
provided Mr E was unreasonable. Further, Im not persuaded that what NewDay could see 
of his management of other credit ought to have prompted it to have acted differently than 
it did. 
I know that Mr E will be disappointed with my decision. But I want Mr E to know that I have 
noted all the submissions made in this case. Having done so, I have not found sufficient 
evidence to uphold this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2022.
