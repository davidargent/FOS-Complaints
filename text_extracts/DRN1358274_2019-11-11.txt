K820x#14complaint
Mr C and Miss R are unhappy that the payments and balance have gone up on their 
Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) mortgage.  They also say Halifax has been 
demanding payments before theyre due and sub-accounts that had been closed were 
reopened.
background
Mr C and Miss R took out the mortgage in 1995  and a further  advance  in 2003.
The earliest statement  we have available shows a year-end balance  on 31 January 2012 as 
£28,905 (for ease  of reading  Ill just use whole pounds in this decision, unless I need  to be 
more specific) with £26,150 of that being held on an interest-only basis. The remaining  term 
was shown to be 8 years.
The next statement  in that format shows a year-end balance on 31 January 2013  as 
£28,932, with £26,150 of that being  held on an interest-only basis.  The remaining term was 
shown to be 7 years.
In March 2013 Halifax changed  its computer  system  and issued a letter  setting out the 
account status at that time.  That letter showed  four sub-accounts, with sub-account one 
having a balance of £1,795, sub-account two £1,644, sub-account  three £8 and sub-account 
four £26,119. The letter  said sub-accounts one, two and three  were  held on a repayment  
basis and sub-account four was interest-only. It also explained  that the monthly payments 
didnt include an amount towards the buildings insurance premium as Mr C and Miss R had 
indicated they wanted that paid over the mortgage  term rather  than in twelve  monthly  
instalments.
Statements were then issued each  February in a format that broke  the account down into the 
four sub-accounts.  The overview of these  showed the total year-end  balances to be:
31 January 2014 £29,085
31 January 2015 £29,425
31 January 2016 £29,885
31 January 2017 £30,066
31 January 2018 £30,436
31 January 2019 £30,244
The buildings insurance premiums were noted on the statements to be:
1 March 2011 £369
1 March 2012 £580
1 March 2013 £692
3 March 2014 £827
2 March 2015 £895
2 March 2016 £571
2 March 2017 £698
2 March 2018 £809
Ref: DRN13582742Over the years Mr C and Miss R have at times overpaid and at other times underpaid, but 
these have only been taken into account when there  was some  other trigger  for the 
contractual mortgage payment to be reviewed,  such  as an interest rate change. This has led 
to the requested payment  going up when the interest rate has gone down, and vice versa.
Our adjudicator didnt  think the complaint should  be upheld. Mr C and Miss R didnt  agree  
and so it comes to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I trust Mr C and Miss R wont take it as a 
discourtesy that Ive condensed their complaint  in the way that I have. Although  Ive read 
and considered the whole file Ill keep my comments to what  I think  is relevant. If I dont 
comment on any specific point its not because Ive not considered it but because I dont 
think I need to comment  on it in order to reach the right outcome. 
This service is impartial between, and independent  from,  consumers and businesses. What  
this means is that we dont represent  either party, and I dont act under eithers  instructions  
or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at or what  questions  should be asked or 
answered.
Looking at the various mortgage statements, its apparent that the mortgage balance hasnt 
been reducing at the level it needed to if the repayment element is to be fully repaid in 2020. 
The statements  show  the balance  actually  went up in four consecutive  years (2014-18) and 
even though it went down by £192  in the year ending 31 January 2019, that still left a 
repayment balance  of £3,097 to repaid (plus interest) in just the one year remaining (as well 
as the interest-only balance that was shown to be £27,147 at that time).
Over the years Mr C and Miss R have overpaid  on occasions and underpaid on others, but 
their monthly payment wasnt recalculated each month to take all those into account.  Those  
variables would only be taken into account  if something triggered a payment recalculation  
typically a rate change. I understand Mr C and Miss R dont think  theyve underpaid so Ive 
looked at some snapshots of the account:
Snapshot one shows  for sub-account one between April and June 2016  the monthly 
payment due was £25, but only £22 was received  each month.
Snapshot two shows  for sub-account one between April and June 2017 the monthly 
payment due was £90, but only £57 was received  each month.
Snapshot three shows for sub-account one between April and June 2018 the monthly 
payment due was £138. But only £93 was received  in April,  and £64 each  in May and 
June (and Junes payment was made late, in July).
Its clear from this that Mr C and Miss Rs account wouldnt be on track to repay  the 
repayment element  of the mortgage  within the agreed term, and therefore Halifax had to put 
up the monthly repayment due even if the interest  rate went  down. Partly  this increase was 
due to Mr C and Miss R not paying  enough,  but also it was due to the fact the buildings 
insurance premiums were added to the mortgage  each  year (and therefore became interest 
bearing) but Mr C and Miss R didnt pay them. 
Ref: DRN13582743I understand between  1995 and 1997 Mr C and Miss R made lump sum payments to the 
mortgage each  year to pay the buildings insurance premiums in full, so they didnt become 
part of the mortgage balance, but since then the premiums  have  just been added to the 
mortgage account so increased the debt each year. This was explained in the 2013 letter:
Your total monthly payment  does not include a twelfth of your mortgage linked 
insurance, as you have previously indicated to us that you would like this to be paid over 
the mortgage term rather than in 12 monthly  instalments.
Any insurance premiums added to your mortgage that remain unpaid are included in 
the amount you owe and you will be charged  interest  on these.
Ive looked at the transactions and theres nothing  there that appears unusual or incorrect. 
Of course,  its open to Mr C and Miss R to instruct an independent qualified professional to 
audit their account, but that would have  to be at their expense. Wed only consider Halifax 
responsible for the cost of the audit if it ultimately  revealed errors to Mr C and Miss Rs 
detriment. As things stand, Im not persuaded that Halifax has mis-managed  the account.
Mr C and Miss R have  said Halifax  has reopened sub-accounts that have been closed but 
thats not the case. Ive looked at the letters Mr C and Miss R have  provided  and compared 
these to the mortgage statements.  Having  done  so its clear sub-account three  was fully 
repaid (and closed) on 8 August 2018  and sub-account two was fully repaid (and closed) on 
3 September 2018. Neither sub-account has been reopened.
Finally, Mr C and Miss R said Halifax has pursued  them for repayments in advance of the 
dates they were due. Despite our adjudicator asking for more information about  this from 
Mr C and Miss R its not been  forthcoming,  and having considered  everything  we have on 
file I cant find any instance where Halifax has asked for money before it was due.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means well not be engaging  in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask 
Mr C and Miss R to accept or reject  my decision before 11 December  2019.
