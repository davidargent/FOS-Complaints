The complaint
Mr F complains about three logbook loans provided to him by CarCashPoint limited, 
(CarCashPoint) which he says were unaffordable.
What happened
CarCashPoint provided Mr F with log book loans. These loans were granted on the basis 
that Mr F provided CarCashPoint with a bill of sale for his car. This meant that if Mr F didnt 
make his loan repayments, CarCashPoint could potentially recoup its losses through the 
sale of the vehicle. 
I looked into whether these 3 loans were given to Mr F fairly. The details are as follows:
Number Amount Date taken instalments Monthly 
amountTotal to repay
1 £2560 16.01.2018 78 Weeks £321.44 £5786.04
2 £810 25.08.2018 78 Weeks £117.91 £2122.33
3 £3060 18.02.2019 18 Months £321.42 £6915.60
Mr F says the loans were unaffordable and shouldnt have been given to him.
CarCashPoint had agreed to put things right regarding loans 2 and 3. So I looked into loan 1.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in January 2022. Both parties have received 
a copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the 
decision below. I said;
As set out above, CarCashPoint gathered some information from Mr F about his income 
and expenses before it agreed the loans.
Did CarCashPoint carry out proportionate checks?
Ive read how CarCashPoint says it asked about Mr Fs financial circumstances for the loan it 
granted on 16 January 2018, but Im not currently satisfied that the checks it says it carried 
out, went far enough. It submitted several documents about the checks it carried out for all 3 
loans but most of these documents relate to loans 2 and 3. So although it says it asked Mr F 
about his income and expenditure and verified his income and rent paid through checking 
bank statements, I havent been able to look through the statements that it says it had in 
front of it. I also havent seen how it would have checked whether Mr F had any credit 
impairment at the time. It has told our service that Mr F declared his income to be £1800 and 
his expenditure as £762 and this would have left him with disposable income that would 
have meant he wouldve comfortably afforded the loan repayments. But I havent seen what 
CarCashPoint would have seen on this occasion about what it says it gathered to make its 
lending decision for loan 1.  
When I consider what I have just concluded and also see the amount Mr F was looking to 
borrow, the length of time and also the overall amount he was going to repay, I currently 
think CarCashPoint should have done more in its checks than I have seen it do, to assure 
itself that Mr F could sustainably repay the loan over the 78 weeks. 
For the above reasons, I dont currently think CarCashPoint has been able to demonstrate 
that the checks it carried out for loan 1 were proportionate.
What would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown?
I need to think about what CarCashPoint would have seen if it had carried out proportionate 
checks. Our adjudicator asked Mr F to provide his bank statements from around the time he 
applied for loan 1. Im not suggesting here that this is the check that CarCashPoint should 
have done. But I think looking at the bank statements he has now provided would give me 
the best picture of what the lender should have seen if it had asked for more.
Ive carefully considered the information provided within the statements. Having done so, its 
clear Mr F was gambling significant amounts of money at the time he asked for this loan. In 
these circumstances, it is apparent to me that further checks would have shown 
CarCashPoint that Mr F was unlikely to have been able to repay this loan without borrowing 
further or experiencing financial difficulty.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would have 
shown CarCashPoint that Mr F would not have been able to sustainably repay loan 1. So, 
Im satisfied that UK Credits failure to carry out proportionate checks resulted in it unfairly 
providing this loan to Mr F. In addition, CarCashPoint also agrees that it didnt make a fair 
lending decision for loans 2 and 3. So it now needs to put things right for loans 1-3.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. Mr F responded and said he agrees and has no further points to 
make. CarCashPoint did not respond to the findings of my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F has not made any new points for me to respond to and CarCashPoint has not 
responded. So, as neither party has anything further to add that I feel I need to comment 
on or that will change the outcome of this complaint, I dont see any reason to depart from 
my findings within my provisional decision. With that being the case, I uphold Mr Fs 
complaint.  
Putting things right
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr F to repay the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because he has had the benefit of that lending. But he has been indebted with interest and 
charges on lending that shouldnt have been provided to him.
CarCashPoint should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges on loans 1-3 and treat all the payments Mr F 
has made as payments towards the capital.If reworking Mr Fs loan account results in him having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then CarCashPoint should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*.
Treat Mr F fairly, If there is a balance remaining for him to repay. It should work with 
Mr F to find an affordable payment plan.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Fs credit file in relation to loans 1-
3. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint should give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks 
for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint and direct CarCashPoint Limited to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2022.
