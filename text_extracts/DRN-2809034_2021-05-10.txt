The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd refused to transfer his credit card balance to his loan 
account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
I can appreciate Mr Hs frustration at the delay in NewDay responding to his request for his 
credit card balance to be transferred to his loan account. NewDay has accepted that it was 
slow to respond and it has paid £40 compensation and refunded fees of £36. I appreciate Mr 
H was stressed by the delay as he was struggling financially. However, in terms of 
NewDays failure to respond in a timely manner I consider its offer of redress to be fair.
The central issue is NewDays refusal to agree to Mr Hs request. This was not an option 
which NewDay offered to its customers. It does not transfer balances from credit card 
accounts to loan accounts. Nor can I require it to do so. This is a commercial decision which 
it is entitled to take. As our investigator has pointed out this not common industry practice. 
It can consider a loan application which Mr H could use to pay off the credit card balance, 
but Mr H would have to make an application and there is no guarantee that this would be 
successful. However, in order for a resolution to be found both parties need to talk. I have 
noted that initially Mr H made numerous efforts to contact NewDay requesting a transfer. I 
am also aware that NewDay tried calling Mr H on a number of occasions, but without 
success.
As our investigator has pointed out NewDay wrote to Mr H seven times in December 2019 
and January 2020. I have also noted that since our involvement our investigator has 
endeavoured to arrange a number of calls between the two parties, but without success. He 
has made significant efforts to get a dialogue going and I am satisfied that NewDay did try 
and call Mr H, but to no avail.
Mr H stopped making payments and so this has been reported to the credit reference 
agencies. NewDay has said it was obliged to do so and I cannot require it to do otherwise. It 
is simply reporting the factual position. 
I am aware Mr H has made further complaints about the level of support offered by NewDay 
after the onset of the Covid pandemic, but these are separate issues and the business is 
entitled to address these before this service can become involved.
I recognise Mr H has found this matter stressful and it needs to be resolved, but I cannot say 
that, other than the initial delays for which NewDay has paid compensation, it has done 
anything wrong. It isnt obliged to make the transfer Mr H requested via email. I have noted 
Mr Hs comments about NewDay and its handling of vulnerable customers, but I do not 
believe this allows me to uphold his complaint.
I have every sympathy with Mr H and I trust he and NewDay can enter into a constructive 
conversation. I would also remind NewDay of its obligation to deal with Mr H positively and 
sympathetically in helping him resolve his financial difficulties.
My final decision
NewDay Ltd has already made an offer to pay £40 and forgo £36 fees to settle the complaint 
and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances. So my decision is that NewDay Ltd 
should pay £40 and forgo £36 fees if it has not already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2021.
