The complaint
Mrs R complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid for some timeshare relinquishment services. Shes being represented 
by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs R had a timeshare and she entered into a contract of services with a timeshare 
relinquishment company in February 2015 for it to arrange the disposal of her timeshare 
interests and to pursue a compensation claim for the mis-selling of the timeshare. She 
agreed to pay £4,980 for those services. 
Her representative made a claim to Barclaycard under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 in June 2019 for the £3,332.20 that it said that shed paid in January 2016 towards 
the timeshare disposal and compensation claim using her Barclaycard credit card. 
Barclaycard said that payment for the contract of services was due in March 2015 and the 
payment of £3,332.20 was made in January 2016 and was for the timeshare companys 
management fees. It also said that it had checked Mrs Rs statements since February 2015 
and had found no evidence that the £4,980 payment for the contract of services was made 
using her Barclaycard credit card.
Mrs R wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that he couldnt reasonably 
conclude that the £3,332.20 payment made to timeshare relinquishment company in January 
2016 was in relation to the February 2015 contract which required a £4,980 payment by 
March 2015. He said that he couldnt agree that Mrs R was due a refund under section 75 
which Barclaycard would be liable for.
Mrs R representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided an e-mail exchange between Mrs R and the timeshare 
relinquishment company from January 2016 about the payment that she was required to 
make.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Rs complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
she used her Barclaycard credit card to pay at least part of the £4,980 price for the 
contract of services, that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the timeshare relinquishment company and that Barclaycards response to her claim 
under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of 
Mrs Rs claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Barclaycard has provided evidence to show that Mrs R used her Barclaycard credit 
card to make a payment of £3,332.20 to the timeshare relinquishment company in 
January 2016 and that that payment was for the timeshare companys management 
fees;
it also said that it had checked Mrs Rs statements since February 2015 and had 
found no evidence that the £4,980 payment for the contract of services was made 
using her Barclaycard credit card;
Mrs R entered into a contact of services with the timeshare relinquishment company 
in February 2015 and the payment schedule shows that she was to make a payment 
of £4,980 by a specified date in the following month and the payment details were set 
out, including the name of the account and the sort code and account number  
which would indicate that a payment was to be made by bank transfer rather than by 
credit card;
Mrs R has provided an e-mail from the timeshare relinquishment company from 
January 2016 in which she was sent a link to make a payment of £4,980  but she 
replied to note that the amount payable was £3,332.20 and the rest of that e-mail 
exchange relates to a payment of £3,332.20, a large proportion of which related to 
management fees  and that was nearly a year after the contract of services had 
been entered into and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
this payment was part of the contract price that was due by March 2015;
Barclaycard would only be liable under section 75 for any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the timeshare relinquishment company if Mrs R had paid at 
least part of the price for the services that it was providing using her Barclaycard 
credit card;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs R paid any part of 
the £4,980 for the contract of services using her Barclaycard credit card so I dont 
consider that Barclaycard would be liable under section 75 for a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the timeshare relinquishment company;
nor am I persuaded that the £3,332.20 that Mrs R paid to the timeshare 
relinquishment company using her Barclaycard credit card in January 2016 was a 
payment for the contact of services  I consider that its clear that a large proportion 
of that payment that was due to the timeshare company for its management fees;
I consider that Barclaycards response to Mrs Rs claim under section 75 was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that its acted incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclaycard to refund to 
Mrs R any of the money that shes paid to the timeshare relinquishment company, to 
pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
