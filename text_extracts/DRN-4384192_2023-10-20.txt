The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly withheld his funds after they 
closed his accounts. 
What happened
Ms A held an account with NatWest. In July 2022 they conducted a review of his accounts 
and asked him for some further information about some payments hed received. Mr A 
explained why hed received the money but wasnt able to provide any proof of entitlement to 
the funds.
NatWest decided to close Mr As accounts, giving him two weeks notice, but they continued 
to retain the funds in the account  which was about £36,000.
Mr A complained to NatWest about the closure and the funds not being released to him. 
NatWest responded to say that theyd closed the account in line with their terms but would 
not discuss the exact reasons. They said their review of his account was ongoing and they 
would release the funds when this was complete.
Unhappy that his funds hadnt been returned Mr A referred his complaint to our service. 
Before it was looked at by an investigator NatWest agreed to refund £14,615.10 to him. They 
arranged a transfer to Mr As bank, but he said he hadnt received it.
One of our investigators thought the complaint should be upheld. They felt Mr A hadnt 
received the funds  and on reviewing the figures provided felt NatWest should return 
around £16,000 to him. They also felt NatWest should pay 8% simple interest per annum on 
top in recognition of the delays in returning these funds.
Mr A accepted this to resolve the complaint. But NatWest provided further information on the 
amount they were returning. NatWest also found the money from Mr As transfer, which had 
been made using the wrong name causing Mr As bank to reject it. A second investigator 
reviewed the complaint and was satisfied that the £14,615.10 figure NatWest had calculated 
was correct. But they agreed NatWest had cause delays in returning the funds to Mr A and 
suggested £100 compensation.
NatWest arranged to transfer the funds to Mr A. But Mr A disagreed with this as an outcome, 
saying the delay in sending the funds had caused him to miss paying rent, and incur other 
expenses. He asked why he had originally been awarded a higher figure.  But the 
investigator remained content that the right figure was returned to him, and didnt feel more 
compensation was warranted.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its right to say that NatWest, like all regulated financial businesses in the UK, have strict 
legal and regulatory obligations to meet when providing accounts to their customers. These 
obligations mean theyre required to monitor account activity, and on occasion ask for further 
information about payments into accounts. If there are concerns, then they may also need to 
block accounts and withhold funds while they carry out an investigation. There is provision 
for this in the terms of Mr As account.
In this case I can see NatWest asked Mr A about several payments into his account and 
restricted his account while they investigated. NatWest arent under any specific obligation to 
explain why theyre carrying out a review and have already declined to do so. It wouldnt be 
appropriate for me to detail these in full here  our services rules say that certain evidence 
can be provided to us in confidence, and Im satisfied this applies here. But from what Ive 
seen Im satisfied that NatWests concerns were legitimate, and it was reasonable for them 
to restrict the account. 
Theres no specific timeframe Id expect reviews to be completed in, but they generally 
should be done as quickly and efficiently as possible. In this case Ive seen nothing to 
suggest there were any unnecessary delays caused by NatWest.
NatWests terms also outline when they can end a relationship with a consumer. Generally, 
these requires two months notice to be given. But in this case as Mr As account was 
restricted before closure, I consider it to have been in practice closed with no notice. There 
are provisions for a no notice closure in the terms, which I have considered. Overall Im 
satisfied that they apply here, and it was reasonable for NatWest to close the account with 
no further notice.
From NatWests records, when asked for proof of entitlement to funds paid into his accounts 
Mr A explained he didnt know the payees personally, but they sent funds in relation to 
investments and businesses Mr A did business with. However there doesnt appear to be 
any documentary evidence to support this. The outbound payments appear to go to another 
account in Mr As name  rather than the investment company Mr A has said they were for. 
From a copy of a contract Mr A has sent our service I can see an agreement between a 
limited company of which he is the director and an investment firm, but this doesnt 
demonstrate to me why he received the funds from the senders to a personal account. I can 
see why NatWest would have concerns, and I cant say that Mr A has demonstrated his 
entitlement to these funds.
On that basis I dont see the amount NatWest returned to Mr A was unreasonable. If Mr A 
cant demonstrate his entitlement to the funds, then NatWest arent under any obligation to 
release them to him. Based on the balance of the account at the point the account was 
restricted, less the deduction of funds where Mr A couldnt demonstrate his entitlement, Im 
satisfied the figure of £14,615.10 is more than fair.
I understand NatWest have now sent the funds to Mr A with the correct details. But if it is 
returned at any point, or there are any further issues, then NatWest should do their best to 
return the funds to Mr A as quickly as possible.
But NatWest did cause further delays in returning the funds by using the wrong name on the 
beneficiary account, and then not being able to locate the funds when they were returned. In 
the circumstances Ive considered the evidence Mr A has submitted about his rent arrears  
but the date of the initial claim against him is from a period I consider it reasonable for 
NatWest to have blocked his account. In any case Ive not seen evidence that persuades me these arrears were down to the actions of NatWest, or that they should reasonably be liable 
for them.
Taking in to account the delays in returning the funds to Mr A, Im satisfied a total of £100 
compensation is a fair reflection of the impact.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must
Ensure the £14,615.10 is returned to Mr A
Pay him £100 compensation

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2023.
