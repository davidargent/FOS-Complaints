The complaint
Mr C complains that Honeycomb Finance Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid 
for some membership credits. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being 
represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr C and his wife entered into a membership application agreement to buy 6,000 
membership credits from a holiday company in May 2018. The membership price was 
£17,100 and Mr C also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Honeycomb Finance 
for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 179 monthly repayments of £174.56 and a final 
payment of £173.93 to Honeycomb Finance. 
Mr C wrote to the holiday company in August 2018 about some issues with his membership 
and it was agreed that, amongst other things, the holiday company would pay him and his 
wife £1,500. Honeycomb Finance confirmed in August 2019 that the loan had been repaid.
Mr Cs representative, on Mr Cs behalf, then made claims to Honeycomb Finance under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in July 2020. It said that: the product 
was misrepresented to Mr C; the contract between Mr C and his wife and the holiday 
company was breached; commission was paid between Honeycomb Finance and the 
holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr C which created a breach of fiduciary duty 
and an unfair relationship; the loan agreement was unaffordable; and the holiday company is 
no longer trading.
Honeycomb Finance said that it was unable to uphold Mr Cs complaint. It said that a new 
management company had been appointed and was able to fully service Mr C and his wifes 
membership in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreement and that Mr C 
and his wife had agreed that a resale facility would be available from 2023. It also said that 
the value of the membership was in the experiences and holidays taken and that the 
membership shouldnt be regard as an investment. Mr C wasnt satisfied with its response so 
a complaint was made to this service. 
Mr Cs complaint form says that: the holiday company and Honeycomb Finance failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; Honeycomb Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him and the holiday company 
unduly pressured him and his wife into entering into the membership application agreement 
and him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mr C and Honeycomb Finance was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He 
thought that Honeycomb Finances checks before it lent to Mr C were reasonable and 
proportionate and he wasnt persuaded that Honeycomb Finance had a reason to think that 
the lending was likely to have been unsustainable and unaffordable for Mr C.
Mr Cs representative, on Mr Cs behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Mr C says that he was told that there was a guaranteed return on investment 
and that the misrepresentation will come to the surface when he tries to sell his credits to be 
told that they arent worth anything. He also says that hes been told that his membership 
continues until 2043 but he wouldnt have signed a contract for that long and he was sold the 
membership on the basis that it was for five years. He says that he didnt mention the return 
on investment and resale value of the credits when he complained to the holiday company in 
August 2018 because he then had no idea that they might not hold any value and it was only 
after being contacted by claims companies and doing some subsequent research that he 
became concerned that what was sold to him may not be as described.
Mr Cs representative says that non-payment of maintenance fees results in the cancellation 
of the membership but not the loan agreement which makes Mr Cs relationship with 
Honeycomb Finance unfair. It has also referred to a decision issued by this service on a 
complaint about a different type of product in which it was found that the management 
charges were unfair. It says that there are significant hidden charges and liabilities found 
within the document for the membership credits which are unfair and which should give rise 
to a successful claim under section 140A. It has also provided a generic submission from 
counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and it has raised its 
serious concerns about the way that the loan was sold to Mr C. It also says that the 
repayments werent affordable and that Mr C repaid the loan utilising a re-mortgage on his 
home.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr C and his wife entered into a membership application agreement in May 2018 to 
buy 6,000 membership credits and paid a membership application fee of £17,100 - I 
understand that they also signed other documents relating to their purchase and 
Mr C electronically signed the loan agreement;
Mr Cs representative made claims to Honeycomb Finance in July 2020 and Mr C 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter referred to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the points were misrepresented to Mr C and his 
wife, but his complaint form only referred to a claim under section 140A and didnt 
refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Cs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Honeycomb 
Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;the July 2020 letter said that the holiday company represented to Mr C and his wife 
that the product was of some substance and that the purchase would be an 
investment as the product would increase in value and, after a few years, they would 
be able to sell it at a considerable profit  but its now clear that the product is 
worthless and has no merit;
Mr C has described the way that the credits were sold to him and his wife  he says 
the credits were described as points based with a limited membership period and 
would allow them to use a unit at a resort and after five years they would be able to 
sell the credits back for a guaranteed profit  he says that he still has the hand 
written note from the salesperson which gave a figure of £4.40 for each credit that 
they could expect when selling them back  and he says that he was told that there 
was a guaranteed return on investment;
Honeycomb Finance has provided a copy of the standard information form that it 
says was given to purchasers by the holiday company  it says that the credits:  
can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a 
yacht or use of other lifestyle products such as luxury cars at various locations ; 
and: This Membership Agreement and Your rights of occupation and/or use shall 
continue from the  Commencement Date for a period of twenty-five years  or 
until  You decide to sell, surrender or transfer [the credits] or utilise all of your 
[credits];
that form also says: The Resale Facility for [credits] will be available to be applied for 
as of the year 2023 and cannot be relied upon as the basis for entering into a 
Membership. Resale values or timeframes cannot be guaranteed and are subject to 
offer and demand;
Honeycomb Finance says that all prospective purchasers attend a compliance 
interview with a compliance manager where every aspect of their purchase is 
explained to them before signing the documentation;
Mr C wrote to the holiday company in August 2018 about some issues with his 
membership and it was agreed that, amongst other things, the holiday company 
would pay him and his wife £1,500, but there was no reference in that letter to the 
credits being worthless or having been sold as an investment  Mr C says that he 
then had no idea that they might not hold any value;
I consider that the credits do have some substance as they can be exchanged for 
rights of occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a yacht or use of other 
lifestyle products such as luxury cars, and Im not persuaded that theyre worthless;
Ive seen no written documentation that refers to a guaranteed return on investment 
and, if Mr C and his wife had been told that they were guaranteed a return on their 
investment, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have ensured 
that it was referred to in the documents that they signed;
Mr C says that he wouldnt have signed a contract for 25 years and he was sold the 
membership on the basis that it was for five years but Ive seen no written 
documentation that refers to the membership being for five years  the standard 
information form says that the resale facility would be available to be applied for from 
2023 (which was five years after Mr C and his wife entered into the membership 
application agreement) but the resale value wasnt guaranteed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
sold the credits to Mr C and his wife as an investment - nor am I persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the credits were misrepresented to Mr C and 
his wife by the holiday company or that they were induced into entering into 
membership application agreement by any such misrepresentations;the July 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has stopped trading so has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract - Honeycomb Finance says that a new 
management company has been appointed and was able to fully service Mr C and 
his wifes membership in accordance with the terms and conditions of their 
agreement - I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach 
of contract for which Honeycomb Finance would be liable under section 75 - but I 
also consider the appointment of the new management company to have been a 
suitable remedy for that breach of contract, and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
Mr C and his wifes use of their credits has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company and Im not persuaded that they would be entitled 
to terminate the membership application agreement in these circumstances;
Mr Cs representative says that commission was paid between Honeycomb Finance 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr C which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship but Honeycomb Finance says that there was 
no commission arrangement between it and the holiday company;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that Honeycomb Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company or to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Honeycomb Finance to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres been 
a breach of any fiduciary duty by Honeycomb Finance in these circumstances;
Mr Cs representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr C and 
Mr Cs complaint form says that the holiday company and Honeycomb Finance failed 
to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan;
Honeycomb Finance says that Mr Cs loan application was underwritten subject to its 
lending criteria at the time which would have included validation of information on the 
application form and a check against a number of databases, including credit 
reference agencies, before arriving at the decision to approve the lending;
Honeycomb Finance has provided evidence to show that Mr C was in full time 
employment with an annual income of £35,235 and that it obtained information from 
him about his expenditure and credit commitments  and it says that it used that 
information to calculate that he had a monthly disposal income of £598.87;
Mr C has provided copies of his bank account statements for the period from 
February to September 2018 but I dont consider that those statements show that the 
loan wasnt affordable for him in May 2018 when it was made to him;
I consider that the checks that were conducted by Honeycomb Finance were 
reasonable and proportionate and I dont consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect Honeycomb Finance to have made more detailed checks about the 
affordability of the loan for Mr C - I find that it was fair and reasonable for it to 
conclude on the basis of the checks that it made that a loan with a monthly payment 
of £174.56 was affordable for Mr C;
Mr Cs representative says that the repayments werent affordable and that Mr C has 
repaid the loan utilising a re-mortgage on his home  the loan was repaid in August 
2019 but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan was 
mis-sold to Mr C, that Honeycomb Finance shouldnt have made the loan to him or 
that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr C about the loan;
Mr C said in his August 2018 letter to the holiday company that he wasnt told that 
the monthly loan repayment would be £174 per month for the term of the loan and 
that he was expecting the payment to be £82  he also says that he was told that the 
loan was for £17,100 and at no point during the sales presentation did anyone tell 
him that the repayable amount was £31,000;Mr C electronically signed the loan agreement which said: As you are entering into 
this agreement electronically, by clicking in the space provided below and confirming, 
you are signing this agreement and agree to be legally bound by its terms; and he 
also confirmed that hed read the pre-contract credit information and the loan 
explanation documents;
I consider that it was clear from the loan agreement and the pre-contract credit 
information that the cash price of the credits and the amount of credit provided to 
Mr C was £17,100, that the total charge for the credit was £14,320.17; that the total 
amount payable was £31,420.17 and that Mr C was to make 179 monthly loan 
repayments of £174.56 and a final payment of £173.93;
Mr Cs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr C and his 
wife into entering into the membership application agreement and Mr C into entering 
into the loan agreement;
Mr C and his wife had the right to withdraw from the membership application 
agreement within 14 calendar days without giving any reason, so if they were 
concerned about the way that the credits had been sold to them and didnt want to 
buy them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted 
the holiday company within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the membership 
application agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that they did so;
the loan agreement that Mr C electronically signed clearly set out his right to 
withdraw from the loan agreement without giving any reason within 14 days, so if 
Mr C was concerned about the way that the loan had been sold to him, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect him to have contacted Honeycomb Finance 
within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the loan agreement but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that he did so;
Mr C wrote to the holiday company in August 2018 about some issues with his 
membership but there was no reference in that letter to him and his wife being unduly 
pressured and he concluded that letter by saying: If you can do all of those things to 
my satisfaction I will be happy to keep the membership and we can all move forward 
happily. I would like to put on record [name of specified person] has been very helpful 
and has responded promptly and effectively to any correspondence from me;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr C and his wife were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement, that Mr C 
was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Cs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and says that non-payment of 
maintenance fees results in the cancellation of the membership but not the loan 
agreement which makes Mr Cs relationship with Honeycomb Finance unfair and it 
has also referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint about a different 
type of product in which it was found that the management charges were unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in those 
agreements were unfair but I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or 
potentially unfair) term alone is likely to mean that a court would conclude that it 
created an unfair relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the court would 
consider how the term operated in practice and whether the operation of that term 
caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr C and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr C and his wife and 
Honeycomb Finance;
the decision referred to by Mr Cs representative related to a fractional holiday 
ownership product which was sold as an investment and related to a specified 
property  Mr C and his wife bought membership credits from the holiday company 
which didnt relate to a specified property and which I dont consider were sold to 
them as an investment;
both products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar contractual 
documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual documentation would 
be significantly different for a fractional product than for the membership credits 
bought by Mr C and his wife;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Cs relationship with 
Honeycomb Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr C and Honeycomb 
Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr C for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership credits but I consider that Honeycomb Finances response to the claims 
that had been made to it was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Honeycomb Finance to 
refund to Mr C any of the money that he's paid under the loan agreement, to pay him 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 October 2023.
