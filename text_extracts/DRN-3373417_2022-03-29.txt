The complaint
Miss H complains PayrNet Limited reviewed her PayrNet account and hasnt returned 
money paid into her account to her. She says this caused her financial problems.
What happened
Miss H had a Pockit account. 
Miss H received her usual Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefit into her 
PayrNet account. And to receive money lent to her by friends and family who occasionally 
helped her out financially.
  
In August 2021, PayrNet reviewed Miss Hs account after she received a payment of £500 
into her account. While the review was carried out PayrNet blocked Miss Hs account which 
meant she couldnt access her account or the money in it.  As part of the review PayrNet 
asked Miss H to provide proof of her identification, address, and source of funds for recent 
payments into her account. 
Miss H provided PayrNet with the documents theyd requested. She also explained that she 
used the account to receive her benefit payments. And that the £500 was money from a 
friend who was helping her out with money.
Over the following months, Miss H sent emails to PayrNet to try and get access to the 
money in her account and to complain about how long PayrNets review was taking. In 
response, PayrNet asked Miss H to provide duplicate information and couldnt provide her 
with a timeframe for how long its review would take to complete. Miss H complained to 
PayrNet and said she was expecting her benefit payment to be credited to her account and 
needed access to the funds to pay her rent and provide for her child. 
On 2 September 2021, during the review, Miss Hs account received her benefit payment of 
just under £700 which was paid into the account by DWP. Due to the block on the account 
Miss H wasnt able to access the money.  
On 29 October 2021, PayrNet wrote to Miss H to let her know it was closing her account and 
asked her to provide a bank statement so that it could release Miss Hs balance back to her. 
Miss H provided a bank statement but PayrNet didnt release any money to her. So, Miss H 
complained. 
PayrNet said it had returned the money in Miss Hs account, including her benefit payment to 
source in December 2021  in other words it had sent it back to where it had come from. 
Miss H checked with DWP, but they said theyd not received Miss Hs September 2021 
payment from PayrNet. Miss H says she was able to confirm that her friend whod made the 
payment of £500 had received the remaining balance back. To date Miss H still hasnt been 
able to recover her September 2021 benefit payment.
Miss H complained to our service. She said being without her benefit money had made it 
difficult for her to manage financially. And that shed not been able to make her rent 
payments. One of our investigators looked into Miss Hs complaint and to try and find out 
where Miss Hs money was, asked PayrNet to provide information that confirmed it had 
actually sent all of Miss Hs benefit payments back to DWP. She also sent PayrNet 
information that Miss H had provided which showed DWP hadnt received the September 
2021 back from PayrNet. But PayrNet didnt provide any useful information to show where it 
had sent Miss Hs benefit payment.
The investigator upheld Miss Hs complaint. While she agreed Payrnet could review and 
block the account, she thought PayrNet should have given Miss H access to her benefit 
payments. And she thought it was likely PayrNet hadnt returned Miss Hs benefit to DWP. 
She said PayrNet should return Miss Hs DWP benefit payment to her along with 8% simple 
interest. And pay her £200 compensation for the trouble and upset shed been caused. 
Miss H agreed. PayrNet didnt respond.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, the investigator was right to point out that PayrNet has important legal and regulatory 
obligations it must meet when providing accounts to customers. And it must take certain 
actions in order to meet these obligations. They can broadly be summarised as a 
responsibility to protect persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial 
crime. Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied that PayrNet were acting in line with these 
obligations when reviewing Miss Hs account. And that it was entitled to take the action it did.
While PayrNet are entitled to review an account, wed expect them to do so in a timely 
manner and without undue delay. PayrNet initially blocked Miss Hs account in August 2021. 
I can see that Miss H provided them with the information theyd requested on two separate 
occasions. I note too that at the end of October 2021 PayRnet told Miss H it was closing her 
account and asked her to provide a bank account statement so that it could release her 
balance back to her. But despite Miss H sending PayrNet a statement it didnt release 
Miss Hs September benefit money back to her. Instead PayrNet says it returned all the 
money in Miss Hs account back to source.
Miss H says she has managed to trace some of the money that was in her account  money 
her friend had lent her and another benefit payment, which DWP confirmed it had received. 
But she cant locate the outstanding benefit payment. And DWP have confirmed it hasnt 
received it back. I find this concerning. Even more concerning is that PayrNet hasnt 
provided anything to show what it did with Miss Hs money. 
Ive thought about what PayrNet has said about their internal transfers and the time it takes. 
But I dont think it is reasonable for a customer not to have access to their money for around 
six months. I can see that Miss H was regularly receiving benefit payments and she provided 
PayrNet with information from the DWP to support what she told them about her benefits. I 
havent seen anything to confirm Miss H wasnt entitled to the benefit money. And therefore, 
Im not satisfied PayrNet has treated Miss H fairly.
Ive also considered Miss Hs individual circumstances. While I appreciate PayrNet are 
entitled to block accounts while carrying out a review, its usually reasonable that a customer still has access to their benefit money. The money Miss H receives is the only source of 
income. Miss H made PayrNet aware of her difficulties and that she was struggling 
financially. But I havent seen anything to suggest PayrNet reached out to her or 
acknowledged she maybe in a vulnerable position. Because of this, I think PayrNet should 
pay Miss H £200 compensation to recognise the trouble and upset caused to her.
Im aware that PayrNet returned an additional credit Miss H received into her account in  
December 2021. Having looked at the information PayrNet relied on to do this, I agree this 
was the right action in the circumstances.
In summary, PayrNet were entitled to review Miss Hs account and suspend it while it did so. 
However, I think they should have allowed Miss H access to her benefit payments. I also 
think they have caused extra distress because Miss H is still without her funds.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. To put things right PayrNet Limited 
should:
Pay Miss H £673.86 (which is her September 2021 benefit payment)
Pay Miss H £200 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by not allowing 
Miss H access to her benefit money
Pay Miss H 8% simple interest on the benefit money she shouldve had access to 
from 2 September 2021 until the date of settlement
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
