K822xcomplaint
Miss M complains that her mortgage lender, National Westminster Bank Plc, told her that 
shed need to evict her tenant when it found  out her tenant was receiving government  
benefits.
Miss M has now moved  her buy-to-let mortgage to another  lender. Miss M would like 
NatWest to refund her early repayment  charge  (ERC), pay the legal fees shes incurred by 
moving her mortgage, and pay her compensation for the stress and upset its caused her.
background 
In January 2018 Miss M took out a capital repayment buy-to-let mortgage with NatWest. 
Miss M was re-mortgaging her buy-to-let  mortgage from another lender. The mortgage was 
taken out through a broker. Miss M borrowed around £49,500 over 12 years. The mortgage 
was on a five year fixed rate of 3.19% until 2023. Miss M already had a tenant living in the 
property with a good payment history. 
In September  2018 Miss M contacted  NatWest  to apply for a further advance. As part of her 
discussions with NatWest,  a mortgage  advisor became aware that Miss Ms tenant  was 
receiving benefits. Miss M was told that she wouldnt be able to get a further advance 
because she didnt  meet  NatWests lending criteria. She was also told that she shouldnt 
have been given the mortgage in the first place. NatWest gave her the choice of evicting her 
tenant or moving  her mortgage  to another lender. If Miss M were  to move her mortgage 
elsewhere this would result in Miss M paying an ERC of around £2,500.
Miss M was very upset and felt that NatWest was putting her in an impossible situation. She 
wasnt willing to evict her tenant because the tenant was on benefits but she couldnt afford 
to pay the ERC and incur the costs  of moving her mortgage to another lender. She 
complained to NatWest.
NatWest gave its final response on the matter on 28 September  2018. NatWest  didnt think it 
had made  a mistake. It said Miss Ms broker hadnt  disclosed that she had a tenant receiving 
benefits when  shed applied for the mortgage.  If it had, Miss M wouldnt have been given the 
mortgage as this was outside  of NatWests lending criteria. It said the broker  would have 
known this at the time of selecting suitable  buy-to-let mortgages  for Miss M to apply for.
Miss M was unhappy with NatWests response and brought her complaint  to us. Our 
investigator looked into the matter. While  the complaint has been with us NatWest has 
changed its position. It still says the broker was at fault for selecting  a NatWest buy-to-let 
mortgage for Miss M, knowing that her tenancy  didnt meet its lending criteria.  However,  it 
agreed that it had made a mistake  and it shouldnt have given Miss M the choice of evicting 
her tenant  or moving her mortgage elsewhere  when  it realised her tenant  was receiving 
benefits. NatWest has offered Miss M £500 compensation for the upset it has caused  her. It 
also offered to let Miss M take out another mortgage and waive associated fees of up to 
£995. It wouldnt refund the ERC  because  it had learned that the broker had already offered 
to cover this cost.
Our investigator thought the complaint should be upheld. He thought NatWest should  refund 
the ERC  and pay Miss M £500 for the trouble and upset it had caused her.
Miss M didnt agree with the investigators findings. She replied to say, in summary:
Ref: DRN68970852-NatWest only accepted it made a mistake when shed referred  her complaint to us, 
and after shed  started a petition  and spoken to the press;
-she thinks NatWest has shown no duty of care to consumers or society  in general; 
and
-she doesnt consider  the investigators proposed way of putting things right is enough  
to teach NatWest any lessons. Miss Ms worried theres no reason for NatWest to 
change corrupt ways  and that there  doesnt  seem to be a penalty  to them.
my provisional findings
On 25 March 2019 I issued a provisional decision setting out what I thought needed to 
happen to resolve  this dispute. My provisional  decision  said:
Miss Ms application for a buy-to-let  mortgage  
In early 2018 Miss M took out an unregulated buy-to-let  mortgage with NatWest.  Miss M 
already had a mortgage with another lender and she had an existing tenant.
Miss M has said that she told her broker  that her tenant was receiving housing benefits. 
Shed also shared her bank statements with the broker  and NatWest  to confirm  the rental 
income she was receiving. I can understand why Miss M was so surprised when NatWest 
later said she was in breach of her mortgages term and conditions and that it hadnt been  
aware until then that her tenant was on benefits.  Miss M hadnt hidden  this fact and shed 
happily shared  all the information  shed  been  asked to when she applied  for the mortgage  
months before.
Miss Ms broker  has said that it knew that her tenant  was receiving benefits. NatWest  has 
shared with us the policy guidelines made available to brokers at the time. Im satisfied that 
NatWests lending policy didnt allow  lending  to landlords where  the tenants were  in receipt 
of benefits. If Miss Ms broker  had told NatWest this information at the time of the 
application, NatWest  wouldnt have offered her the mortgage.
Im aware that NatWest has now reviewed and changed its lending  policy  on this particular 
issue. Even if it hadnt, NatWest is able to determine  what eligibility criteria it wishes to set 
for new lending. It isnt for me to determine  whether its eligibility  criteria creates a social 
injustice for the wider  population, although I wholly appreciate the arguments Miss M has 
made. 
It seems  likely to me that Miss Ms broker failed to identify that her financial situation didnt 
meet NatWests lending  criteria. As a result  of the brokers error, Miss M ended up with a 
buy-to-let mortgage  where she didnt meet the lending criteria. Im persuaded that this didnt 
become apparent to the broker,  NatWest  or Miss M for some months until Miss M spoke to 
NatWest directly about a further advance.
Miss Ms broker  has accepted responsibility  for arranging a mortgage that wasnt appropriate 
for her needs. The broker has since undertaken to find Miss M a replacement mortgage that 
is suitable for her tenancy, and it said it will reimburse her for the costs  of her exiting her 
NatWest mortgage  and taking out new borrowing elsewhere.
Because the broker has already agreed  to compensate  Miss M for the ERC and other 
associated costs of her taking out another buy-to-let mortgage, I think it would be unfair  to 
also ask NatWest to refund the cost of the ERC. That would mean  that Miss M receives  this 
Ref: DRN68970853compensation twice.  Miss M has also asked if NatWest would pay for around £1,200 of legal 
fees associated  with her re-mortgage. Again, I consider this is part of the compensation 
offered by her broker.
Miss M has queried why NatWest didnt check the source of her rental  income at the time 
the mortgage was applied  for. NatWest has said it checked the amount of rental  income she 
was getting each month by referring  to her bank statements, but it didnt independently  verify 
the source of the funds of the rent.
Miss M took out an unregulated buy-to-let mortgage with NatWest.  The mortgage regulations 
that apply to regulated lending wouldnt have applied to NatWests decision to lend.  But, for 
the purposes of considering what might be deemed  good industry  practice in such a lending  
assessment, Ive looked at what would be expected in a mortgage  transaction  if it was 
regulated. And Ive considered the checks lenders are required to make  when lending 
regulated consumer  buy-to-let mortgages  (Miss Ms mortgage isnt one of those).  In 
particular Ive thought about what income  checks lenders should complete and how this 
might translate to Miss Ms buy-to-let application.
In general I dont consider there  was an expectation on the lender to verify exactly  where the 
rental payments were coming from. NatWest  wanted  to check  that the declared rental 
income figure was the same as the amount Miss M was receiving into her bank account, and 
it used Miss Ms bank statements to verify this. This is in keeping with the obligations for 
regulated lending. If this was a regulated consumer buy-to-let mortgage,  NatWest would be 
required to carry out necessary, sufficient and proportionate checks. I think checking that 
Miss M is actually receiving rent  without  going  on to investigate  how the tenant raises  the 
funds to pay it  meets  that test.
NatWest also undertook a market  valuation to make sure the monthly rental figure  was 
considered to be at a realistic level for the local rental market.  This seems prudent and in 
line with checking  that Miss Ms rental income would be able to safely sustain mortgage 
repayments. Im not persuaded that NatWest had a further duty to trace where  the rental 
payments were originating from, whether as a matter of law, regulation or good industry 
practice. 
NatWests actions when  the breach in its lending policy  came  to light
NatWest has now apologised to Miss M for the way it handled  things in September 2018, 
when it realised Miss Ms tenant  was receiving benefits. Having looked at the evidence  from 
the time,  I can see why Miss M was so upset by the way NatWest handled the situation. 
Miss M was understandably shocked to learn she was in breach of her mortgage conditions.  
And she was even more  distressed to be presented with the choice  to evict her tenant  or 
move her mortgage to another  lender  and pay an ERC of around  £2,500.  Miss M made  it 
clear she wasnt willing  to make her tenant homeless. Her tenant  was reliable, had no history  
of payment default  and Miss M considered  her vulnerable.
I sympathise with the dilemma  that Miss M found  herself in and I can completely understand 
why, having heard NatWests final response on the matter, she felt she had no choice but to 
move her mortgage to another  lender.  I am also mindful of the time and energy she has put 
into complaining  about the fairness of NatWests lending policy.  Miss M has clearly spent 
significant time and effort  on the issue, including making her complaint to NatWest and us, 
and sorting out a new mortgage via her broker.
Ref: DRN68970854what do I think needs to happen now to put things right? 
Ive already said that Miss Ms broker was responsible for her getting  a buy-to-let mortgage 
with NatWest. Her broker has admitted responsibility  for this and it has said it will pay the 
costs involved in Miss M taking her mortgage to another  lender.
Im pleased to see Miss M now has this mortgage  set up and that this was sorted  out via her 
broker. I trust that her broker has honoured  its pledge to pay for all the costs involved in Miss 
M getting  a new mortgage that was right for her needs.
Because Miss Ms broker has already covered  the costs involved in repaying the mortgage 
including the ERC  and the legal fees,  I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest  to duplicate 
these costs. Miss M has had this loss covered by the party responsible  for this mistake 
already.
As such,  I think it falls to NatWest to pay compensation to Miss M for its customer service 
and treatment of her when she applied for a further  advance and in its handling of her 
complaint. NatWest has said that it shouldnt have told Miss M she needed to evict her 
tenant or move her mortgage  to another lender. It took around a month  for this failing to be 
identified and corrected.  Im persuaded that this caused Miss M significant distress  and 
upset. NatWest has offered £500 for the upset it caused Miss M through  the shortcomings in 
its customer service.  Overall I think that is fair and reasonable  in settlement of the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As neither Miss M nor NatWest made any 
further comments for me to consider, I see no reason to change  my earlier  findings.  This 
final decision  confirms the outcome  reached in my provisional decision.  
my final decision
My final decision is that this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc should be 
upheld.
I direct  National Westminster Bank  Plc to pay Miss M £500 for the trouble and upset it 
caused by its conduct  when it realised  Miss M was in breach of her mortgage terms.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 June  2019.
