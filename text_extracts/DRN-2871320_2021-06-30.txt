DRN-2871320
The complaint
Mr B complains about end of contract charges when his agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services UK Limited ended.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I didnt uphold this complaint. In summary, I 
concluded that the damage which MBFS had asked Mr B to pay charges for exceeded 
acceptable wear and tear, having regard to the BVLRA guidelines. 
In particular I disagreed with the investigator and said that the damage to the right-hand rear 
door shut inner wasnt within acceptable wear and tear because I could see a dent in the 
photos which was more than 10mm in diameter. I could also see that the paint was broken. 
The guidelines say that damage isnt acceptable if the paint is broken.
Neither party responded to my provisional decision. The case has been referred to me to 
review once more.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has responded to my provisional decision. Therefore, I see no reason to reach 
different conclusions to those which I reached in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. I wont be asking MBFS to remove any 
of the charges.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2021.
