The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed his accounts without 
providing an explanation or warning. Mr R says this caused him unnecessary inconvenience 
and worry for which he should be compensated.
What happened
Mr R had six accounts with NatWest  a current account and five savings accounts. Mr R 
has explained that he used his savings account to save a deposit for an upcoming house 
purchase.
In July 2022, NatWest decided to review how Mr R was operating his accounts. Whilst it 
conducted its review the bank blocked Mr Rs access to all of his accounts, this meant Mr R 
couldnt access the funds in his accounts and no payments could be credited to the account. 
Mr R was also blocked from accessing his accounts online. Mr Rs accounts were blocked 
from 22 July 2022 until 2 August 2022. Following this NatWest decided to close Mr Rs 
accounts and wrote to him on 24 August 2022, giving him 60 days notice that it intended to 
close his accounts. 
Mr R says he only discovered his accounts were blocked when he tried to access his 
accounts. Hes explained that he went into a branch to find out what was happening with his 
accounts, but NatWest wouldnt give him much information. He also says that he never 
received the notice to closure letter which NatWest sent, so he had no idea his accounts 
were going to be closed. 
NatWest closed Mr Rs accounts on 25 October 2022. It released Mr Rs funds on 6 
December 2022. 
Mr R complained to the bank about the block and closure of his accounts. He explained that 
hed been a customer of the bank for over ten years and had always operated his accounts 
properly. He said at the time he and his wife had just had a baby and were in the process of 
buying and selling a property. So not having access to a working bank account made an 
already challenging time in his life more difficult and stressful. He says NatWest treated him 
inhumanely.
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it blocked and closed Mr Rs 
accounts. And it had done so in line with the account terms and its regulatory obligations.
Mr R wasnt happy with this response, so he brought his complaint to our service where an 
investigator considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about 
why it had blocked and closed Mr Rs accounts. But NatWest said it couldnt provide 
anything more than it had already provided to us. And maintained that it hadnt treated Mr R 
unfairly when it had blocked and closed his accounts.
The investigator said that  based on the limited information NatWest had provided she 
wasnt satisfied that NatWest had treated Mr R fairly when it had blocked and closed his 
accounts. She also said that NatWest had taken too long to return Mr Rs money to him after 
his accounts had closed. So, she said NatWest should pay Mr R £200 compensation for any 
trouble and upset the closure of his accounts had caused him. She also recommended 
NatWest pay Mr R 8% interest on the balances of his accounts for loss of use of his funds.  
NatWest accepted what the investigator said. Mr R didnt. He said that the amount of 
compensation doesnt adequately reflect the amount of trouble and upset he has suffered. 
He wants NatWest to receive a hefty fine and reopen his accounts. He also wants the bank 
to explain why it no longer wants him as a customer.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr R wants NatWest to explain the reason it blocked and closed his accounts. Mr R has said 
that at the time he and his wife had recently had a baby. And they were also in the process 
of selling a property and looking for a new home. Hes said that his wife was also dealing 
with some health issues. So, I can understand why he found this whole experience with 
NatWest frustrating  especially as his attempts to get information from NatWest about what 
was happening didnt give him any answers. But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers 
what triggers a review of their accounts. Its under no obligation to tell Mr R the reasons 
behind the account block and closure, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done 
anything wrong by not giving Mr R this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to 
require it do so. 
However, NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a 
complaint. Despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest has failed to provide 
information about why it  blocked Mr Rs accounts and no longer wanted him as a customer. 
Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further information to our 
service about the reasons it blocked and closed Mr Rs accounts. This service has the power 
to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im not 
persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, in 
this particular case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest has 
treated Mr R fairly when it blocked and closed his accounts. Ive considered what Mr R has 
said about how NatWests actions impacted him. Taking this into account, I agree NatWest 
should pay Mr R compensation for the trouble and upset caused by blocking and closing his 
accounts.  
NatWest agreed to pay £200 as recommended by the investigator. Mr R says this doesnt go 
far enough. Having considered what Mr R has told us about how NatWests actions 
impacted him, Ive no doubt this was a worrying and upsetting time for him. He also had to 
go to the trouble of finding and opening new bank accounts. But having looked at all the 
evidence and circumstances of this complaint, I havent found grounds to increase the level 
of compensation. I know Mr R has said that not having access to his account led to him not 
being able to purchase a property. And having to move in with family instead. But Ive not 
seen any evidence to support this. So, Im satisfied that £200 compensation is a fair amount 
of compensation and proportionate to the trouble and upset Mr R was caused by NatWest 
blocking and closing his accounts. Mr Rs accounts were blocked from 22 July 2022 until 2 
August 2022, so NatWest should also pay Mr R 8% simple interest on the balances of his 
accounts, for loss of use of his funds during this period.
NatWest closed Mr Rs accounts on 25 October 2022, but it didnt release Mr Rs funds until 
6 December 2022. The longer a customer doesnt have access to the money in their account, the greater the trouble, upset and financial harm they may suffer. Mr R has said not 
having access to the funds in his accounts was stressful and made everyday life for him and 
his family much more difficult at a time which was already challenging for them.
 
Ive looked at the timeline of events and what NatWest has said it was doing at the time. But 
I cant see any reason why the bank took as long as it did to release Mr Rs balance to him. 
Based on the limited information they have provided I cant fairly conclude they have acted 
as they should have. Instead, I find they have likely caused unreasonable delays and havent 
treated Mr R fairly. So, NatWest should pay Mr R 8% simple interest on the balances of his 
accounts from 25 October 2022 until 6 December 2022, for loss of use of these funds. 
I know that Mr R wants NatWest to reopen his accounts. Although NatWest havent provided 
this service with the reasons why it no longer wants Mr R as a customer. I am not going to 
ask NatWest to reopen Mr Rs accounts. Thats because it has the commercial freedom to 
decide who it wants as a customer.
I understand Mr R feels NatWest should be punished for the way it has treated him. He 
wants NatWest to receive a fine of £200,000, which he wants donated to charity. I 
understand Mr Rs strength of feeling about his complaint. But its important to note that it 
isnt the role of this service to punish or fine businesses for their mistakes or standard of 
service. This service isnt intended to regulate or punish businesses for their conduct  that 
is the role of the Financial Conduct Authority. Instead, this service looks to resolve individual 
complaints between a consumer and business. Should we decide that something has gone 
wrong we would ask a business to put things right by placing a customer, as far as possible, 
in the position they would have been in if the problem hadnt occurred. 
In summary, based on the evidence Im satisfied that NatWests blocking and closing Mr Rs 
accounts caused Mr R trouble and upset. Mr R also had to wait more than a month for the 
bank to return his funds after it had closed his accounts. I think adding interest to the 
balances of his accounts fairly compensates him for the loss of use of his money. I also think 
NatWest should pay compensation for the trouble and upset this overall situation has caused 
Mr R and I consider the amount of £200 to be appropriate in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should: 
Pay Mr R £200 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the NatWest 
blocking and closing his accounts
Pay Mr R 8% simple interest per year for the sum in Mr Rs accounts between 22 
July 2022 until 2 August 2022 
Pay Mr R 8% simple interest per year for the sum in Mr Rs accounts between 25 
October 2022 and 6 December 2022
HM Revenue & Customs require National Westminster Bank Plc to withhold income tax 
from the abovementioned interest. NatWest should give Mr R a certificate showing how 
much is taken off if he asks for one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2023.
