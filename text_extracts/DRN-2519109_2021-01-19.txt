The complaint
Mr S complains NewDay Ltd ( NewDay) trading as Aqua acted irresponsibly when they 
increased his credit card account limit.
What happened
Mr S had a credit card account with NewDay and on two occasions, within a period of seven
months his credit card account limit was increased. Mr S says that on the second occasion
the credit card limit was increased by NewDay, they didnt carry out sufficient checks to
ensure he could afford the increase. Mr S says he is now in financial difficulty and NewDay
havent been helpful when he informed them of this. Mr S has asked for all interest and
charges to be refunded and the account written off.
NewDay says that they carried out their normal credit assessment when granting the
increased credit card limit and considered Mr Ss financial situation when approving the
increased limit on both occasions. NewDay says that Mr S was given the opportunity not to
take up the increase if he wished. NewDay offered Mr S £50 by way of compensation for the
poor customer service he received once hed informed them of his financial circumstances.
Mr S wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mr Ss complaint. The
investigator felt that NewDay could have done more when carrying out their affordability
checks and says he didnt feel their actions were proportionate to the credit limit given to Mr
S. The investigator told NewDay to refund the interest and charges made to the credit card
account and buy back the debt and put right his credit file.
NewDay werent happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to
an ombudsman for a final decision.
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to the investigator and I will explain how
I have come to my decision.
I was sorry to hear of the stress Mr S has experienced as a result of the financial situation he
finds himself in. When looking at this complaint I have considered if NewDay should have
done more here when granting the increased credit card limit for Mr S and whether the
checks they carried out were proportionate and reasonable. I have also considered if
NewDay acted reasonably when they were informed of Mr Ss financial situation.
Looking at the first part of Mr Ss complaint, what happened here is Mr S originally applied
for a credit card account with NewDay which was initially set with a limit of £300 in May
2017, this was increased by NewDay to £900 in August 2017 and then in December 2017
increased to £1650. Mr S says when the limit was increased to £1650 NewDay should have
carried out further checks and this would have shown them his circumstances had changed
and he had increased debt elsewhere.
I have considered the point Mr S makes, this is central to his complaint and I have focussed
at the time the limit on his credit card was increased to £1650 from £900 as this is when Mr
S says NewDay could have done more in the way of financial checks. When considering a
complaint such as this we look to see if the checks carried out by NewDay or any bank, are
considered to be reasonable and proportionate. What is worth mentioning is that NewDay
did carry out credit checks before the credit limit on Mr Ss credit card was increased to
£1650. One of the considerations I need to make is whether the checks undertaken were
proportionate to the level of increased borrowing offered. In this case Mr S declared an
income of £16575 on his original credit card application and from what I understand that was
based on average weekly earnings, which at the time of the increase to £1650 hadnt
changed and if it had this hadnt been made known to NewDay.
When looking at the level of credit provided against income then the limit offered doesnt
look unreasonable. That of course isnt the only consideration when banks, like NewDay,
increase consumers credit limits. In this case NewDay looked at previous financial data
provided via credit reference agencies and from what I have seen, while these show other
obligations, these didnt indicate any undue financial stress. The credit limit on Mr Ss credit
card was utilised fully prior to the increase, but this style of account is set with modest limits
at the outset and then reviewed and potentially increased subject to NewDays internal credit
procedures and this is what happened here. There is an instance of an over limit recorded
leading up to the increase but its also fair to say to counter this there had also been
occasions when more than the minimum payment was made to Mr Ss credit card account.
So, on balance, considering the other information available at that time to NewDay, this over
limit wouldnt be a reason alone, not to offer a higher level of credit commensurate to Mr Ss
income. From the information I have seen this was taken into account when NewDay carried
out their credit assessment.
I have considered whether or not this level of increase was sustainable and from what I have
seen I am satisfied at the point of the increase of Mr Ss limit there was nothing to suggest it
wasnt. I say this as Mr S lived with his parents at home with a declared income and up until
the credit card limit was increased, he had fairly modest other financial commitments. I also
understand that Mr Ss income may not have been as regular as his declared income
implied, but I cant see how NewDay would have known that unless it was offered to them.
Its worth mentioning, in the offer letter provided by NewDay it does say Before you decide
what to do you should ask yourself if you can afford to pay back the new limit and if anything
is likely to change that may mean you would have difficulty in paying it back.
I am satisfied if Mr S was experiencing financial problems at the time his limit was increased,
he was offered the opportunity to have raised it at that time. What is evident, is some time
after the increased credit card limit, Mr Ss financial situation seems to have deteriorated and
then became very difficult once Mr S lost his job, but that was after the increased limit was
approved so I cant see that NewDay could have foreseen this. It follows I dont feel that 
NewDay failed to carry out proportionate checks for the reasons I
have given here.
The second part of the complaint concerns how Mr S was treated by NewDay when they
were made aware of his financial problems. What happened here was almost a year after
the credit card limit was increased Mr S informed NewDay he had lost his job and needed
support. NewDay responded to this by placing a 30 day hold on the account giving him time
to complete an income and expenditure form they sent. Mr S says he never received the
form to complete and NewDay say the next they heard from Mr S was in June 2019, and heshould have contacted them sooner. Like the investigator I do think that NewDay could have
done more to have followed this up knowing Mr S was experiencing financial issues. From
the information provided to this service Mr S also contacted NewDay in January 2019
reiterating his financial situation.
Mr S contacted NewDay with a partially completed income and expenditure form in June
2019. While I agree, that in itself wouldnt be sufficient for NewDay to have made a proper
assessment, like the investigator I feel rather than simply sending a letter requesting a call
back, NewDay knowing the problems Mr S was facing could have done more at that point to
support him. Having said that I dont think it was unreasonable for NewDay to try and
contact Mr S by phone and I can see no evidence to support Mr S was harassed on those
occasions.
While Mr S will be disappointed with my decision, I am satisfied NewDay carried out
proportionate and reasonable checks when increasing Mr Ss credit card limit. I do feel
NewDay could have done more to support him when they were informed of his financial
problems and agree with the investigator a small level of compensation is warranted here to
reflect this. NewDay have agreed to pay £50 to Mr S which I feel is fair and reasonable and
Mr S should contact NewDay if he wishes to accept this offer.
I gave both Mr S and NewDay until 11January 2021 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. NewDay have accepted my provisional decision, but I have not heard anything 
further from Mr S, so the case has been passed back to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I see no need to change or add to my provisional decision, so my final decision remains the 
same.
NewDay have confirmed the £50 compensation offered is still available to Mr S but they  
require his bank account details in order to make the payment, so I will leave it with Mr S to 
contact NewDay to arrange this . 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2021.
