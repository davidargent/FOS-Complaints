K820x#14complaint
Mr K doesnt  think Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL) has offered him fair 
compensation following a complaint about the sale of a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy.
background
Mr K took out a PPI policy with a store card in June 2001.
In 2018, he contacted FICL to say the PPI policy  had been mis-sold.  FICL agreed and 
offered to refund the extra hed paid for PPI (including interest). It also offered to pay simple 
interest (at 8% per year) for any periods when he was out of pocket.  In total, it offered to pay 
Mr K £108.77 (after tax).
Mr K didnt think this was enough  and referred  his complaint to our service.
FICL revised  its offer when our adjudicator  pointed  out a mistake it had made. The refund of 
premiums and interest stayed the same (£10.21 and £86.16 respectively). But the simple 
interest payment  increased from £12.40 to £86.93 (after tax).
Our adjudicator thought the revised offer was fair. Mr K disagrees  he still thinks  he paid 
more.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
FICL says it knows how much Mr K was charged  in PPI premiums over the life of his 
account. It has sent us screenshots  of its internal records, which show  Mr K was charged  
£10.21 for PPI.
Mr K has sent us and FICL three statements. He says these show  he paid more for PPI. I 
disagree and Ill explain why.
Two of the statements  provided are clear  and legible. The statement dated 18 May 2002 
shows an account balance of £358.41 (before  PPI was added)  and a PPI premium  of £3.58. 
The statement  dated 18 June 2002  shows a balance of £344.81 (before PPI was added) and 
a PPI premium of £3.45.
The other statement  is only partially  legible. It is dated 18 November 2001.  Some 
transactions are very clear, while others are slightly blurred but still legible. Unfortunately, 
the two values that are completely illegible are those next to the PPI transactions dated 
18 October 2001 and 18 November  2001. But its possible  to work out what  these values 
are.
The opening  balance  is £255.64 and the statement closing balance  is £282.45.
A late payment  charge  of £15 was added on 11 November 2001 and two interest charges 
of £5.70 and £6.11 were added on 18 October 2001  and 18 November 2001 respectively. 
The only other transactions on the statement are the two illegible PPI transactions. But the 
Ref: DRN49486442sum of the legible transactions is £26.81. And this is the difference between the opening 
balance and the statement balance: £282.45  less £255.64 is £26.81. Im therefore satisfied 
that, for whatever reason, the illegible values are both £0.00.
This means  Mr K wasnt charged anything for PPI in October  2001  or November 2001, 
despite having a balance  in excess of his credit limit.
Mr K says he had a balance of £250 for most  of the time he had the store  card. I accept hes 
probably right. But that doesnt  mean he paid more than £10.21  for PPI. The November 
statement shows that he wasnt  charged  for PPI every month. And I havent seen any 
evidence which indicates that FICLs records are wrong.
Whats more, those same  records indicate  that Mr K was charged £153.39 in interest over 
the life of the account. And FICL  has offered to refund  £86.16 of this. 
I appreciate that the way it has calculated Mr Ks PPI compensation  doesnt  reflect  the 
known statement data.  But its offered to refund more than 50% of the interest charged.  And 
by Mr Ks own admission,  he maintained a balance  close to, or in excess  of, his credit  limit 
for a long time.  I think its very unlikely  the £10.21 he was charged  for PPI was responsible  
for more than 50% of the interest he was charged. So I think this part of the offer is more 
than fair.
Finally, I think  FICL has calculated simple interest in the way Id expect.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I think Financial  Insurance Company Limited has 
offered Mr K fair compensation. If its already paid him, it doesnt need  to do anything.  If it 
hasnt, it should  pay him the amount its offered.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 October  2019.
