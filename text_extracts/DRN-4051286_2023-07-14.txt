The complaint
Mr W complains PrePay Technologies Limited unfairly closed his business account and 
havent released funds he held in the account.
What happened
Mr W held a business account with one of PrePays agents. To keep things simple, Ill refer 
to PrePay in this decision.
PrePay decided to close Mr Ws account in October 2021. They asked Mr W for an 
alternative account to send the funds they held, and for a statement for the nominated 
account issued within the last three months to verify him as the account holder. Mr W didnt 
think PrePay were entitled to receive a statement.
Mr W brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator told him it was standard practice 
for firms to ask for statements to verify accounts they were sending payments to. Mr W sent 
our investigator a statement, which they forwarded to PrePay on 18 January 2023.
Our investigator upheld Mr Ws complaint in part. They said:
- PrePay could review and then close Mr Ws account in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account and their legal and regulatory obligations. They didnt have 
to disclose their reasons to him.
- Based on the information PrePay provided to our service, they should have given   
Mr W two months notice before closing his account. They should pay him £200 for 
the inconvenience he experienced.
- PrePay acted reasonably by asking Mr W for an account statement to verify he held 
the account where he wanted his funds transferred. Mr W has now provided a 
statement, so PrePay should transfer the funds.
PrePay rejected the investigators recommendation, so the complaint was given to me to 
make a final decision in my capacity as an ombudsman. Prior to making this final decision, I 
told PrePay that I was inclined to agree with our investigators findings, but I was also 
inclined to award 8% simple interest per annum on the balance they held. 
PrePay responded to say they would now accept the investigators original findings, but as I 
find additional compensation is appropriate above what our investigator recommend, Ive 
proceeded to make a final decision, so Mr W has the opportunity to accept my final decision, 
which would make it binding on PrePay.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PrePay have a broad commercial discretion to close customer accounts. But they should 
ensure they close an account in line with the terms of the account, which constitutes their 
agreement with Mr W. Here, PrePay acted in a way which effectively meant Mr Ws account 
was closed immediately. He didnt have access to his account from 13 October 2021. 
There are specific terms that allow PrePay to close an account immediately. The relevant 
terms state:
We may on immediate notice terminate these () Terms where we have reason to believe 
that any of the following happen:
you have been suspended for a period of 90 days and you have failed to remediate 
the cause for suspension;
you seriously or repeatedly broke these () Terms;
we reasonably think that you might put us in breach of law or regulation;
we discover that any of the information you've provided is false or misleading;
you stop meeting our eligibility criteria;
you have infringed on () or any third partys intellectual property;
you are behind in payment of fees and have not remedied this non-payment within 
five (5) days of () providing you with notice of the non-payment; or
you are subject to a bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or other similar event. 
Our investigator provided their reasons on why they found PrePay failed to show they could 
immediately close the account. I have drawn the same conclusions after carefully reviewing 
the information available. Im not satisfied PrePay have established any of the above criteria 
was met for the terms to be reasonably applied.
PrePay told our investigator the notice period they give is entirely at their discretion. But their 
terms and conditions set out express criteria to close an account immediately. Im not 
satisfied they have made a persuasive case to override these terms in the individual 
circumstances of Mr W. So, while they could close his account, I find they ought to have 
given him two months notice, and he ought to have had use of the account for that two-
month period.
Mr W said he had to make other arrangements to receive payments from clients. But given 
PrePay could close his account, he would have always had to make alternative 
arrangements. But I find its likely he was frustrated by the immediate closure, and he would 
have experienced more profound inconvenience by having to make arrangements straight 
away. Im satisfied £200 is reasonable compensation to make up for this.PrePay required Mr W to provide a statement for his nominated account. Im satisfied this 
was a reasonable due diligence measure in line with their legal and regulatory 
responsibilities. Mr W eventually provided a statement to our service which was forwarded to 
PrePay on 18 January 2023. I find they ought to have made the payment no more than one 
week from when they were sent the statement  in this case by 25 January 2023.
If PrePay failed to transfer the funds to Mr W by this time I find they ought to pay eight 
percent simple interest on the balance from 26 January 2023 until the time they made or will 
make payment. This is to represent the loss Mr W might have experienced by not having use 
of his funds when he should have. 
Putting things right
Subject to Mr W accepting this decision, I require PrePay Technologies Limited to:
- Pay him £200 for the distress and inconvenience he was caused due to closing his 
business account in a way which was equivalent to an immediate closure.
- Pay him the balance they held if it has not already been paid to him.
- If PrePay failed to pay the balance they held by 26 January 2023, they need to pay 
eight percent simple interest on the balance they held/hold until the time they have 
paid Mr W the funds. If PrePay considers that theyre required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to deduct income tax from that interest, they should tell Mr W how much 
theyve taken off. They should also give Mr W a tax deduction certificate if he asks, 
so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
My decision is I uphold Mr Ws complaint. PrePay Technologies Limited must put things right 
according to my instructions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2023.
