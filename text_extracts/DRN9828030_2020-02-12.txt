Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Bs complaint in part and thought loans  5 onwards shouldnt have 
been given. Uncle Buck disagreed so the complaint was passed  to me.
I reached a different conclusion and in my provisional decision (which  forms part of this final 
decision) I set out why I was planning  to uphold the complaint in part for loans 1, 3, 5 and 6. I 
asked Mr B and Uncle Buck to let me have any more information  by 20 February 2020 
before I made a final decision.
Both parties  responded prior to this deadline. Mr B said he was happy  with my provisional 
decision and Uncle Buck said it had nothing further  to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Neither party sent in any additional  information, evidence or comments  in response  to my 
provision decision.  So it follows I have no reason to change the findings or outcome I set out 
in my provisional decision.  
I am upholding  this complaint in part for loans 1, 3, 5 and 6.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr B paid on loans 1,3, 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 1 and 3 from Mr Bs credit file
the number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 5 and 6 should be 
removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.

My decision  is I uphold  this complaint in part. Uncle Buck Finance LLP must  pay Mr B 
compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020.

background
This complaint is about  six short-term high-cost loans  Uncle Buck  provided to Mr B between
March 2016 and September 2017.  They  were repayable in three instalments. This is a summary of Mr 
Bs lending  history from Uncle Buck.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Bs complaint in part and thought loans 5 onwards shouldnt have been  
given. Uncle Buck disagreed and responded in full. In summary,  it said:
it would  not be right to remove any information  from Mr Bs credit file;
there was a clear non-borrowing gap of over four months between loans 3 and 4;
Mr B applied for further  borrowing after complaining these six loans were unaffordable;
his borrowing history doesnt evidence  reliance on its short-term loans;
checks  showed loan 5 was affordable: Mr B repaid  it in line with the agreement and there was a 
clear gap of 10 days after the repayment of loan 4; 
likewise the checks completed for loan 6 showed it was affordable  and sustainable; and 
it expects applicants to provide accurate information at application.
So the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. We set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-term 
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.
Uncle Buck needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In
practice this means  that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr B
could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a
number of different things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN98280304But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to meet  
a higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which  a customer has been given loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Uncle  Buck was required to establish
whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a
consumer could sustainably  make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit  Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable
as being without  undue difficulties and in particular  the customer should be able to
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without
having to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows  that a lender should  realise, or it
ought fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context and what  this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
The adjudicator concluded  Uncle Buck  wasnt wrong to give loans  1 to 4 to Mr B. But I disagree that it 
was right to give loans  1 and 3 to Mr B. 
Uncle Buck has outlined in detail how it checks affordability and creditworthiness before agreeing to 
lend. Im satisfied it carried out proportionate checks for loans 1 to 4. And I havent found  anything in 
the information it gathered to suggest it should have made  a different lending decision for loans 2 and 
4. 
But I think it was wrong to give Mr B loans  1 and 3. Whilst the loan repayments may have been 
affordable on a pounds and pence  basis,  this wasnt all that Uncle Buck had to consider. It had to 
make sure the loans were sustainably affordable. And in both cases I think Mr B was left without 
enough disposable income - after the loan repayments. For loan 1 he would have had less than £50 
and for loan 3 just over £60. As a responsible  lender think Uncle  Buck ought to have realised loans  1 
and 3 were  not sustainably affordable for 
Mr B given his circumstances, and were  most likely to be harmful.  So it was wrong  to give loans 1 and 
3.
Ive then looked at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending history with Mr B, with a view
to seeing if there was a point  at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle Buck  should  have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans until there was a significant  gap in lending.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point  was reached at
Ref: DRN98280305loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr B was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably.  Mr B had been indebted  to Uncle Buck  for 12 out of the previous 16 
months. So Uncle Buck  ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr B was 
having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Uncle Buck points out there was a lending gap of 4 months between  loans 3 and 4. 
Whilst I accept  this, I dont think it is grounds for Uncle Buck  to have fairly  concluded Mr 
Bs finances had stabilised. The short lending  gap of 10 days between loans 4 and 5, 
and the increase in loan value at this point, suggest this was not the case. At this point 
Uncle Buck ought  to have known  that Mr B was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Uncle Buck. Loan 6 was 
taken out nearly  19 months after Mr Bs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr B had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Uncle Buck  over an 
extended period.
I think  that Mr B lost out because  Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing  from loan 5 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging  Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Bs ability to 
access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im planning to uphold the complaint  about loans 1, 3, 5 and 6, and Uncle  Buck will have  to put 
things right. I would add that I agree with its assertion  that applicants  should  give accurate and 
complete information, but that doesnt alter its obligation to lend sustainably. And for the reasons set 
out above  I dont think it did so for every loan. Similarly its argument that Mr B applied again after 
making his complaint does not impact my assessment  of how Uncle Buck met its obligations.
putting things  right  what Uncle Buck will need to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr B paid on loans 1,3, 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove  any negative information about loans 1 and 3 from Mr Bs credit  file
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards  means any information recorded about 
them is adverse,  so all entries about  loans 5 and 6 should be removed from Mr Bs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN98280306my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im currently planning to partially uphold  Mr Bs complaint.  
If I do so, Uncle Buck Finance LLP should pay Mr B compensation as set out above.
