The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA lent irresponsibly when it approved 
his credit card and later increased the credit limit.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Mr M successfully applied for a credit card with PayPal in April 2016. In his application, Mr M 
said he was employed with an income of around £2,000 a month and was a tenant. PayPal 
says it considered outgoings like Mr Ms rent and regular living costs. In addition, PayPal 
carried out a credit search to look at Mr Ms other borrowing. The credit card application was 
approved with a credit limit of £1500.
PayPal increased the credit limit to £1,800 in November 2016, £2,300 in November 2017,
£2,800 in July 2018 and £3,800 in February 2019. PayPal says it carried out lending checks 
before each credit limit increase to ensure Mr M could afford to proceed.
Mr Ms card entered into arrears in the autumn of 2019 and was closed in December 2019. 
A default was reported on Mr Ms credit file.
Last year, Mr M complained that PayPal had lent irresponsibly and it issued a final 
response. PayPal didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly and didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint. 
Mr M referred his case to this service and it was considered by an investigator. They 
thought PayPal had dealt with Mr Ms complaint fairly so didnt ask it to take further action. 
Mr M asked to appeal, so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, PayPal was required to complete a reasonable and proportionate 
assessment of Mr Ms ability to sustainably repay the debt. This is often referred to as an 
affordability check and had to be borrower focused. That means PayPal needed to consider 
whether Mr M could sustainably afford the borrowing having taken his circumstances into 
account. The sorts of information PayPal needed to consider were:
-The amount of credit;
-The total figure repayable and size of regular payments;
-The duration of the agreement;
-The cost of the credit; and
-The borrowers individual circumstances.
That means theres no set list of checks a business has to consider. Whats considered 
proportionate may change based on various factors, including the above points. Ive looked 
at the different lending decisions PayPal has made since Mr M successfully applied for a 
credit card to see whether it completed proportionate checks to ensure it lent responsibly.
Mr M first applied in April 2016 and gave his income as between £2,000 and £2,500 a 
month after tax. PayPal used a rent figure of £500 per month along with living expenses of 
£500 a month. PayPal carried out a credit check but says it doesnt have a record of what it 
found. But Mr M has provided a copy of his credit file and I can see PayPal has submitted 
information that shows he owed around £18,000 in November 2016 (when it approved the 
first credit limit increase).
PayPal took Mr Ms income and outgoings and says Mr M was left with enough disposable 
income to maintain a credit card with a £1,500 credit limit. Ive considered the information 
PayPal had available and I think its decision to approve Mr Ms credit card application was 
reasonable. I havent found that PayPal lent irresponsibly when it approved the original 
application.
PayPal carried out a reasonably modest credit limit increase to £1,800 in November 2016. 
At this stage, I still think the decision to increase the credit limit was reasonable. PayPal has 
provided copies of its lending checks and there were no missed payments or other adverse 
credit reported. The increase was reasonably small and Mr M had maintained his credit card 
without issue. I havent been persuaded there were signs at this stage Mr M wasnt able to 
afford a further increase in the credit limit so Im unable to agree PayPal lent irresponsibly.
Ive reached a different view concerning the credit limit increase to £2,800 in November 
2017. PayPal has provided the affordability information it used. It found Mr Ms level of 
unsecured borrowing had increased from £18,000 in November 2016 to over £20,000 in 
November 2017. An increase of £2,000 in a year shouldve indicated Mr M may have 
become reliant on credit to make ends meet. In addition, the affordability information 
PayPal has provided shows that despite finding Mr M had £20,073 of unsecured credit it 
used a total minimum monthly payment figure of £100. That figure is unreasonably low 
when compared to the total outstanding balance Mr M had at the time.
Had PayPal used a more realistic figure, I think it wouldve found it was likely Mr M would 
struggle to make higher repayments and considered carrying out better, more 
comprehensive checks.
In much the same way, the credit limit increase in July 2018 found outstanding unsecured 
credit of £17,691 but used a figure of £0 for the minimum repayments required when 
assessing affordability. In February 2019 the affordability date found Mr M now owed
£26,239 (up nearly £10,000 from July 2018) but used a total repayments figure of £7 a 
month. In my view, the increasing level of Mr Ms unsecured debt shouldve highlighted 
the need to carry out more comprehensive checks to PayPal. And I also think the level of 
outgoings its used to assess the ongoing monthly payment was unrealistically low based 
on the evidence PayPal has supplied.
There is a range of options PayPal couldve taken to complete more comprehensive 
checks. PayPal couldve asked for bank statements to verify Mr Ms income and outgoings 
or evidence of his income for instance. Had PayPal carried out better checks, I think it 
wouldve found Mr M was struggling and had become reliant on credit. In my view, better 
checks wouldve led PayPal to decline credit limit increases from November 2017 onwards. 
I agree with Mr M that PayPal lent irresponsibly in this case. As a result, I intend to uphold 
Mr Ms complaint and direct PayPal to refund all interest, fees and charges applied from 
November 2017 to date.It wouldnt be fair for PayPal to record adverse information about a debt that was lent 
irresponsibly. As a result, I also intend to tell PayPal to remove any adverse information its
recorded on Mr Ms credit file from November 2017 onwards.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted 
me to consider. PayPal responded to confirm it had nothing further to add. Mr M responded 
and said he was confused that other complaints hes made about different businesses have 
been rejected despite this case being upheld. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M has queried why there are different outcomes in relation to complaints hes referred to 
us. We consider complaints on an individual basis. That means, we look at whether a 
business has treated its customer fairly in terms of the individual circumstances of that case. 
I want to assure Mr M that Ive considered the specific circumstances of his complaint about 
PayPal and agree it lent irresponsibly, as set out in my provisional decision. As neither party 
has provided new information for me to consider I see no reason to change the conclusions I 
reached. I still think Mr Ms complaint about PayPal should be upheld, for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cia SCA to 
settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to balances over £1,800 from
November 2017 to the date of settlement
- If the debt has been sold to a third party, PayPal should take steps to either retrieve it
or work with the new lender to put the agreed settlement in place
- Once the above refunds have been made, PayPal should contact Mr M to discuss
affordable repayment options
- Amend Mr Ms credit file to remove all adverse information recorded from November
2017 to date
- If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer being
an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments and
returned to Mr M along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from the date
they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to take off tax from this interest. PayPal must
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
