The complaint
This complaint is about the time its taken Family Assurance Friendly Society Limited  
trading as OneFamily  to transfer junior ISAs for Mr D and Miss D. The complaint is 
brought to us by the registered contact for the ISAs, who Im going to call Mr X.
What happened
In July 2020, OneFamily received some transfer requests for both ISAs from another ISA 
provider. But the requests named Mr X as the registered contact for the accounts, which at 
the time he wasnt. OneFamily wrote to the new ISA provider in mid-July, explaining that was 
a problem, and meant they couldnt go ahead with the transfer. 
The registered contact for the ISA then sent paperwork to OneFamily to pass their role to Mr 
X. OneFamily misplaced that paperwork for about a month, but eventually made Mr X the 
registered contact. But they said new transfer requests would be needed before they could 
complete the transfers for Mr D and Miss D.
The new ISA provider sent further transfer requests in October 2020. But these look to have 
left out the registered contacts details. OneFamily wrote back to them at the start of 
November to explain this meant the transfers wouldnt go ahead. 
The new ISA provider sent a third set of requests in early December. As in July, these 
included Mr Xs details as the registered contact. But this now matched with OneFamilys 
records. So the transfer went ahead, and by the end of December OneFamily wrote to the 
new ISA provider to confirm the funds for Mr D and Miss D had been transferred. 
There then appears to have been further delays setting up at least one of the new ISAs. 
Mr X complained on behalf of Mr D and Miss D. He couldnt believe how long a simple ISA 
transfer had taken. He felt OneFamily were to blame, as the process had been waiting for 
them to send the money over to the new ISA provider. 
OneFamily responded to the complaint, and explained what had happened. They agreed 
theyd caused a delay when they misplaced the transfer paperwork. But they said the 
problems had mainly been caused by the new ISA provider. 
The matter came to us. Our investigator considered the details of what had happened. He 
agreed with OneFamilys conclusions about the complaint. They werent responsible for not 
being able to act on the requests they received. And while there had been a delay changing 
the registered contact for the ISAs, that hadnt caused the more significant delays, which 
flowed from the requests not being quite right. 
Mr X told us he wasnt happy with that view. He pointed out the delay had been significant, 
and said he still felt OneFamily were responsible. 
The complaint therefore came to me for a formal review. I asked OneFamily to send me 
copies of the requests and responses that Ive referred to above. Theyve sent those, and I 
confirm they match up with the details the investigator considered when he formed his view. 
I also asked Mr X if hed ever raised a complaint with the new ISA provider about this matter, 
but he said he hadnt.
With that information, Ive been able to make a decision about this complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate why Mr X is upset with the service hes received. ISA transfers should 
happen much quicker than has been achieved here. But the question for me is whether its 
fair to hold OneFamily responsible for those delays. Ive decided its not, so Im not going to 
uphold Mr Xs complaint against them. 
The issue seems to be that the requests being sent to OneFamily werent right. OneFamily 
werent making those requests, so theyre not responsible for the errors they contained. 
Theyve done enough to provider a reasonable service by explaining to the company making 
the requests what the problems were, and then leaving it for them to fix those. 
When a suitable request was received, OneFamily completed the transfer within a couple of 
weeks. Thats in line with the level of service Id expect to see. 
I do accept that OneFamily should have acted sooner on the paperwork to change the 
registered contact. But I also agree with them that the delay was minor when compared to 
the problems created by the errors in the ISA transfer requests. 
So while Mr X is entitled to be critical of the time the transfers have taken, based on the 
evidence Ive seen I dont think its right to aim that criticism at OneFamily. 
My final decision
Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D and Miss D 
to accept or reject my decision before 14 September 2021.
