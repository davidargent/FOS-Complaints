K820x#14complaint
Ms C complains about charges applied by National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) to her 
current account. 
background
Ms C opened a packaged bank account with NatWest in July 2011.  She then closed the 
account in April 2015. In June 2018  she complained to NatWest about  all the charges it had 
applied to her account. She says these charges amounted to nearly £1,000. She says she 
was in severe financial difficulty and the charges had made  her situation worse. 
Ms C also raised a complaint about the sale of the packaged bank account and the monthly  
fees that were  charged. That has been  dealt with under a separate  complaint reference so 
doesnt form part of this decision.
NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said the charges had all been  applied 
correctly and in line with the terms and conditions of the account. It said as some of the 
charges had been applied  more than six years  ago it didnt consent to our service looking 
into those. Ms C agreed that our adjudicator would only look at charges applied  from 
June 2012 onwards. 
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint be upheld.  She said the charges  had been  
applied because Ms C had gone into an unarranged overdraft. She thought  the charges had 
all been applied correctly  to the account.  She said Ms C only told NatWest she was in 
financial difficulty at the time she closed her account. But she thought NatWest had acted 
fairly at the time by refunding some charges.
Ms C didnt agree. In summary she said she had been in severe financial hardship since  
early 2000.  NatWest had declined  her application  for an overdraft, had it approved  a limit of 
even £100 it would have prevented her incurring the majority of the charges. 
The complaint has been passed  to me for a final decision.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked through Ms Cs account statements. These show that from June 2012 (excluding  
her package bank  account fees) £516  of charges were applied  to her account. These 
charges were applied  because  Ms C either  went overdrawn  (she didnt have  an agreed 
overdraft limit) or had insufficient funds  in the account to cover  payments due to go out. 
From what  I can see these charges  were  applied correctly based  on how Ms C was 
managing her account. The charges  and when they could be applied were  set out in the 
terms and conditions of her account which  Ms C agreed to when she opened  her account. 
But that isnt the only thing for me to consider. 
Ms C says she was in financial difficulty throughout the whole time she held the account. 
NatWest has a responsibility to treat customers in financial difficulty  fairly. So Ive gone on to 
Ref: DRN43231422think about whether  NatWest knew, or ought to have known that Ms C was struggling. And 
whether I think it did enough to help. 
NatWests contact notes  show that Ms C did tell them about her financial difficulty when she 
closed her account in April 2015.  Just because someone is in financial difficulty,  it doesnt  
mean NatWest has to refund charges, although I would expect it to think about  whether this 
would help. There could  be a number of other options they could explore in order to fairly 
help someone  who was struggling. But I can see that NatWest did agree to refund £61.16 in 
charges at the time in order  to bring  Ms Cs account  balance back to zero.  I think this was a 
fair thing  to do as it allowed her to close the account  immediately  with nothing further to pay. 
I cant see that Ms C made  NatWest aware  of her financial difficulty  at any other time before 
this. But from the account statements its clear NatWest has refunded charges in the past in 
order to help her. I cant be sure why these refunds were offered, but since June 2012 
NatWest has refunded £247.16 to the account.  This is almost half of all the charges Ms C 
incurred during that time. So even if Ms C did tell NatWest previously about  her financial 
difficulty, it seems NatWest did take reasonable steps to help her. 
Ive thought about whether NatWest  ought to have  known (without Ms C telling them) that 
she was in financial difficulty. Having looked at the way Ms C managed  her account,  I dont 
think there were any clear signs she was in severe hardship or financial difficulty. So I dont 
think NatWest should  have realised something was wrong or done  anything differently. 
I say this because  Ms C was rarely more than £30 overdrawn. And when  she was overdrawn 
she was able to bring  the account back into credit  quickly. I can see she also had a regular 
and consistent  income  coming into the account. And all household bills were  also regularly 
paid on time without difficulty. So I think all the signs indicated that Ms C was managing her 
finances reasonably well. Although she would occasionally  go overdrawn by a small amount, 
I dont think that in isolation should have  been enough to alert NatWest  to a wider problem 
with Ms Cs financial situation. So for these reasons, I dont think NatWest has done  
anything wrong. 
Lastly, Ms C says she was refused an overdraft by NatWest and if her application had been 
approved she would have incurred fewer  charges. NatWest  says it has no records of Ms C 
ever applying for an overdraft. Ms C hasnt been  able to say when or how her application 
was made.  Overall Im not persuaded she did apply for an overdraft.  But even if she had 
applied, she wouldnt have been guaranteed to receive one.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
