The complaint
Mr M complains that HSBC UK Bank plc wont refund to him the money that hes claimed for 
a car that wasnt of satisfactory quality.
 
What happened
Mr M paid £28,692 for a nearly new car in July 2019, £500 of which was paid using his 
HSBC credit card. There were some issues with the car which were dealt with by the dealer 
but Mr M says that there continued to be issues with the car. The car was returned to the 
dealer in December 2019 and Mr M said that he wanted to reject the car. The dealer didnt 
accept his rejection of the car and said that the current faults were caused by a dash-cam 
that had been fitted to it.
Mr M then made a claim to HSBC under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It 
wrote to him in January 2020 and asked him to provide more information about his claim. It 
also asked him to provide an independent report about the issues with the car. The letter 
said that: a full investigation for a section 75 claim can take 8-12 weeks to conclude. 
Mr M complained to HSBC in June 2020 that it hadnt issued a determination on his claim 
and about the delay. He said that he would be selling the car at a significant financial loss 
and that he was unable to procure an engineers report for the faults with the car. It accepted 
that it shouldn't have incorrectly set his expectations by providing timescales it couldn't 
guarantee and it credited his account with £150 to apologise for that.
Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She couldnt say that requesting an 
independent report to conclude if there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
was unfair or unreasonable or that HSBC had acted unfairly or unreasonably by rejecting his 
claim based on the evidence provided to it. She thought that its offer to pay him £150 was 
fair and reasonable and in line with what she wouldve offered had no compensation been 
offered.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary 
and amongst other things, that:
hes provided HSBC with full updates and exhibits about the issues with the car;
an inspection of the car at his cost wouldnt progress the matter of liability and until 
HSBC accepted liability a report was not critical to the matter;
HSBC provided detailed requirements of the engineers report in an e-mail in 
September 2020 and previous references to such a report did not set out those 
detailed requirements;
HSBC had completed its investigations by September 2020, subject to the content of 
an engineers report, which could have been concluded some time previously if it had 
acted on his e-mail of January 2020 in a timely manner;
the costs of the dash-cam were met by the manufacturer under warranty and the 
dealer would have to prove that the fault was caused by the dash-cam installation; 
and
faults of a similar nature to the issues that the car has suffered were present in other 
cars of this model and hes provided evidence of that from websites. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about HSBC, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the dealer and that HSBCs 
response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
in these circumstances the breach of contract about which Mr M is claiming is that 
the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was sold to him - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was sold to Mr M in July 2019 was a nearly new car that had been driven 
for 500 miles and had a price of £28,692;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that there were some issues with the car within 
the first six months, that it was returned to the dealer for repairs or that a dash-cam 
was installed on the car;
Mr M told the dealer that he wanted to reject the car in December 2019 but the dealer 
didnt accept his rejection of it and said that the current faults were caused by a dash-
cam that had been fitted to it;
Mr M made a claim to HSBC under section 75 in December 2019 and provided it with 
detailed information in support of his claim  it replied in January 2020 and asked him 
to provide more information about his claim and an independent report about the 
issues with the car (and it set out its requirements for such a report);
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for HSBC to ask Mr M to provide it with an 
independent report about the issues with the car so that it could use that report to 
determine whether or not the car was of satisfactory quality when it was sold to Mr M 
and whether or not there had been a breach of contract by the dealer;
Mr M hasnt provided such a report and has now sold the car but HSBC says that it 
requires an independent report  Im not persuaded that Mr M has provided enough 
evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was sold to him or 
that HSBC was required to accept liability for the issues with the car or issue a 
determination on Mr Ms claim without an independent report being provided;HSBC accepts that it provided incorrect information to Mr M in January 2020 about 
the timescale for dealing with his claim and it credited his account with £150 to 
apologise for providing timescales that it couldn't guarantee  I consider that to be 
fair and reasonable compensation for the distress and inconvenience that Mr M has 
been caused by that incorrect information and Im not persuaded that a higher 
amount of compensation is justified;
I sympathise with Mr M for the difficulties that hes described and for the issues that 
hes had with the car, but (other than as described in the sub-paragraph above) Im 
not persuaded that HSBC has responded to Mr Ms claim unfairly or unreasonably; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
HSBC to refund to Mr M any of the money that he paid for the car, to pay him any 
further compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 April 2021.
