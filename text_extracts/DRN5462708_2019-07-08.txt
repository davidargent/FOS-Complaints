K820x#14complaint
Mr R says CashEuroNet UK LLC irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 15 payday  loans  CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) and 
three instalment loans  CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Pounds  to Pocket) provided to Mr R 
between October 2012 and June 2018.  Mr R switched between the two lenders  in this time. 
The payday  loans ranged in amount between £50 and £700 and were to be repaid in two 
instalments, apart from the last loan. The instalment loans ranged  between £650 and £800 
and were to be repaid  in 12 monthly instalments. 
There was a break of almost three  years  between the repayment of loan 14 and loan 15 
being taken out. I think  this is significant and so loan 15 can be regarded as a new chain of 
borrowing. CashEuroNet UK LLC offered redress  for loans five and nine.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint in part and also thought the loans from loan 7 to 14 
and loan 18 shouldnt  have been given. CashEuroNet UK LLC disagreed  and the complaint 
was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried  out proportionate  checks to 
make sure Mr R could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  UK LLC should  fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN54627082I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  UK LLC was required  to 
establish whether  Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC has already agreed to make  the redress  Id require for loan five. So I 
wont consider this loan further. CashEuroNet UK LLC asked Mr R for information  about his 
income and expenditure and it carried out credit checks. Given the loan amounts, what  was 
apparent about  Mr Rs circumstances at the time and his history with CashEuroNet UK LLC, 
I think these checks were  sufficient and proportionate for loans one, two and 15. So I cant  
say it was wrong for CashEuroNet UK LLC to approve these three loans.
I think further checks should have been made  for loans three, four, six, 16 and 17. But I dont 
have enough information from Mr R to show what better checks would have found. So I cant  
safely say that it was wrong  for CashEuroNet UK LLC to approve  these  loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CashEuroNet UK LLCs lending history with Mr R, 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet UK LLC should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loans seven. I say this because:
From  loan seven to loan 14 Mr R was provided  with a new loan within  a short  time of 
settling a previous  one. So CashEuroNet  UK LLC ought to have  realised it was more 
likely than not Mr R was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
So I think the pattern  of Mr Rs borrowing showed that he was persistently dependent on 
short-term borrowing. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed CashEuroNet UK LLC.  
Loan 14 was taken out two years after Mr Rs first. And, with the top up, it was for a 
larger amount. Mr R had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
CashEuroNet UK LLC over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN54627083I think that Mr R lost out because CashEuroNet UK LLC continued to provide borrowing from 
loan seven onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Rs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-
cost loans.
So I think the pattern  of lending here shows that the loans were  unsustainable. Therefore, 
Im upholding the complaint about loans  seven to 14 and CashEuroNet  UK LLC should  put 
things right.
I also think it was wrong  for CashEuroNet  UK LLC to approve loan 18. This is because the 
refinanced loan repayment required a significant  amount of Mr Rs income.  There  was a 
significant risk that he wouldnt  be able to meet his existing commitments without borrowing 
again. So I think its unlikely that Mr R would be able to sustainably  meet  his repayment for 
this loan. 
putting things right  what CashEuroNet UK LLC needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans five, seven to 14 (from June 2103 to 
November 2014) and 18 (in June 2018); 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about five and 18 from Mr Rs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from seven  means  any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans seven to 14 should be removed from Mr Rs credit 
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet UK LLC to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  give Mr R a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Rs 
complaint. I require CashEuroNet UK LLC to pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2019.
