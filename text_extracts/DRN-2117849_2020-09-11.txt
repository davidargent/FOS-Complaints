The complaint
Miss C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave her incorrect 
information about the amount she was allowed to deposit into her Help to Buy ISA.
What happened
In early 2018, Miss C opened a Help to Buy ISA with NatWest. This is a government 
scheme, set up to help first time home buyers. It allowed the account holder to deposit up to 
£1,200 in the first month of opening the ISA, followed by a monthly limit of £200.
 
In August 2019, Miss C attempted to deposit £1,000 into her ISA. She says NatWest told her 
she was allowed to do this because she hadnt used the full £1,200 allowance in the first 
month. But NatWest returned £800 of the deposit to her current account. 
NatWest apologised for giving Miss C the wrong information and offered her £30 to 
compensate her for it. It said it wasnt able to tell her if withdrawing funds from her Help to 
Buy ISA would affect her government bonus as its not a banking product, its a government 
scheme. 
Miss C brought her complaint to our service. She said this had changed her long term 
savings plans for buying a house and it would take her significantly longer to save the 
amount in the account. She wanted NatWest to allow her to transfer the extra funds into the 
ISA. Miss C was also unhappy that NatWest wouldnt confirm if she was eligible for the 
government bonus.
Our investigator looked into Miss Cs concerns but didnt think her complaint should be 
upheld. He didnt think she had lost out financially because of NatWests incorrect advice. 
And he felt the £30 it had offered her was reasonable.
 
Miss C said she would like her complaint to be progressed to an ombudsman. She felt 
NatWest should have let her know if she was eligible for the government bonus because it 
had chosen to offer Help to Buy ISAs. She didnt think £30 was sufficient compensation for 
the distress, inconvenience and frustration shed experienced.
So, Miss Cs complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached broadly the same conclusions as our investigator, Ill explain 
why.
When she first brought her complaint to us, Miss C said she wanted NatWest to transfer the 
extra £800 to her ISA. Following our investigators view, Miss C has told us she understands 
why this isnt possible.
NatWest has acknowledged Miss C was given the wrong information about how much she 
could deposit into the ISA. I appreciate it was disappointing for her to learn that this was 
incorrect, and it would take her longer to reach her savings goals than shed been led to 
believe. But I dont think this misinformation would have had any financial impact on her, 
because the money was returned to her current account shortly after shed attempted the 
deposit into her ISA.
As the provider of the ISA, NatWest is responsible for running the account while its open. 
But responsibility for receiving, reviewing and processing applications for ISA bonus 
payments belongs to the scheme administrator. So, I can understand why NatWest was 
reluctant to give Miss C advice about how her bonus might be affected. But NatWest could 
possibly have been more helpful, by directing her to where she could find the information 
she was looking for.
While I understand that Miss C feels frustrated by the customer service shes received from 
NatWest, I feel that the £30 its offered her is fair compensation for this. So, I wont ask 
NatWest to do anything more. 
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay Miss C £30 to settle the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So, my decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Miss C £30.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 October 2020.
