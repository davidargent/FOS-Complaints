K821x#15complaint
Miss B complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc incorrectly applied  a default to her 
account. Miss B also complains that despite  promising  to remove the default from her credit 
file NatWest has failed  to do so. 
background
Miss B originally opened  a student  account  with NatWest that came with an overdraft. 
NatWest has said Miss Bs account  had been passed to its collections teams at various 
periods since 2013  and was being  handled by it when she called in February 2018. 
Miss B called NatWest  on 1 February 2018 and said she wasnt working  and asked for some  
help. NatWest agreed to put a hold on its collections activity,  not to send the account  to its 
recoveries team and not to apply a default for 30 days. But NatWest failed to put the agreed 
actions in place.  
On 3 March 2018 Miss B wasnt able to use her account and called NatWest. It came  to light 
that her overdraft account had been  defaulted despite what NatWest had said. Miss B 
complained and NatWest  agreed to remove the default from her credit  file and paid £115 
compensation. 
No further payments were made towards the overdraft  until August 2018 when Miss B 
contacted NatWest to discuss a payment  plan.  But Miss B went  on to complain that the 
default still hadnt been removed from her credit file. NatWest responded and agreed the 
default shouldve  been removed from Miss Bs credit  file and said it would take steps  to do 
that. NatWest also paid Miss B £100 for its error. 
Miss B referred her complaint to this service  and an investigator looked at what had 
happened. During their investigation  NatWest  explained  that it still hadnt  removed  the 
default from Miss Bs credit file because she had only made one payment towards the 
outstanding debt between March 2018 and September  2018.  NatWest said that the account 
wouldve fallen into default  shortly after February  2018 because no payments  were being 
made. 
The investigator thought NatWests explanation was reasonable but recommended it 
increase the settlement by another  £85 taking the total award to £300. NatWest  agreed and 
said it would  delete  the default  if Miss B was willing to set up a payment arrangement. 
Miss B didnt feel this was a fair way to resolve the complaint and said she hadnt made any 
payments towards  the overdraft because shed  been told not to by NatWest in March 2018. 
The investigator obtained call recordings  but didnt change his view of the complaint  
because he didnt find Miss B was told she couldnt make payments to the overdraft. Miss B 
asked for her complaint to be appealed so its been passed to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to start by saying  that I agree NatWest has made several  mistakes  in this case. It told 
Miss B her account would be put on hold and wouldnt be subject  to a default and then failed 
Ref: DRN99453752to act as promised. It also told Miss B that the default would be deleted  from her credit file 
when that wasnt  right either. The situations been  going on for a long time and I can 
understand why Miss B is frustrated and upset. 
But I need to be fair to both sides. And whilst I agree NatWest has provided  poor service  and 
made mistakes, Ive focused on whether its errors put Miss B into a worse  position. Having 
carefully considered  everything provided by Miss B and NatWest, Im not persuaded that it 
has. Ill explain why. 
Miss Bs account was handled by NatWests  collections team for a reasonable amount of 
2017 which is why she asked for a hold to be put on any further  action in February  2018.  
NatWest agreed but I can see from its contact  notes and the call recordings that it advised 
the hold could only be put in place for a 30 day period and collections activity  would  start 
again in March 2018. If NatWest had correctly followed that process  I think  its likely Miss Bs 
account wouldve  defaulted a short time later.  
Miss B told the investigator that NatWest said she couldnt make any payments towards  the 
debt when she discussed her account with it in March 2018.  Ive listened to all the calls 
Miss B had with NatWest in February  and March 2018 and I didnt hear that. On 
3 March 2018 NatWest advised Miss B she could start making payments into her account at 
a local branch immediately. NatWest  also said Miss B would be able to contact the 
collections team and set up a payment  arrangement two weeks  after she called. Im sorry to 
disappoint Miss B but I havent found that she was told not to make  any repayments to her 
account. 
NatWest said it will remove the default if Miss B sets up a payment arrangement and makes 
payments to repay  the outstanding debt and I think thats a reasonable offer. There will still 
be an impact on Miss Bs credit file under this scenario but it would remove  the default. 
Miss B told the investigator that she feels NatWest is pressuring her into agreeing a payment  
arrangement but I dont  think  thats  the case. Ultimately, if Miss B had agreed a payment 
plan to bring her balance  down over time it wouldve still shown on her credit file. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Miss B but whilst  I agree there were several mistakes by NatWest  
here, I havent found grounds to tell it to delete the default from her credit file. I think 
NatWests offer to discuss a payment arrangement  with Miss B and if successful delete the 
default from her credit  file is reasonable. Miss B asked the investigator why all the 
compensation had been  added together but thats  because we look at everything that 
happened. And in this case,  NatWest has agreed to pay Miss B a further £85 for incorrectly 
telling her the default would be deleted,  taking  the total settlement to £300. 
Ive carefully considered  everything Miss B and NatWest have said and provided  in reaching 
my decision.  Having done so, Im satisfied NatWests offer to remove  the default from 
Miss Bs credit file if a payment arrangement can be agreed and maintained  is reasonable. 
In addition, I think the total award  of £300 is fair in all the circumstances.  As I think  NatWest 
has agreed a fair settlement in this case Im not telling it to take any further  action. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Miss B £300 (less any payments already paid) and arrange to discuss  a payment 
arrangement as set out above.  Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im 
required to ask Miss B to accept or reject my decision before 6 April 2019.
