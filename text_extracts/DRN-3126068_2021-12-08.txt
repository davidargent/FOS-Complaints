The complaint
Mr U complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his accounts without 
notice and didnt give reason to explain why it took this action. 
What happened
In March 2020, NatWest reviewed Mr Us accounts that he held with it, and placed 
restrictions on them as a result. A little time later, in early April 2020, NatWest wrote to Mr U 
to inform him it was closing his accounts within seven days. 
Unhappy about this Mr U complained to NatWest. In its response, NatWest said it had not 
made the wrong decision in closing Mr Us accounts. Mr U referred his complaint to this 
service. 
One of our investigators looked into the matter. In summary they found: 
- As a regulated bank, NatWest has regulatory obligations it must adhere to. In doing 
so, it can review and, in some cases, decide to end customer relationships 
- NatWest arent obligated to disclose its reasons for closing Mr Us accounts, and it 
has applied the terms of the account fairly 
- NatWest have returned all remaining funds to Mr U 
Mr U said he wasnt given seven days notice of his accounts being closed and he wasnt 
made aware of any review NatWest was carrying out. 
Our investigator said: 
- they were satisfied from the information theyd seen that the current account was still 
active in March 2020 and records show the account was closed in April 2020
- NatWest was under no obligation to inform Mr U it was reviewing his accounts   
- They were satisfied NatWest did send a notice to close letter 
As Mr U remained unhappy, the complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Us complaint. I know this will disappoint 
Mr U, so Ill explain why. 
Account closure 
The investigator was right to point out NatWest has important legal and regulatory
obligations it must meet when providing accounts to customers. These obligations are
ongoing, so do not only pertain to when an account is opened.
To comply with its obligations, NatWest may need to review an account and/or restrict its
customers access. If NatWest didnt comply with its obligations it could risk serious
sanction. NatWest are under no obligation Im aware of that it must tell its customer when it 
is carrying out such reviews  and its reasons for closing an account. 
Sometimes a financial business may have good reason not to do this. Having considered 
what NatWest did, and why, I dont think its done anything wrong by not explaining why it 
closed Mr Us account and that they were under review.  
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account. 
Ive seen NatWests terms and conditions and note if it chooses to close an account it will 
normally do so by giving sixty days notice. But in some circumstances, it can do so much 
sooner - and even immediately. 
Having looked at the reasons NatWest reviewed Mr Us accounts  something Im not 
obligated to disclose  I think it had good basis to do so. Its quite possible had NatWest 
asked Mr U questions about his account conduct, it may have taken a different course of 
action. It could have meant Mr U was given sixty days notice of closure instead of seven 
days. 
But I dont think this would have made much difference. I say that because Ive seen 
information which shows Mr U had accounts with other banks. So, I think its likely his 
NatWest accounts being closed had little or no impact on his ability to use banking services. 
I also note that Mr U had taken most of his money out of his NatWest account before it was 
closed  and any residual amount, which was later returned, was nominal.
Notice to close the account  
Mr U says he wasnt sent any notification about the accounts being closed. But hes also 
said he received a letter in early April stating his accounts had been closed without reason. 
NatWest have sent me a template of the letter that it says was sent to Mr U. This letter 
explains NatWest has decided to no longer provide banking facilities, that it can close 
accounts down immediately in some circumstances and, its customer has seven days to 
settle any outstanding balances. 
Mr U has said this matter meant him using his other accounts to settle NatWest ones  
including his credit card and this put him under a lot of pressure. On one hand Mr U says he 
wasnt given any notice, but hes also said he acted on information that his accounts were 
being closed. So, given the template Ive seen, and what Mr U has said, Im persuaded 
NatWest did send him a letter that it was closing his accounts - and that he had seven days 
to pay any outstanding balances.   
Mr U says this matter has caused him trouble and upset. I do appreciate this matter wouldve 
caused him some difficulty. But having looked at whats happened in this particular case, I 
can see no basis on which I might make an award against NatWest given I think it had 
genuine cause to review Mr Us accounts, and closing them had little detriment to Mr U. So Im not going to ask NatWest to compensate Mr U for any trouble and upset this may 
have caused.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2022.
