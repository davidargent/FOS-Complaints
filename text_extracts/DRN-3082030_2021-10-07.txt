The complaint
Mr R complains about the amount that hes been charged by Lex Autolease Limited for 
damage to a car that he returned at the end of his hire agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr R under a hire agreement with Lex Autolease that he signed in 
April 2018. He returned the car when the agreement ended and it was inspected by a third 
party on behalf of Lex Autolease. The inspection identified damage to the car and Mr R was 
charged £1,522.34 for that damage. He complained to Lex Autolease about the charges but 
it said that the invoiced charges were valid. Mr R wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Lex Autolease had applied the charges unfairly as they had been applied in line with the 
terms and conditions of the agreement. 
Mr R has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded to 
our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in summary, that:
theres no damage to the wing mirror, wheel and drivers door;
the scratches on the boot lid and rear bumper are less than 25mm so are fair wear 
and tear;
the charge for the boot area isnt justified;
Lex Autolease didnt properly review his complaint about the charges; and 
he believes that Lex Autolease, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association 
and the third party that inspected the car are working together to exaggerate 
damage, their process is flawed and the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing 
Association doesnt seem to be fit for purpose.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr R signed the hire agreement which said: If the Vehicle when returned is not in 
good order, repair and condition for its age and mileage assessed in accordance with 
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association  guidelines  you must also 
pay us the actual or if we choose, the estimated cost of the work required to put the 
Vehicle in such condition;
Mr R returned the car when the agreement ended and it was inspected by a third 
party on behalf of Lex Autolease in April 2021  photos and a video of the car were 
taken and a vehicle condition report was prepared;
the report recorded the cars mileage as 26,585 and described 14 areas of damage 
to the car;
Lex Autolease charged Mr R £1,522.34 (which included a waiver of £100) for eleven 
areas of damage which were listed on the invoice;
Ive reviewed the photos and video of the car which show the condition in which it 
was returned by Mr R and I dont consider that the car was returned in good order, 
repair and condition;
I consider that there was substantial damage to the car including to the front and rear 
bumpers, two doors, a wing mirror, the boot lid, two quarter panels, a wheel and a 
wing and that the interior of the car was excessively soiled;
I consider that the damage was more than would reasonably be considered to be fair 
wear and tear whether assessed in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and 
Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear or more generally;
I consider that theres clear damage to the wing mirror, a wheel, and the drivers door 
and there are multiple scratches on the boot lid and bumper;
Mr R says that the charge for the boot area isnt justified  but theres no separate 
charge for damage to the boot area  he has been charged £51 because the interior 
was excessively soiled and its clear from the photos and video that the interior of the 
car, including the boot area, was not in an acceptable condition when the car was 
returned;
I consider that Lex Autolease has charged Mr R for damage to the car in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of his hire agreement and Im not persuaded that Lex 
Autolease was required to do more than it did in response to Mr Rs complaint about 
the charges;
Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to show that Lex Autolease, the British 
Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and the third party that inspected the car are 
working together to exaggerate damage or that the process is flawed;
Mr Rs complaint is about Lex Autolease and not British Vehicle Rental and Leasing 
Association which is a trade association whose guidelines are widely used in the 
rental and leasing car industry - so I havent made any comments on his views about 
it; and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Lex Autolease has 
acted incorrectly in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to reduce (or waive) the amount that its charged Mr R 
for damage to the car that he returned, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
