* Uncle Buck  Finance has given us 2 different closure dates for loan 12  but from the evidence Ive 
seen I am satisfied that this loan has been closed.
Our adjudicator felt that loans  1 to 3 shouldnt be upheld. Mr G appears to have accepted 
our adjudicators findings about these loans,  so as these loans are no longer in dispute I 
wont be considering  these further.  But I have  thought about  these  loans in the context of the 
overall lending  relationship. 
Our adjudicator felt loans 4 onwards shouldnt have been given. Uncle  Buck Finance 
disagreed, and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  Finance needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried  out proportionate  checks to 
make sure Mr G could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
Ref: DRN22491812of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck Finance should  fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  Finance was required to 
establish whether  Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Uncle Buck Finances lending history  with Mr G, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck Finance should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so Uncle Buck  
Finance should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 4. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck Finance ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to 
repay his loans sustainably. Mr G had taken out three loans within six months,  and 
new lending was typically given within  weeks or so of the last being repaid. Uncle 
Buck Finance  says that there were some  gaps in the lending  chain  and some  periods 
where Mr G did not have any outstanding borrowing with it. However,  these gaps 
were generally quite short. Looking at the overall borrowing chain it appears Mr G 
was in a cycle of repeat lending without  any significant gaps to suggest  he was 
Ref: DRN22491813managing his finances well for any period. So, Uncle  Buck Finance ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Gs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Uncle Buck  Finance.  
Even though Mr G had paid off his first three  loans early, he had taken  out additional 
borrowing shortly after the last loan was repaid. And the amount he was borrowing 
wasnt significantly reducing over time.  In fact Mr Gs final loan was his largest to 
date, taken out nearly 2.5 years after the first. So, Mr G paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Uncle Buck Finance over an extended period. 
I think that Mr G lost out because Uncle Buck Finance continued  to provide borrowing from 
loan 4 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 - 12 and Uncle Buck  Finance  should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck Finance needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 - 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 4 to 12 should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck Finance to take off tax from this interest. 
Uncle Buck  Finance must  give Mr G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Gs complaint.  Uncle Buck  Finance  should 
pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
