Complaint
Mr K has complained that Santander UK Plc (Santander) irresponsibly provided him with 
an overdraft which it increased the limit on when he was already in financial difficulty.
Background
One of our adjudicators looked at Mr Ks complaint and thought Santander should have 
realised Mr Ks overdraft had already become unsustainable by January 2014. So it needed 
to refund all the interest, fees and charges it added to Mr Ks overdraft from this point. 
Santander disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Santander will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when 
applying overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this 
decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I think Santander acted unfairly when it 
continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from January 2014. By this point, 
it was evident Mr K was struggling financially. 
A cursory look at Mr Ks statements during this period show that hed been struggling to 
manage his finances. Santander has said Mr K stayed within his overdraft limit and so it had 
no reason for concern. But this was only happening as Mr K kept borrowing from a number 
of payday lenders to avoid going over his limit. 
The sheer number of payday and other high-cost lenders Mr K was making payments to, is 
arguably, in itself clear evidence of his difficulties. But along with these payments its also 
clear to see that Mr K was gambling significant sums. This meant his ability to repay his 
overdraft was largely dependent on his success as a gambler. And I dont think it was 
reasonable for Santander to believe that Mr K was in a position to repay what he owed 
without borrowing further or experiencing difficulty.    
So I think that by January 2014 Santander should have stopped providing the overdraft on 
the same terms and treated Mr K with forbearance rather than adding even more interest, 
fees and charges on the overdraft.
All of this means that Santander should have realised that Mr K was experiencing financial 
difficulty and offered him help to repay what he owed. As Santander didnt react to Mr Ks 
account usage and what he said, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably. 
In reaching my conclusions, Ive thought about what Santander has said about the 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook, the terms and conditions of Mr Ks account, its process and 
any actions it may have taken. But for the reasons Ive already explained, I remain satisfied 
that it wasnt fair to continue adding charges to Mr Ks account from January 2014.
Mr K ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges at a time when he was already 
experiencing difficulty. So Im satisfied that Mr K lost out because of what Santander did 
wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what Santander needs to do to put things right for Mr K
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Ks complaint for Santander to put things right by:
Reworking Mr Ks current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from January 2014 onwards are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made Santander should contact Mr K to arrange a suitable repayment plan, 
Mr K is encouraged to get in contact with and cooperate with Santander to reach 
a suitable agreement for this. If it considers it appropriate to record negative 
information on Mr Ks credit file, it should reflect what would have been recorded 
had it started the process of taking corrective action on the overdraft in January 
2014. Santander can also reduce Mr Ks overdraft limit by the amount of refund if 
it considers it appropriate to do so, as long as doing so wouldnt leave him over 
his limit.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mr K along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
Santander should remove any adverse information from Mr Ks credit file. 
Santander can also reduce Mr Ks overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it 
considers it appropriate to do so.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Santander to take off tax from this interest. Santander 
must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.

My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ks complaint. Santander UK Plc should put 
things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2022.
