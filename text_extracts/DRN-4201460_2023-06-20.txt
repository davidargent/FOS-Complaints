DRN-4201460
The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain U K Insurance Limited (UKI) declined a claim they made under a 
buildings insurance policy for accidental damage to toilet bowls.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known by both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy does cover damage which happens accidentally however, there is an 
exclusion relating to any damage caused by cleaning. 
I appreciate the enamel on the toilet was scratched by a wire brush which isnt 
usually used as part of the normal cleaning routine and, the damage wasnt done 
purposefully. 
However, the damage was caused during the process of cleaning the toilets and 
therefore I cant say UKI has acted unreasonably or unfairly declining the claim 
based on the terms and conditions of the policy. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Ps complaint against U K Insurance 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 July 2023.
