Mr B says Uncle Buck Finance LLP irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about six payday loans  Uncle Buck  provided to Mr B between  June  2015  
and June 2016. Mr Bs borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 01/06/2015 30/06/2015 1 £200.00 £248.00
2 30/06/2015 30/09/2015 3 £500.00 £253.00
3 30/09/2015 31/12/2015 3 £585.00 £297.00
4 31/12/2015 31/03/2016 3 £600.00 £303.00
5 31/03/2016 30/06/2016 3 £600.00 £303.00
6 30/06/2016 01/08/2018 3 £600.00 £304.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Bs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Uncle Buck disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN64733872There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Our adjudicator thought Uncle Buck had carried out proportionate checks for loans 1 to 3.  
Mr B didnt respond to the view. As there  is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about 
these loans, I wont be making any findings  on these  loans. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 4 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr B was in a cycle of debt and was further  borrowing  to cover the hole that repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances.  This was Mr Bs fourth  loan in almost seven 
months and Mr B had been in debt with Uncle Buck  the entire time. Each time Mr B repaid a 
loan he needed  to borrow again  the same day and the amounts were increasing. Loan 4 was 
for three times the amount he originally borrowed.  It was likely this behaviour of 
indebtedness was becoming increasing more difficult to sustain. This was shown when Mr B 
fell into arrears almost immediately after he took out the sixth loan. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Mr B, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And Uncle  Buck should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 5. I say 
this because at this point Mr B wasnt making  any real inroads to the amount  he owed Uncle  
Buck. Loan  6 was taken out 13 months  after Mr Bs first loan.  And there wasnt a single day 
during this time that Mr B wasnt  indebted  to Uncle Buck. Mr B had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to Uncle Buck over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Bs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN64733873So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4, 5 and 6 and Uncle  Buck should put 
things right as set out below.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 4, 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 from Mr Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 and 6 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Uncle Buck  Finance 
LLP should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
