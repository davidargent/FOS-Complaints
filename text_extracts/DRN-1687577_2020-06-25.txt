The complaint
Mr G complains about the interest Capital One (Europe) plc has applied to his credit card. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
When Mr G accepted the credit agreement for his Capital One credit card he agreed 
that interest would be applied to the outstanding balance. I havent found anything to 
show that Capital One has incorrectly applied interest to Mr Gs credit card balance. 
If consumers are in financial difficulty businesses should treat them positively and 
sympathetically. But that doesnt mean they have to freeze interest. Before Capital 
One agrees to reduce or freeze interest it would need to assess Mr Gs 
circumstances to see what affordable payment options can be offered. Without first 
checking Mr Gs circumstances, I wouldn't expect Capital One to freeze interest or 
put his account on hold. 
There is no record to show Mr G contacted Capital One in August 2019 or that it 
agreed to suspend interest and charges. Capital One says it doesnt offer an option 
to freeze interest unless it has checked the borrowers finances. Im not persuaded 
Capital One agreed to freeze interest or put Mr Gs credit card on hold. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr G but Im satisfied Capital One has dealt with his complaint 
fairly so Im not telling it to take any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
