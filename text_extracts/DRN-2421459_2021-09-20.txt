The complaint
Ms P is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA set up direct debits without her 
authorisation. They also chased her for a debt, when they could have taken funds directly 
from her current account and didnt allow her to clear it with her debit card.  
What happened
Ms P complains that PayPal have been setting up direct debits without her consent on a 
regular basis during 2019 and 2020. Specifically she refers to three separate payments 
taken by PayPal from her current account in the form of direct debits of £18.59, £24.55 and 
£28.85. 
Ms P is also unhappy that PayPal didnt allow her to load her debit card to her account, and 
clear her arrears, or take the payment from her two linked bank accounts. 
PayPal didnt uphold Ms Ps complaint. PayPal explained that they didnt set up any direct 
debits without Ms Ps consent or on a recurring basis. And Ms P owed PayPal £43.84. 
One of our investigators looked into Ms Ps complaint but didnt uphold it. She explained she 
was satisfied the transactions were authorised by Ms P. And, she thought PayPal acted fairly 
in contacting Ms P for the debt. 
Ms P didnt accept our investigators conclusion. In summary she said:
The payment on the 16 November 2019 wasnt related to fees for the online retailer 
E.
Further direct debits have been set up, without her consent, since her complaint on 
22 June and 24 June 2020.
PayPal need to address why they didnt take the funds from her bank account for the 
arears.
She made a payment to a business, Ill call W, but it was in store and via her Debit 
card.
As Ms P didnt accept our investigators conclusion, its been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And in doing so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why below. 
Ms P is unhappy that PayPal set up direct debits from her current account without her 
consent. The first payment that Ms P advises she didnt consent to is a £18.59 payment on 
the 18 November 2019. Ms P has explained that she believes this payment relates to a 
subscription for anti-virus software that she didnt sign up to. However, Im satisfied  based 
on the evidence provided by PayPal  that this payment was for fees to E. 
On the 15 May 2020 a payment of £28.58 was made via PayPal to W. This was refunded to 
Ms Ps account on the 31 May 2020. Ms P explains that she carried out the transaction in 
store and paid via her debit card  from the evidence Ive seen I think the transaction was in 
fact authorised via PayPal. And as Ms P has already received a refund for this payment 
theres nothing further for me to consider here. 
Ms P has also disputed a payment she received for £24.55 in December 2019. PayPal have 
provided evidence that this was withdrawn to Ms Ps bank account on the same day. Ive 
also seen documentation from PayPal that this refund relates to an item bought, via E, in 
November 2019 which was due to be shipped to Ms Ps address. I understand that Miss P 
doesnt remember making this purchase however ,on balance, I think its likely Ms P 
consented to this payment. 
Ms P has also queried two further payments on 22 June and 24 June 2020. Ive seen 
evidence from PayPal that two payments were authorised around this time for £48.99 and 
£40.05 to E. PayPal have confirmed that the first transaction of £48.99 was refunded to Ms P 
on the 24 June 2020. 
In conclusion, Ms P has advised our service that she believes PayPal have set up several 
direct debit instructions without her consent to be carried out on a regular basis. Id like to 
reassure Ms P that Ive taken her concerns seriously, but Ive not seen any evidence this is 
the case. From the evidence Ive seen all the transactions in dispute, apart from the payment 
for fees to E, were one off payments. And werent scheduled to be taken on a weekly, 
monthly or regular basis as Ms P fears. And a significant proportion of these payments have 
been refunded. This isnt something Id expect to see if a fraudster or PayPal were 
attempting to defraud Ms P. PayPal have also advised our service theres been no evidence 
of unauthorised access to Ms Ps account. 
Account arrears:
Ms Ps explained how shes confused PayPal didnt take the overdue amount, of £43.84 
from her linked bank accounts  and didnt allow her to pay via an active debit card. I 
understand that this debt has now been settled  following a payment Ms P received into her 
PayPal account. I appreciate that its been frustrating for Ms P to receive regular contact 
from PayPal about the debt, however Im satisfied that the debt was in fact owed. PayPal 
have explained that to pay a balance on her account Ms P needed to load a card with at 
least 1 month left prior to its expiry  and unfortunately the card Ms P was attempting to use 
expired that month. Im unable to say that PayPal acted unfairly here. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2021.
