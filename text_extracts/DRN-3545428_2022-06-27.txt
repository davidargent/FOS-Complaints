The complaint
Mr O complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to settle the claim 
he made through their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP) in the sellers favour.
What happened
In December 2021, Mr O purchased an item from an online retailer, who Ill refer to as W. 
Mr O used his PayPal account to process this transaction
But Mr O has said he didnt receive the item he paid for. So, in February 2022, Mr O raised 
an Item not received (INR) claim through PayPals BPP. As part of this process, PayPal 
contacted W in order to allow them the chance to defence Mr Os claim. And PayPal felt W 
provided them with evidence that showed the item had been delivered. So, they didnt think 
the claim should be upheld. 
Mr O disputed this, and PayPal decided to change Mr Os claim to significantly not as 
described (SNAD) before realising this was incorrect and changing the claim back to INR a 
week later. Mr O was unhappy about this, and the length of time hed been without the 
payment hed made, so he raised a complaint.
Mr O didnt think PayPal had acted fairly when considering the INR claim hed made through 
their BPP. He didnt think the tracking information W provided PayPal was genuine, as it 
didnt list his correct details or weight of the item hed ordered. And he was unhappy with the 
length of time PayPal had taken to decide the claim. So, he wanted a refund of the payment 
hed made to W and to be compensated for the upset hed been caused, alongside an 
apology.
PayPal responded to Mr Os complaint and didnt uphold it. They explained the claim was 
still open and hadnt yet been settled. But they offered to refund the total payment amount to 
Mr O, in full and final settlement of the complaint. Mr O accepted this refund, but he didnt 
think this was enough to resolve his complaint. So, he asked for our service to continue with 
our investigation.  While our service was investigating, PayPal settled the claim in Ws 
favour.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They agreed with Mr O that 
they didnt think PayPal acted fairly when accepted Ws proof of delivery as theyd received 
no evidence to show the details contained within this matched that of Mr O. But our 
investigator explained that to recognise this, they would expect PayPal to refund the 
payment to Mr O. And PayPal had already done this within their complaint response. 
Because of this, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more. Our investigator also 
noted Mr O had an issue with a second item he ordered. But as this was ordered after 
PayPals final response, they explained this would need to be raised under a separate 
complaint. 
Mr O didnt agree. He maintained his view that PayPal should be forced to stop W from 
using their services. And he thought he was owed an apology for the upset hed been 
caused by the situation. As Mr O didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr O. I appreciate he 
purchased an item from W with no reason to doubt this item wouldnt be delivered. So, when 
he didnt receive this item, I can understand why hed be left upset and feeling as though 
hed fallen victim to a scam. And as Mr O made the purchase using his PayPal account, I 
understand why Mr O turned to them under the BPP they provide. I can also appreciate why 
Mr O assumed his claim would be upheld and the upset he felt when he received information 
to suggest it wouldnt be.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful to explain what Ive 
been able to consider and crucially, what Im able to direct.
I recognise Mr O is unhappy with the actions of W. And because of this, he thinks PayPal 
should block W from using their services to prevent similar situations arising in the future. 
But our service is unable to comment upon or make any sort of direction involving who 
PayPal should or shouldnt allow to use their service as this falls outside of our jurisdiction. 
So, this isnt something Ive thought about any further. I recognise Mr O also wants an 
apology for the situation and the fact he didnt receive the item he paid for. But I wouldnt 
expect PayPal to issue an apology about this, as the issue in delivery has been caused by 
W, not PayPal themselves. 
Finally, I appreciate Mr O is unhappy that PayPal settled the claim in Ws favour and so, they 
werent made to refund the payment to PayPal. But as Mr O has received a refund from 
PayPal, the financial loss caused by W not refunding this amount is now the loss of 
PayPals, not Mr Os. And PayPal are entitled to take their own decision regarding whether 
they want to recover this loss or not. So, I havent considered this loss to PayPal when 
deciding the complaint.
Instead, Ive focused on whether PayPal acted in line with the terms of the BPP when 
settling the claim in Ws favour, and whether I think they were fair to do so. This BPP doesnt 
act as a warranty for any items purchased through PayPal but is instead intended to provide 
those using PayPal to purchase items some protection if things go wrong. But as this isnt a 
warranty, a refund through PayPals BPP isnt a guarantee, nor is it a right for a customer. 
So, for a claim to be upheld and a payment refunded, a buyer must satisfy the terms of the 
BPP.
In this situation, Mr O submitted an INR claim. PayPals BPP explains a customer will not 
receive a refund through this type of claim if a seller, in this case W, can provide proof of 
delivery.
I can see W responded to PayPals information request with a tracking number for a delivery 
service. So, PayPal have considered this to be proof of delivery and so, decided to settle the 
claim in Ws favour. As they received proof of delivery, I think they acted within the terms of the BPP when doing so. But I dont think this was fair.
Ive seen no evidence to show the tracking information W provided to PayPal related to Mr 
Os purchase. Nor can I see that it contained the correct details for Mr Os delivery, such as 
the address and the details of who signed for the item. So, although PayPal did receive 
delivery information from W, I dont think they considered this fairly. And because of this, I 
dont think PayPal wouldve been fair not to return the payment to Mr O.
But I can see this payment has already been refunded to Mr O as a gesture of good will. And 
this is what I wouldve directed PayPal to do. As this action has already been taken, Ive then 
thought about whether PayPal should do anything more than this. And I dont think they 
should.
While I recognise it took PayPal almost a month from the date of Mr Os initial claim to the 
refund, I dont think this is an unreasonable amount of time. I can see PayPal gave both Mr 
O and W time to provide further information to assist their investigation. And as there was a 
clear dispute between Mr Os testimony and the information W provided, I think this is likely 
to have made the investigation of the claim more complex and so, it would require more time 
to conclude. So, even though I do think PayPal may have handled the claim in a more 
effective way, I dont think there was a significant delay that means they should compensate 
Mr O.
And although I appreciate the claim wasnt settled in the way Mr O had hoped, I cant say 
this has impacted him financially as he received a refund of the payment he made. As Ive 
explained above, I wont be compensating Mr O for a financial loss to PayPal themselves.
I can also see that Mr O has raised concerns about the information reported to his credit file, 
which he says is directly linked to his dispute with PayPal about this claim. But hes since 
confirmed this has been altered and the payment is showing as paid. I recognise he says his 
credit score is still less than it was before this issue, but I have no way of knowing for sure if 
this was due to the way PayPal have reported to his credit file. So, this isnt something I can 
say PayPal are responsible for. And so, I cant say Mr O should be compensated for this.
Mr O is also unhappy that his credit account with PayPal remains open. This is something 
Mr O will need to take up with PayPal directly as I cant see this is something he complained 
about previously.
So, although I do think that PayPal assessed Mr Os claim unfairly, I dont think they need to 
do anything more as they have already refunded the payment to him, which is what I 
wouldve expected them to do. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Os complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2022.
