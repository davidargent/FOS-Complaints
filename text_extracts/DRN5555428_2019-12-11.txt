K821x#15complaint
Mrs G says Uncle Buck Finance LLP (Uncle  Buck) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 22 November  2019  where  I set out a 
detailed background to the complaint and my initial thoughts.  My provisional decision  and 
background is attached and forms part of this final decision. 
I gave both parties the opportunity to send me further comments  or evidence before issuing 
a final decision.
The time to respond  to my provisional  decision  has now passed. Mrs G hasnt provided a 
response. Uncle Buck has responded to say it had nothing further to add.
my findings
Ive again reconsidered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided any further comments or evidence,  I see no reason to depart 
from the conclusions  reached in my provisional decision.
Uncle Buck  shouldnt have lent Mrs G loan 1 and it needs to put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs G paid on loan 1;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 1 from Mrs Gs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. 
Uncle Buck  must give Mrs G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Gs complaint in part and require Uncle Buck Finance LLP to put things right as 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 January 2020.

background
This complaint is about  four instalment loans Uncle Buck provided to Mrs G between March  2015 
and October  2015. Mrs Gs borrowing history is as follows:
loan

(£)repayment 
(£) end date
1 07/03/2015 100 45.80 25/03/2015

4 28/10/2015 250 124.45 25/11/2015
Two adjudicators looked  into the complaint.  The first adjudicator thought  that Uncle  Buck 
shouldnt have given  Mrs G loan 4. A second adjudicator reviewed the complaint and thought  
that the results of Uncle Bucks search into Mrs Gs credit file showed that she couldnt afford 
any of the loans.
Uncle Buck disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve  set out our general  approach to complaints about  
short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on our 
website.
Uncle Buck needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice  
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mrs G could repay 
the loans in a sustainable  manner.  These  checks  could take into account a number of different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and the consumers income  
and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship,  I think  less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given  loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck has said before lending  to Mrs G, it searched her credit file, asked her about  her 
monthly income and expenses.  It has provided the results of its search into Mrs Gs file before  
lending loans  1, 3 and 4. From the results of those searches, Mrs G didnt have any defaults or 
county court judgements  (CCJs) recorded on her file.
Ref: DRN55554284Mrs G declared her income as varying from £1,250 to £2,080   this includes the additional income  
of £500 Mrs G received  from loan 2 onwards.  Mrs Gs declared expenses varied from £900 to 
£940 and it included;
expenses loan 1 loan 2 loan 3 loan 4
mortgage 450 450 450 450
store/credit card 145 145 145 145
other amount 50 50 50 50
transport 0 40 40 40
utilities 120 120 120 120
food 135 135 135 135
The results  of Uncle Bucks checks for loan 1 show that Mrs G was borrowing from other short term 
lenders and had two loans outstanding with a total value  of £100.  The results also showed  that Mrs 
G had monthly repayments of around £1,195 on other credit commitments  which likely  included 
things like her mortgage  and fixed loans. Taking into account Mrs G spent around £345 on food, 
transport and utility and her income was around £1,250, she didnt  have enough to make the 
repayments of loan 1. And so Uncle  Buck  shouldnt have lent her this loan as her outgoings  
outweighed her income.
I havent seen the results of Uncle Bucks credit search for loan 2 but Mrs G declared her income 
as £1,790  and her living  expenses including  housing  as £940, from the limited information 
available, I think Uncle Bucks checks for this loan went far enough. And those checks  suggest  
that Mrs G could afford the repayment of loan 2.
Mrs Gs expenses at the time of loans 3 and 4 were similar  to loan 2. Uncle  Buck has provided  the 
results of its credit search for these loans. The second adjudicator explained  that Mrs G had 
monthly repayments on fixed loans  of around £1,147 and £1,172 at the time of loans 3 and 4 and 
this was apparent to Uncle Buck from its credit  searches..
I can see that Uncle Bucks  search did show  that she was repaying those sums but taking into 
account her income of £1,790 at the time of loan 3 and £2,080 at the time of loan 4, she had 
sufficient income  to afford the repayments on those loans. Even after deducting her costs for food, 
travel and utilities  which amounted to around £345 for both these  loans.
Mrs G has also provided copies of her bank statements and from those, I cant see that she had 
other short  term loans outstanding at the time of loans, 2 to 4. And I cant  see that there was 
anything obvious from her bank statements that wouldve meant  Uncle Buck  shouldnt have lent to 
her.
Also, I dont think Mrs G had established an obvious  pattern of reliance on these  loans that 
shouldve concerned Uncle Buck about lending.
And so I dont think Uncle Buck wrongly lent loans 2 to 4.
I appreciate that Mrs G says she was stuck in a debt spiral and Im sorry  she had to go through that 
and I know that my findings  are likely to disappoint Mrs G. But I hope my explanation helps her 
understand why I currently think Uncle  Buck wasnt wrong  to lend her loans 2 to 4 but it shouldnt 
have lent her loan 1.
So Im minded to uphold loan 1 only and Uncle  Buck  should  put things right in relation to loan 1.
