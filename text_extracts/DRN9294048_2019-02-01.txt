K820x#14complaint
Mr F, who is represented  by a firm of solicitors, complains that PSA Finance UK Limited 
(PSA) has overcharged him for excess mileage  on a car he acquired with a hire purchase 
agreement. 
background
In January 2015 Mr F acquired a car under a hire purchase agreement with PSA.  The 
agreement was for 37 months and the annual  mileage of 10,000. Excess mileage  was 
chargeable at 0.8 p per mile. The car suffered  a fault and the garage  loaned him a car, but 
when the original was returned the engine blew up and Mr F was given the loan car as a 
replacement vehicle in June 2016. PSA says that Mr F had covered 31,147 miles  in the 
original car and the starting mileage  for the replacement  was 12,506. 
PSA has acknowledged  that the invoice sent to it by the dealer for the replacement car 
showed a mileage of 9,100, but it was aware this was incorrect. The dealer had reported that 
when the car had been loaned to him it had 8,062 miles on the clock  and when  it was 
brought in for some repairs shortly  before  it was given  to him as a full time replacement  it 
had done 12,506 miles.
PSA also says that it sent him a quote  to increase his mileage  in February  2017  and after he 
contacted it further  quotes were sent in April. It says he didnt respond to these so his 
contractual allowance remained at 30,000.
The car was returned in March 2018  having  done 70,435 miles. Mr F was sent an invoice for 
excess mileage of £2,697.01 which was calculated  as 40,435  miles at 6.67p per mile. The 
invoice also included a charge of £252 for damage  and £184.45 for funded insurance. 
Mr F complained and said he hadnt done  the mileage claimed by PSA as the replacement 
car had a higher mileage when he took it over. He accepted the funded  insurance  charge but 
disputed the damage charge as he said the replacement car had been damaged when he 
was given it. PSA rejected his complaint and the matter was referred  to this service. It was 
considered by one of our investigators who didnt  recommend it be upheld.
She sought clarification  from PSA as to how it had calculated the excess  mileage charge. It 
said that strictly it should have charged  Mr F £4,726.08. It explained that the original car had 
been returned having done 31,147 miles and the replacement had done 57, 929 (70,435  
12,506) while Mr F had it. It also said that his agreement had been for a mileage  charge of 
8p but it had charged  a lower rate.
It added that if he had amended his agreement to increase his annual mileage he would  also 
have paid more  than he had been  charged. Mr Fs solicitor said that the replacement had car 
a higher mileage  than 12,506 when  he when it was given to him in June 2016. He suggested 
it was in excess of 19,000. They  said Mr F had asked  for evidence of the mileage from PSA, 
but without success.
The investigator concluded that PSA hadnt made  excessive charges. She noted  that it could 
have pursued Mr F for a significantly larger sum.  She also thought the charge for damage 
was fair.
Ref: DRN92940482Mr Fs solicitors didnt  agree and asked for evidence of the mileage of the replacement  car 
when it was handed over to Mr F. It also disputed the damage charge. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here),  I reach my decision on the balance of 
probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in the light of 
the available  evidence and the wider circumstances.
I think it is reasonable to conclude  that Mr F was doing a much  higher mileage than the 
10,000 in the agreement. He had travelled 31,147  miles in some 14 months  in the first car 
and I am not aware that this is disputed. Therefore,  it is not unreasonable to conclude that 
he significantly exceeded his agreed mileage. This is supported by the fact car he was, at 
one point, contemplating amending the agreement to allow  for a higher mileage.
The replacement car was just under a year old when it was given to Mr F in June  2016  and I 
gather it had been used a as hire car. A mileage of 12,506  is not an unusual figure for such a 
car. We only have the claim  by the dealer that it had done 12,506 when it was handed over. 
Mr F cannot say what the mileage was but he believes it was in excess of 19,000. That 
statement implies that it wasnt  much more than 19,000 otherwise I presume he would have 
given a higher  round  sum figure.
Even if I were to accept  the mileage was 19,000  or even 20,000 then the correct  excess 
mileage charge would  be in excess  of what he has been charged.  Therefore, on balance  I 
cannot say that the mileage charged levied by PSA is unreasonable. I would add that I note 
Mr F has said that he was told there  would  be no charges, but I dont consider this to be 
binding on PSA, if indeed that is what he was told. 
As for the damage  charge the faults were  detailed by the third party company which  
collected the car. I am satisfied this was done  in accordance with British Vehicle Rental 
Leasing Association  guidelines. I appreciate Mr F says the car was damaged when he was 
given it, but I have see no evidence to support that claim and as he made the most use of 
the car it is not unreasonable to presume it was damaged  while under his care. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or reject  my decision before 
1 March 2019.
