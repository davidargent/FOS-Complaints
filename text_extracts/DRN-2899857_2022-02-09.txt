The complaint
Mr N and Mrs N complain that National Westminster Bank Plc closed their bank account 
without their knowledge.
What happened
Mr N and Mrs N had a joint bank account with NatWest. The account was registered to an 
address in the United Kingdom. Mr N and Mrs N say they didnt ever live at this address  
they lived abroad. But it was an address used by a family member while at university.
In 2018, they sold the property but didnt tell NatWest about this. In 2019, NatWest sent a 
letter to the address that was returned through the postal service. NatWest then referred the 
matter to its collections department, who says it tried to contact Mr N and Mrs N by writing to 
them and by attempting to contact them by telephone. NatWest says it also instructed a 
tracing agent, who tried to find up to date contact details for Mr N and Mrs N  but this was 
inconclusive. NatWest therefore proposed to withdraw Mr N and Mrs Ns overdraft. It issued 
a default notice in November 2019, and a formal demand in December 2019. In January 
2020, it transferred the account to its recoveries department. This meant NatWest had 
withdrawn Mr N and Mrs Ns banking facilities, and so the account would only remain open 
until Mr N and Mrs N had repaid their overdraft.
At around this time, Mr N says he contacted NatWest to check the balance on the account. 
As the account was withdrawn, Mr N made a payment of £4,963.51 into the account at the 
end of January 2020. This was enough to repay the overdraft. As the overdraft was now 
repaid, NatWest transferred the remaining balance into a suspense account, and then, in 
April, closed the account.
Mr N says he didnt find out about this until August 2020. And as a result, direct debits have 
been cancelled  and a life insurance policy in the name of Mr N has been cancelled for 
missed payments. He was also told that the account was closed with a nil balance, and 
that it took him some time to discover what had happened to the remaining funds. Mr N and 
Mrs N are unhappy NatWest closed the account  and so referred the complaint to us.
I issued my provisional findings on this complaint on 17 December 2021. I said that based 
on what Id seen, I didnt think NatWest had acted unreasonably in closing the account. But it 
could have explained what it had done better. So I proposed that NatWest pay Mr N and Mrs 
N £200 to reflect the trouble and upset it had caused.
I first noted that the terms and conditions of Mr N and Mrs Ns account said that NatWest 
could close any current account by giving Mr N and Mrs N at least 60 days notice. Similarly, 
the terms of the overdraft said that it was repayable on demand, so NatWest could ask Mr 
N and Mrs N to repay the full amount at any time.
In addition, the terms said that NatWest could contact Mr N and Mrs N by post, phone, 
email, secure message, text message or via the mobile banking app. Term 6.3 stated that If 
your contact details change, you should tell us as soon as you can to ensure you receive our 
communications.
Based on what Id seen, Mr N and Mrs N told NatWest it could use the address in the United 
Kingdom as their postal address. The records showed that they gave NatWest this address 
in March 2014, which was around the same time that Mr N and Mrs N say they left the UK.
A few months before this, Mr N and Mrs N gave NatWest a mobile phone number. I see this 
number is the same number they provided this service in connection with this complaint  so 
I was satisfied that this was likely to be a number Mr N and Mrs N continued to use.
The terms and conditions of the account said that Mr N and Mrs N had a responsibility to 
update NatWest if these contact details changed.
I noted that Mr N said he told his relationship manager from the bank that he was living 
abroad. And hed sent us an email from 2016 in which he asked this manager to contact him 
using an overseas telephone number. But I couldnt see that he told NatWest to change his 
existing details or that it couldnt contact him at the address or using the number hed given 
it. And I noted that in 2016, Mr N and Mrs Ns family member was still using the address in 
the UK. On balance, I thought Mr N and Mrs N chose to keep their account registered at the 
address in the UK and didnt tell NatWest when they sold the property. Although Mr N and 
Mrs N said this is because the country they lived in didnt have an established postal system, 
I thought that made it all the more important to ensure they could still receive 
communications. Otherwise there was a real risk that important correspondence would be 
missed.
I then turned to NatWests decision to close the account. The terms and conditions allowed 
NatWest to ask Mr N and Mrs N to repay the overdraft on demand  and to close the 
account by giving at least 60 days notice. I was satisfied that closing the account was 
something the terms and conditions allowed NatWest to do. I noted that at the point NatWest 
first contacted Mr N and Mrs N they were still using their overdraft which was increasing, but 
hadnt made any payments into the account for nearly six months, which was a potential 
indicator that the arrangement had become unaffordable. NatWest then discovered that Mr 
N and Mrs N could no longer be contacted through the address it held. In the circumstances, 
I dont think the decision to withdraw the overdraft, and close the account, was 
unreasonable.
Mr N and Mrs N say they didnt receive any such notice and demand, and Ive thought about 
that. I see that NatWests records show that it wrote to Mr N and Mrs N at the address theyd 
given them several times, but these letters were returned undelivered through the postal 
service  so NatWest would have known Mr N and Mrs N wouldnt have received them. That 
said, NatWests records also make reference to a number of attempts to contact Mr N and 
Mrs N by telephone  in August, October and November 2019. NatWest has also provided a 
statement from the tracing agent who it appointed to find new details for Mr N and Mrs N. It 
says that it would have attempted to contact Mr N and Mrs N with any telephony details 
supplied.
On balance, I found that NatWest and its agents attempted to contact Mr N and Mrs N by 
both telephone and by letter using the details it had on file. And so I thought NatWest made 
reasonable attempts to contact Mr N and Mrs N before it closed the account. While I 
acknowledged that NatWest might have tried to contact Mr N using the email address it had 
on file, or by using a contact number hed left with his relationship manager in connection 
with some mortgage advice in 2016, I didnt think it unreasonable for it not to. Mr N and Mrs 
N were responsible for keeping their contact details up to date  but they didnt. And I was 
satisfied that the number NatWest held was one Mr N still had access to. I also think Mr N 
and Mrs N had a responsibility to manage the account on a day-to-day basis. Based on what 
Ive seen, Mr N rarely checked his internet banking: indeed, although NatWest told us Mr N 
would have lost access to online banking when it passed the account to its debt management department in July 2019, Mr N didnt notice this had happened until November 
2019. The final direct debit left the account in November 2019,  but Mr N didnt notice his 
account had closed until August 2020, over 9 months later.
I was also mindful that Mr N had told us hed already had difficulties operating the account 
because he was located overseas. He says he was unable to authorise his personal details 
because his debit card had expired  in my experience this would ordinarily have been 
replaced by post. He says he knew hed lost access to internet banking from November 
2019 onwards  and this was another of the methods of communication NatWest were 
allowed to use under the terms and conditions. But all this meant that from November 2019 
onwards Mr N knew he no longer had access to his statements, either by post or online  
and this means he had no way of knowing what transactions were being made from his and 
Mrs Ns account. I didnt feel I could hold NatWest responsible of Mr N and Mrs N chose to 
access their account in this way. I recognised that Mr N and Mrs N said this only came to 
light in August 2020 when Mr N contacted NatWest to check the balance of the account. But 
Mr N had a number of direct debits leaving the account  two to fund investments from his 
family, and another for a life and critical illness policy. I found it surprising, on the face of it, 
that neither of those other businesses contacted Mr N to let him know his direct debits had 
been cancelled. With this in mind, even if NatWest might have done more to contact Mr N 
and Mrs N, I didnt think I could reasonably hold NatWest responsible if Mr N was unaware 
that his life insurance had been cancelled or that he hadnt been making payments to his 
other accounts.
That said, I did note that NatWest initially told Mr N and Mrs N it had closed the account with 
a nil balance. Mr N sent us copies of letters showing this from August and September 2020. 
In the meantime, Mr N had contacted both his bank overseas and a money transfer service 
to find out what had happened to his payment.
While I can see that what NatWest told Mr N was technically true  the money was 
transferred from Mr N and Mrs Ns account before the account was closed  I thought 
NatWest could have explained what had happened more clearly. I thought this had caused 
Mr N and Mrs N material distress and inconvenience. So I thought NatWest should pay Mr N 
and Mrs N £200 for the distress and inconvenience this caused.
I said Id consider any further comments I received by 14 January 2022.
Mr N and Mrs N have disagreed with my provisional decision for a number of reasons.
Mr N says that hed been a private banking customer of NatWest since 2008  and 
that before he left the UK his private banking manager told him he could still run his 
account with the same terms and conditions even though he wasnt in the UK  and 
that he could be contacted by email. But he was also advised that it would be better 
for him to have an address in the UK for their records, even if he wasnt living there. 
His manager changed in 2016, who emailed him to say NatWest could keep him in 
private banking services. He only discovered in 2020 that he was no longer a private 
banking customer. If NatWest had kept him in private banking, his manager could 
have notified him directly. He is convinced that a financial institution cannot withdraw 
an important service from a privileged customer without discussing the matter with 
the account holder.
He had not received any further communication from his private bank manager since 
December 2016.
They never received any notice that the account would be closed.
Although NatWest made some effort to contact them, they should have tried to 
contact them by email.
His private bank manager had his overseas telephone number.Although he was using his overdraft, he remained within his limit and regularly 
transferred funds once or twice a year to keep the balance within the overdraft limit.
He says one reason NatWest closed his account was as he was no longer a legal 
resident of the European Union (EU). So NatWest ought to have tried to trace him in 
the EU, in which case it would have found his permanent address in another EU 
member state.
When he contacted NatWest in October 2019, when he lost access to mobile 
banking, he was told he needed to update his personal details, not that the account 
had been passed to the collections department.
As his debit card had expired in 2016 and not been replaced, he was told he could 
only update his details in person when he returned to the UK.
He had full access to internet banking until October 2019, but was never notified that 
his overdraft limit had changed.
He feels that NatWest is finding excuses to close his account, as its explanation 
keeps changing.
Hes unhappy that NatWest continued to close the account even after he paid 
enough funds into the account to come out of the overdraft.
He has not asked for compensation from NatWest  he just wanted his accounts 
returned to the position they were in before all this happened.
NatWest agreed with my provisional findings. Ive therefore reviewed the complaint again..
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered the points Mr N and Mrs N have raised. But they dont change my 
conclusions.
Mr N and Mrs N were ultimately responsible for making sure NatWest had an up-to-date 
postal address. They didnt. Based on what Mr N and Mrs N have said, they chose to 
register their account to the address in the UK. They then sold the property at that address. 
As a result, they didnt receive important communications from NatWest  and thats not 
NatWests fault. 
NatWest then made reasonable efforts to contact Mr N and Mrs N by other means. I see 
they engaged tracing agents to try and locate Mr N and Mrs N, but these efforts were 
inconclusive. But given there was an overdraft on the account, and it was clear that Mr N 
and Mrs N were no longer contactable at the UK address, I dont find it surprising that 
NatWest both terminated the overdraft and decided to close the account.
Ive considered Mr N and Mrs Ns further comments. I already addressed many of these in 
my provisional decision. I acknowledge that Mr N at one point was part of NatWests private 
banking services. It is not now clear when Mr Ns account was moved from private banking  
NatWest says that because of the passage of time it cannot now comment on why or when 
this happened. But I note that Mr N and Mrs N also say their debit card wasnt replaced after 
it expired in 2016. And as I said in my provisional decision, this tends to suggest Mr N and 
Mrs N were already missing out on important communications about their account, even 
before they sold their UK property. The terms and conditions required Mr N and Mrs N to 
keep their address up to date. It also listed post as one of the methods NatWest could 
contact them by. It was therefore essential that Mr N and Mrs N made sure they could still be 
contacted by post.I also note that although Mr N gave his bank manager an overseas mobile number in 
connection with some mortgage advice, nothing in this email suggests that he intended to 
change the number associated with his account. Mr N suggests this was given to his bank 
manager as an emergency contact. But the email doesnt say this - it appears to relate to a 
one-off piece of mortgage advice. The number held by NatWest was also one Mr N gave this 
service as a contact number in connection with this complaint. So it seems he still had some 
access to it.
I note Mr Ns comments about his address in an EU member state. To be clear, although the 
investigator said NatWest could close the account if Mr N was no longer resident in the EU, 
the terms and conditions of the account said that NatWest could in fact close the account for 
any reason. NatWests concerns here appear to be that Mr N and Mrs N could no longer be 
contacted at their permanent address. And as Ive already said that it was Mr N and Mrs Ns 
responsibility to keep their permanent address up to date, I cant say NatWest made a 
mistake in not discovering this other address by itself. In any case, Mr N previously told us 
that his other permanent address was empty and so of no use for postal delivery, so it 
doesnt seem he could have been contacted there either.
Finally, Ive considered Mr Ns comments about the compensation for trouble and upset I 
recommended in my provisional decision. I recognised that although NatWest hadnt acted 
unreasonably in closing Mr N and Mrs Ns account, it could nevertheless have explained 
what happened better, particularly with respect to what happened to the outstanding 
balance. Mr N thinks I have misunderstood his complaint as he has not asked for 
compensation. Nevertheless, under our rules I may award such amount as I consider to be 
fair compensation for distress or inconvenience. As I think NatWest caused Mr N and Mrs N 
material inconvenience, I proposed to make an award to reflect this.
Ive considered Mr Ns other comments. But they dont change my conclusions.
In summary, what happened here ultimately stemmed from Mr N and Mrs Ns failure to make 
sure their contact details, and in particularly their postal address, was up to date. This is not 
NatWests fault. And it therefore follows that I wont be asking NatWest to reinstate the 
account.
Putting things right
NatWest should pay Mr N and Mrs N £200 to reflect the inconvenience it caused. I make no 
further award.
My final decision
For the reasons above and in my provisional decision, I uphold the complaint in part. 
National Westminster Bank plc should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N and Mrs N to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
