K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  irresponsibly  lent to him. 
He said he felt he had no choice at the time as he needed  money   but the lending was 
unreliable and exorbitant as the interest was too much and put him in more  debt. Mr S wants  
the balance written off and a refund of the interest and extra  charges he paid. 
background
QuickQuid provided  Mr S with twelve payday loans between July 2012 and June 2017. He 
took out loans that ranged between  £50 and £400, sometimes topping  up a loan with some 
additional borrowing. After loan 4, there was a gap of more  than two years before Mr S 
started borrowing  again. So Ive looked at these two chains of loans separately. 
Heres a table setting out loan details:

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ss complaint and thought loan 4 in chain 1 and loans 4 to 8 in 
chain 2 shouldn't have  been lent to Mr S.
 
QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint comes to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN61577882Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr S to see if there  was 
a point at which QuickQuid reasonably shouldve seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Thats when QuickQuid shouldve  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN61577883The first chain started with loan 1 and ended with loan 4 when  there was a gap of a couple  
of years or so before Mr S asked to borrow again. I think  that break in the lending  was long 
enough for QuickQuid  to be able to say that it looked like Mr Ss finances  had moved on 
since hed needed  his previous loans and enough time had gone  by to reset any concerns 
QuickQuid mightve had about Mr S being dependent on its lending.
I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to give the first three  loans to Mr S. Looking at the 
amounts Mr S needed  to repay, what was apparent about his circumstances at the time, and 
his history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask 
him for the amount of information that would be needed to show  the lending  was 
unsustainable. And it doesnt  look like there was anything in the information Mr S provided or 
the information QuickQuid shouldve been  aware  of, which meant it wouldve been 
proportionate to start verifying what he was saying.   
But, looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Mr S, I think by loan 4 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. By loan 4 in chain 1, QuickQuid was able to see signs that suggested Mr S was 
struggling to repay some  of his previous loans. Hed been late making  some  of his 
repayments on loans  1 and 3 and had incurred late fees as a result. Hed also topped  up 
loan 2 with additional funds within 5 days or so of arranging the borrowing. In these 
circumstances, I think  there was a significant risk that Mr S would've  been unable to 
sustainably meet his repayments for this loan - and any subsequent loans. By the time Mr S 
took out loan 4 almost a year had passed since hed taken his first loan. Hed had some 
problems paying  these back on time and hed paid quite a lot of interest and late fees to 
QuickQuid to effectively  service a debt over an extended period. Ive taken into account that 
QuickQuid has already made an offer to Mr S in respect  of loan 2 - but dont think  QuickQuid 
was wrong to give the second loan so I am not going to be recommending it pays  any 
compensation in that regard. 
I dont think QuickQuid shouldve given loan 4 to Mr S.
 
Following the break in lending, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to 
ask Mr S for the amount  of information that would be needed to show loans  1-3 in chain 2 
were unsustainable.  So QuickQuid wasnt wrong  to give these loans to Mr S.
Mr S asked QuickQuid for loan 4 in this chain  of lending a couple of weeks or so after paying 
off a loan hed incurred late payment fees on. I think at this point QuickQuid  shouldve  been 
concerned he was facing serious problems managing his money. 
By loan 4, Mr Ss overall pattern of borrowing suggested that hed become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans. Hed taken out these 4 loans in chain 2 over a period of around 
9 months. The amounts  he borrowed were generally increasing over this period, and he was 
taking additional  top ups as well. Mr S also defaulted on the repayments of several of those 
loans.
In my view, the pattern  of lending itself shows that by loan 4 and onwards that borrowing 
was unsustainable  for Mr S - so I dont  think QuickQuid shouldve  given  Mr S loans 4 
through to 8 in this chain.
I think that QuickQuid shouldve concluded  that the lending history  alone indicated that the 
borrowing was unsustainable.  
Ref: DRN61577884I say this because:
Although there were  some limited gaps  between loans being  repaid and a new loan 
being granted I dont think it wouldve been  reasonable  for QuickQuid  to conclude 
these gaps were any indication that Mr Ss finances had moved  on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans. 
By the time Mr S asked for loan 4 hed been  borrowing  from QuickQuid repeatedly 
and in quick succession and he wasnt making  any inroads into the amount he owed 
the lender. By then Mr S had again paid a considerable amount of interest  (and late 
fees) to QuickQuid to effectively service a debt over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards when:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Ss ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
Ive taken into account what QuickQuid says about this lending,  and the offers it made. But 
this doesnt affect  my overall view for the reasons Ive explained. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 4 in chain 1, and loans 4 through to 8 in chain 2 
and QuickQuid should put things  right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mr S:
chain 1 - loan 4 (15/06/2013) and
chain 2 - loan 4 (29/07/2016) to loan 8 (29/05/17)
So for each of those  loans  QuickQuid  should:
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
In the event any refund has already been  paid, QuickQuid can deduct from the amount 
owing to Mr S any refund  already  paid in respect  of loan 2 in chain 1.
Remove any adverse  information on Mr Ss credit file in relation to loan 4 in chain 1.
The number of loans  taken from loan 4 in chain 2 onwards  means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 4 to 8 in chain 2 should  be 
removed from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr S has an outstanding balance on his final loan to QuickQuid. This debt may have been 
sold to a third party  debt collection company as Mr S has been unable  to make repayments. 
Ref: DRN61577885I havent seen  anything to make  me think Mr S shouldnt repay the principal  he borrowed 
from the lender.  So it seems reasonable that if Mr S still owes  some of the capital he 
borrowed that should be repaid using part of the refund he is due. But to do so CashEuroNet  
must first take the debt back into its own books if it has sold it on and reduce it to reflect  just 
the capital that Mr S borrowed. If CashEuroNet is unable, or unwilling, to do this it must 
ensure that its interest and charges, and any other interest and charges added  by the debt 
collection company,  are refunded to Mr S so he can choose whether to use the 
compensation to settle his debt directly.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 July 2019.
