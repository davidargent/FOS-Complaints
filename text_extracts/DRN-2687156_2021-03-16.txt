The complaint
Mr P is unhappy about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs (PayPal) customer service.
What happened
Mr P complained to PayPal about payments and its customer service and said that it didnt 
properly deal with complaints.
PayPal responded and offered Mr P £50 to address the concerns about a pending 
transaction, which Mr P accepted.
Mr P complained to this service. Our investigator initially said she thought the complaint was 
out of our jurisdiction because it was about complaint handling, which isnt a regulated 
activity. 
Following further comments from Mr P, our investigator then looked at specific instances of 
Mr P contacting PayPal. Having done so, our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She 
said she had seen evidence that PayPal had dealt with the logged complaints. She also said 
she hadnt seen evidence to show that PayPal wasnt recording instances when Mr P made 
contact.
As Mr P did not agree, the complaint has been referred to me.
 
I issued my provisional decision on 3 February 2021. In my provisional decision, I explained 
the reasons why I was planning not to uphold the complaint. I said:
The details of what happened are known to both parties, so I wont be repeating them here. 
But, in summary, Mr P has complained about the customer service hes received from 
PayPal and, in particular, how its gone about dealing with complaints hes made.
In this provisional decision, I need to make it clear that complaint handling itself isnt a 
regulated activity. Im aware that our investigator has already explained this to Mr P. I 
therefore wont be making a finding on how PayPal deals with complaints, as it is outside the 
remit of this service to do so.
However, Ive looked at the instances of poor service that Mr P has referred to and can see 
that PayPal offered him £50 by way of full and final settlement, which Mr P has accepted. Mr 
P still brought his complaint about poor customer service to us, which he is entitled to do. So 
Ive looked at the position.
I note that PayPal wont share the call recordings of conversations it had with Mr P, which 
makes it more difficult for this service to deal with the case. However, based on the 
information available to me from both parties, I think £50 is a fair and reasonable settlement 
in respect of the problems Mr P has experienced, so Im not proposing to uphold his 
complaint.
I asked both parties to send me any more information or evidence they wanted me to look at 
by 5 March 2021.
Mr P queried the £50 referred to as he didnt remember receiving this. He also explained that 
his main concern was PayPals overall complaint handling.
PayPal didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to maintain my previous decision not to uphold this complaint, 
as I think that PayPal took reasonable steps to investigate Mr Ps complaint and to ensure 
that Mr P received the credit he was expecting in his account.
Mr P requested further details of the £50 previously offered by PayPal, which I understand 
has been provided.
Mr P has also explained his concerns about PayPals overall complaint handling and some 
of the issues he has experienced as a result of this. The rules explaining what complaints 
this service can deal with are set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the Dispute 
Resolution: Complaints handbook (DISP). For this service to look at a complaint, it needs to 
be a regulated activity as set out in DISP, as applicable to our Voluntary Jurisdiction, which 
PayPal is subject to. The way a business has handled a complaint isnt a regulated activity. 
So, as I explained in my provisional decision, this means that we cant look at complaint 
handling itself.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above and in my provisional decision, my final decision is that this 
complaint is not upheld.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
