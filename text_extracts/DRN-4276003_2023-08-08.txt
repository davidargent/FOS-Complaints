The complaint
Mr R complains that Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited (LV) mishandled a 
claim on his motor insurance policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a car, first registered in January 2009 
with a 58 registration plate.
Mr S acquired the car in 2015.
For the year from late May 2021, Mr R had a comprehensive LV policy for the car. He 
renewed the policy from late May 2022. Any claim was subject to an excess of £350.00.
Unfortunately, in mid-August 2022, the car was damaged in an accident. LV said the car was 
a total loss and its pre-accident value had been £4,350.00. Mr R complained to LV that it 
was under-valuing the car.
By a final response, LV referred to the following trade guide valuations:
Glasss £3,380.00 
CAP £4,153.00
Parkers £4,220.00
LV said that it had sent £4,350.00 less the £350.00 excess, that is £4,000.00. But LV 
apologised for not having sent its cheque when it said it would. So it said it had sent a 
cheque for £100.00 as an apology. Mr R asked us to investigate.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
LV had acted unreasonably. He thought that £100.00 was reasonable in the circumstances 
for the upset caused by its delay in the claim settlement. 
Mr R disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that: 
We should accept his experts report valuing the car at £5,763.00.
The FCA has warned insurance companies not to undervalue cars.
The FCA has ordered another insurance company to review claims and identify any 
policyholders who received unfair settlements.
The trade guide figures need proper and expert adjustments for the specific details of 
each vehicle to get to a realistic, fair and reasonable result. 
The guides give part-exchange values.
All the dealers he approached at the time confirmed that £4,350.00 was not realistic.
A comparable vehicle was on sale at £5,695.00, and sold at around that price.
He is about £1,500.00 out of pocket.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
LVs policy terms included the following definition of market value:
the cost of replacing your car with the same make, model and specification. Age, 
mileage and condition will be taken into account. Well ask an engineer for advice, 
use motor trade guides and other sources to determine the market value. Well 
consider the amount you could have reasonably got for your car if you sold it 
immediately before the accident, loss or theft and not the price you paid for it
We expect an insurer to assess the market value of a car by reference to the retail figures in 
certain trade guides. We find these figures persuasive because they are based on extensive 
research of likely selling prices. The trade guide figures take into account the known features 
of each vehicle such as its specification. The guides make adjustments for recorded mileage 
and condition.
We will look at all relevant evidence. That includes any vehicle assessors expert report, 
which can be particularly useful for a car that isnt a standard model.
Compared to the trade guides, we usually find advertisements less persuasive. That is 
because an advertisement usually contains the sellers asking price that may be subject to 
negotiation downwards.
Typically, each of the trade guides provides a different figure so that they form a range. 
Where one of the figures is significantly out of line with the others, we may disregard it as an 
outlier. Subject to that, we often say that any figure within the range is a reasonable figure.
Ive noted the make, model, age, specification, mileage and condition of Mr Rs car. For a 
car like that in August 2022, Ive seen retail figures in the trade guides we use as follows:
 Glasss £3,380.00 
CAP £4,153.00
Percayso  £4,562.00 
Auto Trader £4,562.00
I regard the Glasss figure as out of line with the others. So I will disregard it.
Mr R has highlighted a single advertisement with an asking price of £5,695.00. However, a 
single advertisement or transaction isnt enough to persuade me that the trade guide figures 
are unfair.
Mr R and his expert havent provided enough evidence of any features of his car that the 
trade guides havent taken into account.Mr R hasnt provided enough direct evidence from dealers he spoke to in 2022 or enough 
detail of discussions to persuade me that the trade guide figures are unfair.
The crux of Mr Rs experts report is as follows:
2.7 One of the examples listed for £6,295 is a 59 plate rather than a 58 plate (both 
vehicles being registered in 2009), however this slight benefit is easily negated due 
to the vehicle having had six previous owners rather than yours, which only had two. 
Another vehicle is listed at £5,995, but has covered less mileage than yours, so in my 
professional opinion would be worth slightly more. The last vehicle is listed at £4,999 
and again is a 59 rather than a 58. However, again the number of owners negates 
the latter. The mean value of these vehicles is £5,763; thus, this is what I believe 
your vehicle to be worth. 
So the experts valuation of £5,763.00 is based on three advertisements, each containing an 
asking price. From what Ive seen, the advertisements date from July 2023.
So  in looking at LVs valuation in August 2022 - I find it fair and reasonable to place more 
weight on the retail figures in the CAP, Percayso and Auto Trader guides. LVs figure of 
£4,350.00 was within the range of those figures. So I dont conclude that it was an 
unreasonable or unfair market value. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct LV to 
increase its valuation or to pay any more to Mr R.
From LVs file, Ive seen that it said it shouldve paid the £4,000.00 on 13 August 2022 (the 
date of the accident) but it didnt make payment until later in August 2022. I dont condone 
that, and I dont doubt that Mr R was disappointed and anxious to get the money. So I  
consider that LV was right to pay compensation. 
However, LV paid a fair figure reasonably promptly. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to 
direct LV to pay interest and Im satisfied that £100.00 was fair and reasonable 
compensation for distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Limited to do any more in response to this 
complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2023.
