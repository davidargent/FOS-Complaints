At the time of writing this decision, loans 9 to 12 were outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few loans with Sunny and seemed to be dependent on this type of loan. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ds complaint from 
loan 7 onwards. This offer was put to Mr D, but he declined it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided - and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when it approved loans 1, 2 and 3.  Mr 
D didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about 
these loans, I wont be making any findings on them.Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr D and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Ds fourth loan in two months, I think Sunny 
should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Ds finances before lending him 
this loan. 
As our adjudicator explained  had Sunny carried out proportionate checks at the time Mr D 
applied for loan 4  it would have seen that Mr D was spending in excess of his monthly 
income on on-line gambling websites and was clearly having problems because of that. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think that this point was reached by loan 8. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr D was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr D had taken out eight loans within seven months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
From loan 8 onwards Mr D was provided with a new loan within weeks of taking out a 
previous one. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 
was taken out 11 months after his first. Mr D had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 8 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding loans 4 to 12 and Sunny should put things right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr D towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by Mr D 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr D as though they had been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr D having made 
overpayments then Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr D. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr D. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) Sunny should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ds credit file in relation to 
loans 4 to 7. The overall pattern of Mr Ds borrowing for loans 8 to 12 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Mr Ds 
credit file. Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ds credit file until 
these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2020.
