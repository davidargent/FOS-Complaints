K821x#15complaint
Ms S complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) was wrong to 
agree to lend to her.
background
Ms S out 21 instalment  loans with Sunny between July 2014  and December 2015.  The loan 
amounts varied  from £100 to £600  and were usually repayable  by six equal monthly 
instalments. Ive included  some of the loan information as an appendix at the end of this 
decision.
Ms S wants Sunny to pay her compensation and remove the mis-sold loans from her credit  
file.
The adjudicator recommended that Ms Ss complaint should be upheld  in part. He asked 
Sunny to refund the interest and charges that Ms S had paid on loans six to 21. The 
adjudicator also recommended  that Sunny remove loans six to 21 entirely from Ms Ss credit 
file. 
Sunny asked for some further information  which the adjudicator provided.  Sunny didnt 
respond to the adjudicators second assessment  so the complaint came  to me.
As there hadnt  been any dispute about  loans one to five, my decision originally dealt with 
the loans that remained  in dispute  loans six to 21. However Sunny has today confirmed  
that it accepts the adjudicators recommendation in relation  to loans six to 21.
As my decision was already ready, I have amended it slightly to reflect  Sunnys late 
agreement to the adjudicators recommendation.  But Ive still included my explanation of 
why I agreed with the adjudicator that loans six to 21 should be upheld.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending  was sustainable 
for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN54399332the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Source Book defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments.  
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ss complaint.
loans six to 21
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans six to 21 because I 
dont think that its necessary  for me to do so. Instead, Ive looked  at the overall pattern  of 
Sunnys lending history  with Ms S to see if there  was a point at which  Sunny shouldve  
reasonably seen Ms S was persistently reliant  on short term loans. So that further lending 
was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ss case, I think  this point was reached by loan six. 
I say this because:
loan six was the sixth loan that Ms S had taken out in eight months.  Ms S applied  for 
the loan on the same day that she repaid loan five. Loan  six was the third loan taken 
in the same month and loan four remained open. I think  Ms Ss loan history was in 
itself a demonstration of her inability to settle her loans over the life of the credit 
agreement.
Ms S continued to borrow  more money  while  earlier loans were still running, 
sometimes having three loans open  at the same time. So Sunny shouldve realised 
that it was more likely than not Ms S was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
left by the repayment of her previous loans.
Ref: DRN54399333Ms S wasnt making any real inroads in to the amount that she owed to Sunny. She 
was borrowing while she still owed money to Sunny, and when she repaid loans, 
applied for more money. I think  that this pattern of borrowing  shouldve alerted Sunny 
to the likelihood that Ms S wasnt  using  the loans as intended   for one off expenses. 
And that instead,  Ms S was borrowing money for everyday living costs.
 
I think that Ms S lost out because Sunny  provided loans six to 21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the extended period of time she owed Sunny money was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ss ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Overall, I consider its fair to uphold Ms Ss complaint  about  loans six to 21 on the basis that 
Sunny shouldve seen these loans  were unsustainable. 
As Ive already  said  Sunny now agrees to put things right so there is no longer any dispute 
over my final decision.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges that Ms S paid on loans six to 21;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan six means that any information  about loans 
six to 21 is negative. So all entries about loans six to 21 should be removed from Ms Ss 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ss complaint in part and direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 August 2019.
