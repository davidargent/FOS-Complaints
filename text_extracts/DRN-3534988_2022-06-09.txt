The complaint
Mr Z has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) continued to allow him
to place gambling transactions after he asked it to put a gambling block on is account.
What happened
Mr Z called NatWest on 11 December 2020 to notify it that he had a gambling problem and 
to see if it could put a block on his account and assist him in raising a chargeback dispute 
against a gambling retailer , which I will refer to as B, to help him reclaim his lost funds. Mr 
Z explained that seven years ago it had contacted B and advised it that he had a gambling 
problem. Since then he hadnt placed any bets with B. But during the pandemic Mr Z, tried to 
place a bet with B and the transactions were authorised. As such, Mr Z wanted to raise a 
charge back dispute, as he felt that B shouldnt have allowed him to place any bets due to it 
being aware of his gambling addiction.
During the call with NatWest on 11 December 2020 Mr Z was advised that he could contact 
the disputes team who would try and get Mr Zs money back by raising a chargeback, but it 
couldnt guarantee this would be successful. The advisor also said she could refer Mr Z to an 
account protection manager (who would assist him with his specific circumstances) and 
suggested he also speak to collections as his account was operating outside his agreed 
overdraft limit. She also offered Mr Z support by referring him to another adjudication 
service.
Mr Z called NatWest on 14 December 2020 to try and raise a dispute and was told NatWest 
would submit a debit card dispute. The advisor explained that if the retailer says they were 
not notified or made aware of Mr Zs gambling issues, the dispute wouldnt be successful. 
The advisor told Mr Z he could go to the online application and put a block on the account 
via manage my card. He was also advised that retail disputes could put a block on the 
account for him. The advisor then went on to assist Mr Z and helped him select the correct 
option for him to raise a dispute.
On 15 December 2020 Mr Z spoke to NatWest again, during this call he was told a dispute 
couldnt be raised as gambling transactions fell outside of the chargeback rules and NatWest 
did not have a chargeback right against these. Therefore, these transactions would not be 
able to be disputed.
Mr Z contacted NatWest on 30 December 2020, again to discuss his gambling addiction and 
to discuss further payments for gambling retailers that have been authorised, despite him 
being under the impression a block was on his account. Mr Z specifically mentions retailer 
V. Mr Z is told a dispute cant be raised due to it being gambling transactions which he 
authorised and reminds him that when the stop was put on his account, he was told that it 
was not guaranteed. Mr Z remained unhappy and was very confused as to why gambling 
transactions were still being authorised. So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked into Mr Zs concerns and issued its final response on 19 January 2021. 
NatWest said it hadnt found any error in the efforts it made to try and assist Mr Z. It 
confirmed that when a block against gambling retailers is put on an account it is only an 
attempt to prevent any further payments from being taken and is not guaranteed to block all 
types of gambling payments from leaving the account. NatWest confirmed this information 
was sent to Mr Z in an email.
Mr Z remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked 
into the complaint and felt that the service Mr Z had received was not satisfactory. She said 
that she felt NatWest could have done more to help Mr Z. As such she said that NatWest 
should pay Mr Z £250 for the distress it had caused him. NatWest accepted the 
investigators findings. But Mr Z didnt, as such the case was referred to me to consider.
I issued my provisional findings on 9 May 2022, which said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have listened to all the call recordings provided by NatWest (however, I am minded that not 
all calls that took place were available). I have also considered all correspondence sent to 
Mr Z, questions our service asked NatWest and NatWests policy.
Having listened to Mr Zs first call to NatWest on 11 December 2020. I am satisfied at this 
stage Mr Z explains he is vulnerable, has a gambling addiction and it is clear he is asking the 
bank for help. While support was offered in regards to referring Mr Z to an account protection 
manager and the collections team, I cant hear that the option to have a stop request put on 
the account to stop further transactions from taking place (compounding Mr Zs vulnerability) 
was discussed. 
It is disappointing that this wasnt discussed during this call. The FCAs guidance for firms on 
the fair treatment of vulnerable consumers makes it clear that front end staff should be able 
to identify vulnerability and ensure consumers are being treated fairly. And I am not satisfied 
in this call this happened. Mr Z should have been made aware at this point that a block stop 
request could be put on his account and an explanation of what that meant for Mr Z should 
have been provided.
On the call which took place on 14 December 2020, I can see that Mr Z was made aware 
about the possibility of putting a stop on the account and its important to note that Mr Z 
initiated this call). However, despite there being a further call (on 15 December 2022) where 
Mr Z again discusses his addiction, it appears, from the evidence provided by NatWest that 
a stop wasnt put on the account until 20 days after Mr Z made NatWest aware. Our service 
asked NatWest the following:
I can't see any notes confirming when this stop was activated.
NatWest responded by email and said:
The first stop was placed on 31 Dec 2020
NatWest had provided evidence to show that when a stop is put on an account for a 
customer, they are sent the following disclaimer:
Thank you for contacting us. We have placed a stop request against online gambling 
transactions on your debit card; this can take up to 3 working days to be active. This is not a 
guaranteed stop or block and will remain active on your account for 6 months. If any further 
online gambling transactions debit the account, the bank would not be in a position to 
dispute or refund the payments.Having reviewed Mr Zs account statements, I can see several gambling transactions took 
place between 11 December 2020 and 31 December 2020. It is unclear why it took NatWest 
20 days to put a stop on Mr Zs account, especially considering Mr Z (in the call he made to 
NatWest on 30 December 2021) was under the impression a stop had been put on his 
account. And while I cant be certain that these transactions would have been stopped if the 
block had been put on sooner (due to the disclaimer issued by NatWest) it is evident, 
NatWest didnt act promptly or in the interest of a vulnerable consumer in this instance.
I have also gone on to consider the nature of the call Mr Z had with NatWest on 30 
December 2020. As outlined above, by NatWests own admission, the stop wasnt on the 
account, so when Mr Z rang to query why gambling transactions to V had been authorised, 
he should have been told at that point the stop wasnt on his account. Instead, the stop was 
actioned a day later, after Mr Z had raised a complaint.
During that conversation NatWest explained that a stop was only applied to merchant codes,
it couldnt possibly apply a stop to merchant names due to the numerous IDs merchants 
could trade under. However, it appears, NatWest was saying, it is more affective to apply a 
block to merchant codes opposed to Merchant names, as NatWest went onto eventually 
apply blocks to several merchant names in April 2021.
With that in mind, given the fact that Mr Z had specifically mentioned retailer V during the call 
he made with NatWest on 30 December 2021, and the multiple transactions he had placed 
with retailer V, since making NatWest aware of his issue on 11 December 2020, I think it 
would have been reasonable at that point for NatWest to have placed a block on Merchant 
V, as it went on to do so in April 2021. I say this because, NatWest were made aware of that 
retailer as Mr Z had mentioned it several times during the call. And it appears it had the 
power to specifically block that Merchant name. Also, NatWest agrees it should have taken 
this action sooner from reviewing the correspondence it provided to our service.
As such, I am not satisfied Mr Z has been treated fairly as a vulnerable consumer. NatWest 
didnt suggest putting a stop on the account at the first instance, delayed applying the stop 
when Mr Z requested it and delayed blocking retailer V.
In order to put things right NatWest should:
Refund all gambling transactions in regards to retailer V from 11 December to 30 
April 2021. NatWest should deduct any winnings made from the bets placed to 
retailer V.
NatWest should pay Mr Z £350 for the distress and inconvenience it has caused by 
not treating Mr Z as a vulnerable consumer and putting the appropriate measures in 
place.
NatWest agreed with my provisional findings. However, Mr Z remained unhappy. He said he 
believes all gambling transactions from 2020 should be refunded as he had made NatWest 
aware of his gambling addiction on several occasions and they continued to let him trade. As 
such he holds them account and feels all gambling transactions should be refunded. He also 
said that he didnt agree that NatWest should refund gambling transactions in regard to 
retailer V from 11 December 2020 to April 2021, as there were no further transactions and 
therefore there would be nothing to refund.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Z has left two voicemails on 17 May 2022 with his comments for my consideration, as 
well as two phone calls with our investigator after the provisional findings were issued. I 
understand he is very concerned I havent considered or listened to his points. As explained 
above, I have considered all available evidence and arguments, including listening to his 
voicemails and calls with the investigator.
However, having done so, it hasnt changed my findings. I will explain why. 
Mr Z has said that NatWest should refund all the gambling transactions he made in 2020, as 
he had made them aware of his gambling addiction on several occasions. Having listened to 
Mr Zs call on 11 December 2020, I can see that Mr Z had said he notified a gambling 
retailer B about his gambling issues and asked them to close his complaint. It appears from 
listening to the call, that this was the first time he notified NatWest about his gambling 
issues. While I did hear Mr Z say he had notified all gambling retailers he had previously 
placed bets with there was no mention of him previously mentioning it to NatWest. And this 
is consistent with NatWests contact notes. So, while I dont dispute Mr Zs recollection of 
events, I am persuaded that this was the first time he had made NatWest aware of his 
gambling issues. As such, I cant hold NatWest responsible for the transactions placed prior 
to 11 December 2020.
As I mentioned in my provisional findings, it took NatWest 20 days from when it became 
aware of Mr Zs issues to put a stop on his account. However, even if the stop had been 
placed on the 11 December 2020 (as it should have) I cant be certain that all gambling 
transactions would have been blocked. I say this because, when a block is put on the 
account, NatWest send this disclaimer to its customers:
Thank you for contacting us. We have placed a stop request against online gambling 
transactions on your debit card; this can take up to 3 working days to be active. This is not a 
guaranteed stop or block and will remain active on your account for 6 months. If any further 
online gambling transactions debit the account, the bank would not be in a position to 
dispute or refund the payments.
So, while a block could have been put on the account on 11 December 2020, NatWests  
disclaimer explains it isnt a guarantee because a stop can only be applied to merchant 
codes, it couldnt possibly apply a stop to merchant names due to the numerous IDs 
merchants could trade under. Which I understand and cant say is unreasonable. So even if 
the stop had been applied sooner, its probable, that if Mr Z continued gambling (as he did) 
not all transactions would have been stopped.
However, NatWest did eventually apply blocks to several merchant names in April 2021. 
Highlighting it was possible to block these specific retailers once it was made aware of their 
trading names. So given the fact that Mr Z had specifically mentioned retailer V during the 
call he made with NatWest on 30 December 2020, and the multiple transactions he had 
placed with retailer V, since making NatWest aware of his issue on 11 December 2020, I 
think it would have been reasonable at that point for NatWest to have placed a block on 
Merchant V. And it went on to do so in April 2021. But its not reasonable to ask NatWest to 
refund transactions prior to it being made aware of Mr Zs gambling issues, or for 
transactions which would have still proceeded regardless of the block due to the merchants 
ID.
Mr Z has said there were no further gambling transactions after 11 December 2020, so this 
decision isnt beneficial to him. But I dont agree. I have reviewed his statements and I can 
see several gambling transactions to retailer V on 29 December 2020 and 4 January 2021.Therefore, for the reasons I have explained above my decision remains the same as I 
highlighted in my provisional findings.
Putting things right
In order to put things right NatWest should:
Refund all gambling transactions in regards to retailer V from 11 December to 30 
April 2021. NatWest should deduct any winnings made from the bets placed to 
retailer V.
NatWest should pay Mr Z £350 for the distress and inconvenience it has caused by 
not treating Mr Z as a vulnerable consumer and putting the appropriate measures in 
place.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Zs complaint and require National Westminster Bank 
Plc to compensate Mr Z as I have outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
