K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains about the advice he was given by Highland Financial Services  Ltd 
(Highland) in 2009.
background
In 2009 Mr B was advised by Highland to transfer his two existing paid up pension plans into 
a new personal  pension plan (PPP) with a new provider (although  the existing and the new 
providers are now all part of the same company). Mr B was also advised  to start making 
contributions of £125 a month.  
Mr B complained in 2017 through a claims management company (CMC)  that: 
He was advised to cancel his original pension policies in favour of a new one.
He wasnt offered the option of a stakeholder  plan (SHP).
The adviser took advantage of him by selling more than one policy,  which  may have
led to lower overall performance.
His attitude to risk wasnt assessed properly and didnt match  the pension  which  was 
recommended.
He was misled when advised  to transfer  his pension as the PPP hasnt performed as 
he was led to believe and the charges mean hes actually lost money.
He wasnt told about the charges hed pay to the financial adviser for transferring
his pension.
Mr Bs representative has highlighted that the PPP was mis-sold;  Mr Bs existing policy had 
guaranteed annuity rates  (GARs) that were lost on transfer; the PPP wasnt in Mr Bs best 
interests; the commission was high;  and the advice was inappropriate.
Highland didnt uphold  the complaint. It also said Mr B had complained too late. 
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators.  He issued his detailed view on 
21 July 2018.  In summary he said:
the complaint  had been made within the relevant time limits;
the advice  to transfer away  from policy  *****73 was unsuitable;
the advice  to transfer policy *****15  into a PPP rather  than a SHP was
inappropriate;
the advice  to make regular contributions  into a PPP rather  than a SHP was
inappropriate.
The adjudicator upheld the complaint and set out how Highland  should  quantify and pay 
redress to Mr B.  
Highland didnt accept  that Mr Bs complaint  had been made in time. One of my ombudsman  
colleagues considered if Mr Bs complaint  had been  made too late. My colleague issued a 
jurisdiction decision on 22 July 2019.  Mr B had complained through a claims management  
company (CMC) in June  2017. That was outside the primary six year period. So the 
complaint would only be in time if it was made within three years of when  Mr B became 
aware (or reasonably  ought to have become aware) he had cause for complaint. My 
colleague said that Mr B had only become aware he had cause for complaint after hed 
Ref: DRN23345652contacted the CMC.  As the complaint had been  made within three  years  of then it had been 
made in time. 
The complaint has now been passed to me for a decision  on the merits, that is whether the 
complaint should  be upheld  and, if so, what redress should be paid to Mr B. 
my findings
Were required to keep jurisdiction under review throughout our investigation of a complaint. 
I concur with the decision issued  by my colleague.  In my view Mr Bs complaint hasnt been 
made too late  it was made within three years of when he became aware (or reasonably  
ought to have become aware) he had cause for complaint. 
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusions as the adjudicator and for the same reasons.  Ive recapped  here some of what  
he said. 
As the adjudicator identified, there are several  strands to Mr Bs complaint: the transfer from 
policy *****73 to the PPP;  the transfer of monies from policy  *****15  into the PPP;  and the 
advice to make regular contributions into the PPP. 
Looking first the transfer from policy *****73,  the transfer value was £8,879.40. The fund was 
invested in a with-profits fund and couldnt  be switched. The annual management charge 
was no more than 1% of the fund each year. No annual bonuses had been added  since 
2004. The policy was written to provide a guaranteed cash  fund at the selected retirement 
date provided that contributions continued until then. The policy had a GAR at age 65 of 8% 
for a single life level annuity, with payments monthly in advance  and with a five year 
guarantee period. 
In May 2009  the annuity rate (on the basis that Mr B didnt qualify for an enhanced annuity 
rate) offered by a market leading provider for a comparable annuity was about  6.7%.  The 
GAR (which would be lost on transfer) at age 65 on policy *****73 was around 19.4% more. 
Highland should  have recognised the GAR was valuable. At the time of the advice Mr B was 
coming up to age 61. The level of return needed during the remaining term (less than four 
and a half years)  to provide equivalent  benefits  would  involve  taking a higher level of risk 
than Mr B was prepared, or should have been advised, to take.  Highland  should have 
realised that Mr B was likely to be worse  off in retirement by transferring and should have 
advised him to retain policy *****73.
Looking now at the transfer of policy *****15, that policy didnt have any GARs.  But it was 
written to provide  a basic guaranteed basic annuity at Mr Bs normal retirement date, 
provided his contributions continued until then. But that didnt happen   the policy was made 
paid up in July 1989. There were concerns about  performance but fund switches werent 
permitted. I dont think a recommendation  that Mr B transfer to an alternative pension 
arrangement was inherently unsuitable. 
And I dont  think it was unsuitable to recommend that Mr B make  additional  pension  
contributions. He couldnt make new contributions into either of his existing policies  so hed 
need to set a new plan anyway. 
Ref: DRN23345653Highland was obliged  to consider a SHP and explain, if a PPP was recommended  instead,  
why it was at least as suitable  as a SHP. Highlands report  dated  7 May 2009 said it didnt 
consider a SHP to be suitable as a SHP had management charges of 1.5% a year, as 
opposed to 0.7% a year for the PPP it was recommending. As the adjudicator  explained, at 
the time,  charges for SHPs were capped at 1.5%  a year for the first ten years. But some 
SHPs charged less. 
And Highlands commission  for the advice wasnt clearly explained. The short  time frame  
was relevant here. The adjudicator looked  at the total contributions Mr B would have made  
until he reached age 65 and the commission that would have been  deducted   some 
17.65%. That wouldnt have been permitted with a SHP as the maximum charge of 1.5%  a 
year covered  the annual management  charge and any advisory commissions.  The PPP 
would have to significantly outperform  the SHP to provide equivalent benefits.
Similar reasoning applied to the sum transferred from policy *****15: the commission  costs  
plus the annual  management charge meant the charging structure was greater than for a 
SHP. That hadnt  been made clear to Mr B. Highlands reasons for recommending  a PPP 
and not a SHP werent justified. Nor was a PPP warranted on other grounds,  such as fund 
choice.
All in all suitable advice would have  been that Mr B retain policy *****73; transfer policy  
*****15 to a SHP and make regular contributions to the SHP.  The adjudicator set out how 
Highland should  redress Mr B, including the assumptions hed made. Highland  queried  one 
aspect of the redress. It said the provider couldnt calculate a notional value for the PPP 
using different charges. The adjudicator responded and suggested a different basis for that 
part of the calculation. 
Im satisfied what the adjudicator suggested  is fair and reasonable. Ive adopted his redress  
here. But, as we now know (D) mentioned  below isnt available, Ive included  the alternative  
calculation basis suggested  by the adjudicator and which should be used instead.  
fair compensation 
HFSL should do the following:
1)  The transfer from policy *****73 into the PPP
Ask the provider for a notional  valuation  of what policy *****73 would currently  have been 
worth (the date the provider uses for this notional valuation will be referred  to as the date of 
calculation), had monies  been retained  in it to date. I will term the notional  sum (X).
The GAR on policy *****73 was 8%. Ascertain the open market annuity rate that would be 
available to Mr B as at the date of calculation.  The annuity is to be on as similar a basis as is 
possible to that which would have been  provided had the GAR been exercised. The open 
market rate in percentile terms will be termed (Y).  8% divided  by (Y) = (Z). So, by way of 
example, if (Y) were  6% then (Z) would be 1.33.
Multiply (X) by (Z). The resulting sum will be termed (A). (A) represents  the notional  value of 
policy *****73 as at the date of calculation uplifted to allow for the value of the GAR which 
was forfeited on transfer.
Ref: DRN23345654Ascertain what the PPP would be worth, as at the date of calculation,  if the only monies 
invested in it from outset had been  the monies transferred in from policy  *****73 (in other 
words ascertain what proportion of the actual value  of the PPP as at the date of calculation 
is attributable to the monies transferred in from policy  *****73). The value arrived at is (B).
(A)  (B) = (C). If (C) is above £0 then the unsuitable advice to transfer away  from policy 
*****73 has given  rise to a financial loss. If (C) is less than £0 then Mr B is financially better 
off notwithstanding  the unsuitability of that advice. Any loss or gain from this step will be 
amalgamated with any loss or gain from step 2) below to arrive at a total end redress  figure.
2) The transfer from policy *****15 into the PPP and the recommendation to pay regular  
contributions into the PPP
The adjudicator suggested, assuming an identical gross of charges return  to that which  has 
actually occurred, ascertain what the PPP would be worth, as at the date of calculation,  if:
the only monies invested in it from outset had been the monies transferred
in from policy *****15 and the regular  contributions;
the only charges  those monies had suffered from outset (including advisory charges) 
had amounted to total charges 1.5%  a year.
The value arrived at will be termed (D). But, as Ive noted above,  it appears the provider  
cant calculate (D). To enable Highland to calculate (D) the provider should  be asked instead 
to:
Assuming an identical gross of charges return to that which  has actually occurred, ascertain 
what the PPP would be worth, as at the date of the calculation,  if:
the only monies invested in it from outset had been the monies transferred in from 
policy *****15 and the regular contributions (and assuming no deduction for initial or 
ongoing advisory charges);
the underlying  plan/fund charges were the same  as has actually been  the case (and 
clarification on the exact charging structure should be provided);
The provider should also be asked  for an end of year notional valuation  for every year from 
inception up to date.  From those Highland will be able to extrapolate  the annual  growth  rate 
for year one premised on charges of x% (the total annual charging structure which the 
provider identifies) and from that manually calculate  a reasonable approximation of what  the 
end of year figure would have been  for year one had the total charges applicable to the 
monies in question been 1.5% rather than x%. Growth figures  for each of the subsequent  
years from the figures and what they would have  been had the charges been 1.5% rather  
than x% can then be worked  out. Highland can then calculate  manually  (D) which is what the 
PPP would be worth, as at the date of calculation, if:
the only monies invested from outset had been  the monies transferred in from policy 
*****15 and the regular  contributions;
the only charges  those monies had suffered from outset (including advisory charges) 
had amounted to total charges of 1.5% a year.
Ascertain what proportion  of the actual value  of the PPP as at the date of calculation is not 
attributable to the monies transferred in from policy *****73. The value arrived at is (E).
Ref: DRN23345655(D)  (E) = (F). If (F) is above £0 then the advice to pay the regular contributions and policy  
*****15 monies into the PPP rather  than a SHP has given rise to a financial loss. If (F) is less 
than £0 then Mr B is financially better  off notwithstanding the unsuitability  of that advice. Any 
loss or gain from step will be amalgamated  with any loss or gain from step 1) above to arrive 
at a total end redress  figure.
3) (C) + (F) = (G)
If (G) is less than £0 then the advice has given rise to an overall gain and there is nothing 
further for Highland  to do; the gain should  be considered  to be adequate redress for the 
distress and inconvenience Mr B has suffered as a result of the unsuitable advice.
If (G) is more than £0 then the unsuitable advice  has given rise to an overall financial loss 
and Highland  should make good this loss.
To do this Highland should arrange for an existing pension arrangement Mr B has to be 
augmented by the value of (G) plus interest (at 8% simple from the date of calculation 
through until the date of payment). Mr B should be aware tax may be due on the interest 
element. Any payment  Highland makes to achieve this should  take account  of any available 
tax relief and the effect of charges.
Alternatively, if it is not possible to pay the monies  owing into a suitable pension  
arrangement, or if doing so would give rise to any pension protection  or annual allowance  
issues, then Highland  should instead  pay the money  owing as a cash  sum directly to Mr B. 
But had it been  possible to pay it into a pension plan then it would have  provided  a taxable 
income in retirement.  So the total amount should be reduced to notionally  allow  for any 
income tax that would otherwise have  been paid. 
The notional allowance should  be calculated using Mr Bs likely marginal rate of tax in 
retirement. For example,  if he is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer in retirement, the notional 
allowance would equate to a reduction in the total amount equivalent to the current  basic  
rate of tax. However, if Mr B would  have been able to take a tax-free lump sum, the notional  
allowance should  only be applied to 75% of the total amount.
Pay Mr B £200 directly (and with no deduction  for tax) for distress and inconvenience.
Provide details of its calculations to Mr B in a clear and simple format. 
my final decision
I uphold the complaint. Highland  Financial Services Ltd must redress  Mr B as Ive set out. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 September 2020.
