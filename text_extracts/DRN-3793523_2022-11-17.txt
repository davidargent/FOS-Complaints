The main point to note is that there is not a lot of financial information about many of these 
loans due to the age of them.
After Morses had issued its final response letter (FRL) in which it did not uphold Mr Vs 
complaint, it was referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service. One of our adjudicators 
looked at it and thought that the complaint ought not to be upheld.
Mr Vs representative has asked that it be reviewed by an ombudsman but has not sent to us 
any additional information to demonstrate Mr Vs financial situation. Morses has told us that 
Mr V went into a debt management programme in 2017 and the last loan forms part of an 
IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement). Morses has sent to us copies of the paper 
applications for those in 2016 and loan 6 was entered onto its front sheet which gave Mr Vs 
declared income as £350 and his outgoings as £150. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high cost, short-term and home 
credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website. Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mr V could afford to pay back the 
amounts shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks could have considered a number
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Vs 
income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish 
that any lending was sustainable for Mr V. These factors include:
Mr V having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr V having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr V coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr V. 
Morses was required to establish whether Mr V could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether he technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr V was able to repay his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Vs complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
We have no information from either Mr V or from Morses on the financial situation for Mr V in 
2013 and 2014. So, with no information I am not able to make any findings on the complaint 
for these two loans.
Loans 3 to 6
There was a significant break in the lending chain when Mr V applied for loan 3 and I think it 
reasonable that Morses was able to treat Mr V as a new customer due to that break which 
meant that relying on the information Mr V gave to Morses at the time was satisfactory and 
Id consider to have been proportionate checks. 
In the absence of information about Mr Vs financial situation for the lending period covering 
loans 3 to 6 then I have relied on the information I have received from Morses. The income 
and expenditure information I have got from the paper applications for loans 3 to 5 and the 
front sheet for loan 6 show me that Mr V was able to afford the weekly repayments. For Loan 3, which was for a relatively modest sum of £250 over a 33 week term, Mr Vs 
paper application shows me that he had said he earned £270 a week, he was single and his 
outgoings each week were £150 which included rent, utility bills and food/transport costs. 
So, the repayment of £12.50 each week would have appeared affordable. 
For Loan 4, Mr V said he earned £350 a week and his outgoings were £195. So, Loan 4 
would have looked affordable.
I do have a concern about loan 5 as it was applied for within a few weeks of taking loan 4. 
Mr V informed Morses that he earned £350 a week and his outgoings were £195 a week. 
And loan 5 would have been running concurrently with loan 4 which would have increased 
his repayments each week to Morses. But Ive no information from Mr V about his finances 
and so even if Morses had done some more checking as to why he wanted more credit so 
soon after taking loan 4, Ive no information to help me to assess that. 
Morses has not been able to send to us any credit search details and I am unclear whether a 
search of Mr Vs credit situation was carried out and Morses no longer has the files or none 
was carried out. But it was not a requirement for Morses to carry out a credit search before 
lending, and so the lack of it would not necessarily alter the outcome. 
I have seen a copy of the repayment records for Mr V and having reviewed them it does 
appear that Mr V may have had some difficulty repaying in the middle of loan 3. But without 
additional information on his financial situation in 2016 and 2017 I am not able to determine 
why or the reasons for it. 
I know that Mr Vs representative has raised the argument surrounding Morses having lent 
so often a harmful pattern of lending had developed. But I dont think that the second loan 
chain (loans 3 to 6) was a particularly long period such that a pattern had been established.  
Overall, and on the evidence I have, it seems that Mr V was able to afford the loans and I do 
not uphold Mr Vs complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Vs complaint.  Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or reject my decision before 
15 December 2022.
