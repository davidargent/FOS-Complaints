Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as they thought  the pattern of borrowing  indicated  
Miss B was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but has said it has removed all 
entries about loan 10 from Miss Bs file. As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally,  it 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN93889222the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 3. Miss B 
didnt respond  to the view. As there appears  to no longer be a dispute about these loans, I 
won be making further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out adequate checks before it lent loan 4 to Miss B. These  checks 
included verifying  what she had told Sunny about her income and outgoings. But as this was 
Miss Bs fourth loan in two months, I think Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer 
picture about Miss Bs finances before  lending  her this loan. 
I say this because  at the time of loan 4, Miss B still had two outstanding loans with Sunny. 
The combined repayments for all three of these loans was around £366 and Miss B would 
be repaying this from her monthly income of £1,375.  The repayment  represented  a 
significant proportion  of Miss Bs income and I think Sunny ought to have realised this and 
the potential for Miss B to struggle to make all the repayments. Given  Miss Bs income and 
borrowing, it seems there was a significant chance  of Miss B having to borrow  again to meet 
her commitments  under these loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
Ref: DRN93889223At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out six loans  in nearly five months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss B was having  to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Miss Bs first loan was for £250  and loan 6 was for £500.  At  this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that it was unlikely Miss B was borrowing to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in her income but more  to meet an ongoing  need.  
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 10 was 
taken out 10 months after Miss Bs first. Miss B had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 4 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about 4 and 5 from Miss Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 9 should be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file. I note Sunny has said it was already willing to remove  this 
information in relation  to loan 10. If it hasnt done this already then it should do so. 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must give Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 March 2020.
