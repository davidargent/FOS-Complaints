K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Casheuronet  UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about twenty-one payday loans and a running  account facility Quick  Quid 
provided to Mr L from March 2010 onwards.  Mr Ls last loan was provided in February  2016.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan seven 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Quick Quid disagreed with our adjudicators  view.  As the parties havent been able to agree 
on a resolution the complaint has been  passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to 
reasonably conclude Mr L could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks 
could take into account a number of different things, such  as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid was required to establish 
whether Mr L could repay his loans in a sustainable  manner. And I think that this is wider 
than simply assessing  whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation.  Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an 
Ref: DRN15179112indication a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt  automatically 
follow this is the case. 
This is because the relevant rules and guidance  defines in a sustainable manner as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular without incurring or increasing  problem  
indebtedness, over the life of the credit agreement and out of income and/or  available  
savings. So it follows that if a lender realises, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that 
a borrower is unlikely to be able be able to make their repayments in a sustainable manner if 
they have a history  of failing to settle  loans over the life of the credit agreement. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Quick Quids lending history with Mr L, I think that 
Quick Quid should  reasonably have  seen that Mr L was unlikely to have been able to make  
his loan repayments in a sustainable manner by the time it provided loan seven. I say this 
because:
By this stage, Mr L was into his ninth month  of owing  Quick Quid  money. In my view,  
Mr Ls pattern of borrowing up until this point was in itself a clear  demonstration  of  
Mr Ls inability to settle his loans over the life of the credit agreement. Mr Ls seventh 
loan was for the same amount of his first and hed already repaid significantly more  
than what he was lent in interest fees and charges.   
Mr L continued to be provided with new loans  shortly after having repaid previous 
ones. So Quick  Quid ought to have realised  it was more likely  than not Mr L was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in 
his finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr L was provided with loans for a period of over five years.  I accept that some of the 
loans were for small amounts. But Mr L wasnt making any real inroads into what he 
owed Quick Quid and his indebtedness  was being prolonged for an extended  period  
of time. Loan twenty-one was provided almost  six years  after Mr Ls first. This 
approaching six year period cant in any reasonable circumstances be described  as 
short-term and this meant that Mr L paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Quick  Quid  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Quick Quid continued to provide borrowing from loan seven 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the extended period of time Mr L owed Quick Quid money was likely to have  had 
negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans seven  to twenty-one (including the running 
account facility) and Quick Quid should  put things right.
putting things right  what Quick Quid  needs to do
Ref: DRN15179113refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans seven to twenty-one (including the 
running account (flex-credit) facility);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the period  of time Mr L owed Quick  Quid money means that any information still 
recorded about loans seven to twenty-one (including  the running account  (flex-credit) 
facility) is adverse.  So all entries  about loans seven  to twenty-one  (where  they 
remain) should be removed from Mr Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick Quid 
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Casheuronet  UK LLC 
(trading as Quick  Quid) should pay Mr L compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2019.
