K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs F complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc switched their statement delivery 
preference from paper to online. Mr and Mrs F are concerned that NatWest has lied about 
why it took that step. 
background 
Mr and Mrs F have  a joint account with NatWest.  On 13 October  2018  NatWest wrote to 
Mr and Mrs F and said A joint account holder has asked  us to stop sending out paper 
statements and pre-advices of interest and charges which apply  to this account. This means  
that you will no longer  receive these  by post,  however,  you will be able to view them  online. 
But Mr and Mrs F say neither of them asked  NatWest to do that and they complained. 
NatWest responded  on 19 October 2018  and confirmed it had written to a number of 
customers incorrectly saying that an account  holder had asked for their delivery preference 
to be changed.  NatWest apologised, arranged for paper statement delivery to resume  and 
paid £25.40 to cover Mr and Mrs Fs costs and inconvenience. 
However, NatWest advised  that the reason Mr and Mrs Fs delivery preferences had been 
amended was because itd decided  to change the way it communicates with customers.  
Mr and Mrs F referred their complaint to this service  and an adjudicator  looked at it. He 
asked NatWest to increase the award to £50 which it agreed to do. But Mr and Mrs F dont 
feel NatWests offer is fair and remain upset and concerned  that theyve been lied to. 
Mr and Mrs F asked  to appeal their complaint so its been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has confirmed  that it made a mistake when it wrote to Mr and Mrs F to say one of 
them had asked  to change the communication preferences. NatWest has also told us that 
the error  wasnt an isolated incident  and that it sent the same letter  to other customers.  I 
know Mr and Mrs F feel theyve been lied to but I havent found any evidence thats the case.  
I appreciate why Mr and Mrs F complained  they didnt  ask to stop receiving paper 
statements  but Im satisfied the letter they received was a genuine error by NatWest. 
NatWest has explained  that it shouldve sent Mr and Mrs F a letter  advising that it was 
moving to issue paperless correspondence on their account because  of a decision it took 
about how to communicate with account holders. NatWest is free to decide  how it 
communicates with customers. 
Mr and Mrs F are concerned that their account preferences  may be changed again in the 
future and have asked  to NatWest to confirm its position every six months. But I wouldnt 
expect NatWest to take that step. 
Ive seen systems evidence to show Mr and Mrs Fs statements are being sent in the post. 
Ive got no reason to think Mr and Mrs Fs communication preferences will be changed  
again. But the account terms say NatWest will notify Mr and Mrs F of changes  to how the 
Ref: DRN78333702account operates before they come into effect. So if NatWest does decide to make  further 
changes in the future Mr and Mrs F will be given advance notice. 
Its clear that the issues has caused some upset for Mr and Mrs F and I agree that its 
appropriate that NatWest offers a fair settlement in this case. When  considering whether a 
business has offered  a fair settlement I have to look at the impact  on the consumer. 
In this case, Mr and Mrs F received NatWests letter shortly after 13 October  2018  to say 
their paper statements would stop. Mr and Mrs F spoke with NatWest  and complained  
around 18 October 2018 and it arranged for the delivery preference to be switched back. No 
statements appear to have been affected in the five day window and Mr and Mrs F continued 
to receive them in paper form. NatWest issued its final response explaining how everything  
had been resolved on 19 October 2018. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr and Mrs F but whilst  Ive considered everything theyve told us 
about how the issue affected  them, including their health concerns, I think the impact of the 
issue is fairly reflected  by the £50 NatWest  has agreed to pay. As Im satisfied the £50 
settlement NatWest has already agreed  to pay is fair in all the circumstances  Im not telling it 
to increase it or take any further action to resolve  this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr and Mrs F £50 less any settlement  already paid. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision  before  26 April 2019.
