The complaint
Mr P and Mr P complain that they relied on a valuation by National Westminster Bank Plc 
when buying business premises for their partnership, B. But more recent valuations are 
dramatically lower. They say this caused them a huge financial loss. 
What happened
Mr P and Mr P bought premises for their business in 2017. They said that when they made 
this purchase, they relied on a valuation carried out for secured business lending by 
NatWest. They borrowed some money, and used some family savings for the rest.
In 2021 they wanted to expand the business, so they asked NatWest for some additional 
lending. NatWest said they could get a much lower interest rate if the borrowing was secured 
on Bs business premises, but it would need a new valuation for that. And when NatWest got 
this valuation, it was much lower than the 2017 valuation. Mr P and Mr P said they had lost a 
very large amount of money, and they didnt think this valuation could be right. 
NatWest asked its valuers for a second opinion, and the value of the property did increase, 
which NatWest said was due to another property nearby selling for more than anticipated at 
auction. But it was still significantly lower than the valuation from 2017. 
Mr P and Mr P said this couldnt be right. A big chunk of their money had just vanished. They 
wanted NatWest to pay compensation for the business, or at least £65,000 plus extra fees, 
for all the stress and anxiety it had caused.
NatWest didnt think it had made a mistake. It said it had instructed professional valuers to 
look at the property, each time, and it relied on what those valuers said. It had challenged 
the first 2021 valuation, and that had then increased with the sale of a comparable property 
locally. The valuers who did this work would also consider any further evidence that Mr P 
and Mr P wanted to offer on value. But NatWest said it didnt decide on valuations itself. And 
it didnt think it was wrong to rely on the professional opinions it had commissioned. 
NatWest said it had already paid Mr P and Mr P back the £2,100 theyd been charged for the 
2021 valuation. It wouldnt do more than this. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that our service doesnt 
deal with complaints about what the valuers themselves have done. We can only look at 
what NatWest did. 
Our investigator said that NatWest had appointed firms with appropriate professional 
qualifications. He couldnt see anything in the 2017 report which should have caused 
NatWest to question the valuation.
Our investigator said that when Mr P and Mr P questioned the first 2021 valuation, NatWest 
went back to the valuation company. Our investigator was satisfied that NatWest had raised 
Mr P and Mr Ps concerns with the valuer fairly and sufficiently.
But our investigator said NatWest had no reason to doubt the valuations provided. Once 
NatWest appoints suitably qualified surveyors, its reasonable for NatWest then to rely on 
their professional expertise in accepting their valuations.
Our investigator noted that NatWest had refunded the fee for the 2021 valuation, and he 
didnt think it had to do more. 
Mr P replied, to say the partnership wanted someone else to look at this case. He thought 
they had a strong case. He said valuations do not just drop overnight.
Because Mr P and Mr P didnt agree with our investigator, this case was then passed to me 
for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
I think that the key point, in responding to the concerns that Mr P and Mr P have raised with 
our service, is exactly what our service can and cannot look at. 
We can look at complaints about NatWest, and the decisions it took. 
That means we can consider whether NatWest acted reasonably in its choice of valuers. 
And we can look at whether it then acted reasonably, when it relied on the reports it got.
But we dont have any powers to investigate what a valuer or surveyor does. So we wouldnt 
say here that any of the valuations NatWest got was just wrong. 
I think that might be what Mr P and Mr P really want here. But thats not something I can do. 
I have to restrict my comments to what NatWest did. 
NatWest isnt an expert on the value of commercial property. And it will be aware that 
commercial property prices are much more volatile than residential property prices. So its 
reasonable for NatWest to rely on expert reports to decide valuations.
I can see that in 2017 and in 2021, NatWest instructed valuers who are appropriately 
professionally qualified and members of the recognised professional body. And, as our 
investigator said, the people who actually carried out the valuations, each time, were also 
appropriately qualified. 
The valuation NatWest received in 2021 was much lower than the one it received in 2017. 
And like our investigator, I can see that NatWest raised the concerns Mr P and Mr P 
expressed, with the valuers. Those valuers did reconsider, and the valuation increased 
slightly, apparently due to a recent sale of a similar property in the local area. But the 
valuation was still considerably lower than that received in 2017. This has meant that theres 
not as much equity in the property as Mr P and Mr P thought, and NatWest could only offer 
them unsecured lending, at a higher rate. 
Ive explained that I cannot question the valuations themselves. Thats not something our 
service can look at. Ive considered what NatWest did when it received these valuations, and I dont think its 
been unreasonable or unfair. I cant see anything in the first valuation that makes me think 
NatWest should have questioned this at the time. And Mr P and Mr P havent mentioned 
anything like this. 
NatWest clearly had reason to question the second valuation, because it was so much 
lower. And I can see that it did that. But those valuers still didnt think the property was worth 
as much as the 2017 valuation had said. 
I know that Mr P and Mr P wont agree with me, but I dont think it was wrong for NatWest, 
having challenged the 2021 valuation and received a robust reply, to then rely on what 
experts had told it. I know NatWest then paid Mr P and Mr P back the valuation fee theyd 
paid in 2021. I dont think NatWest has to do more than this.
I understand that Mr P and Mr P also made business decisions on the basis of the 2017 
valuation, which theyre now very unhappy with. But Im sorry to have to tell them that I just 
dont think that NatWest is responsible for the core information that they based those 
decisions on. 
For these reasons, I dont think this complaint against NatWest should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
