K821x#15complaint
Mr D says Gain Credit  LLC (trading as Lending  Stream) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Lending Stream provided to Mr D between 
November 2013  and March 2014.  
I issued a provisional decision for the complaint on 16 January 2020. A copy is attached  at 
Appendix A and forms part of this final decision.
Mr D and Lending Stream responded to say that they agreed with my provisional  findings.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
In the absence of any further representations  from the parties, I dont see any reason to 
depart from the position set out in my provisional  decision.
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loan 1 and loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1, 4 and 5 from Mr Ds credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 8 should be removed from Mr Ds 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Mr D a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I direct Gain Credit  LLC (trading as 
Lending Stream)  to pay Mr D compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2020.

complaint
Mr D says Gain Credit  LLC (trading as Lending  Stream)  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about  eight  instalment loans  Lending Stream provided to Mr D between  November  
2013 and March  2014. Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:
Loan number Principal Start End Highest 
Repayment
1£100.00 27/11/2013 27/12/2013£54.00
2£720.00 13/12/2013 06/02/2014£388.80
3£50.00 28/12/2013 06/02/2014£27.00
4£350.00 12/01/2014 27/01/2014£189.00
5£480.00 11/02/2014 26/03/2014£259.00
6£150.00 14/03/2014 26/03/2014£81.00

8£50.00 21/03/2014 26/03/2014£27.00
Lending Stream accepted that loan 1 may not have been affordable for Mr D, and offered to refund 
the interest hed paid on that loan.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ds complaint  and thought  that in addition  to loan 1, loans 6 to 8 shouldnt 
have been given. Lending Stream agreed with the adjudicators  recommendation.
Mr D said he considered loans 4 and 5 shouldnt have been given  either. The complaint was passed  
to me for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr D could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
Ref: DRN08439343expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending  Stream should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Lending Stream  was required to establish  
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
Lending Stream accepts that loan 1 may not have been affordable for Mr D and its offered to refund  
interest on that loan. So I wont make any further findings about that borrowing.
Our adjudicator said he didnt think it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to provide loans 2 to 5 to 
Mr D. But he considered  it shouldnt  have arranged loans 6 to 8.
Mr D considers Lending  Stream shouldnt  have arranged  loans 4 and 5.
From what Ive seen, I dont think it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to arrange  loans 2 and 3 
for Mr D. The loans were arranged  during  the early part of the lending  relationship, and seem to have 
been affordable to Mr D. The loans were  repaid sooner than required by the loan agreements.
But by loan 4 Mr D had taken four loans in about six weeks. Loans 2 and 3 remained open when he 
took loan 4. Im satisfied that the combined repayments for loans 2, 3 and 4 when  loan 4 was 
arranged represented  a significant proportion of Mr Ds income.  So I think  it wouldve  been 
reasonable for Lending  Stream to realise  the Mr D was unlikely to be able to sustainably  repay  loan 4.
Loans 1 to 4 had been  repaid by the time Mr D arranged  loan 5. But loan 5 was Mr Ds fifth loan in 
just over two months,  and was for more than loan 4. In addition, all of loans  1 to 4 had been repaid 
sooner than required by the loan agreements. Loans 2 and 3 had been repaid a few days before Mr D 
took loan 5.
Ref: DRN08439344Keeping all of these  points in mind,  I think it wouldve  been reasonable for Lending Stream  to carry 
out more detailed checks of Mr Ds finances.  
I understand Lending  Stream  asked Mr D about his income and outgoings and checked his credit file. 
But I think it wouldve been reasonable for the business to verify what Mr D had told it about his 
income and outgoings. Had it done so, I think  Lending Stream  wouldve discovered Mr D was 
borrowing from three other short-term lenders  and had an extensive overdraft. I think  its likely  that by 
this point Lending Stream wouldve also become aware  of the extent of Mr Ds gambling spend.  And 
with that knowledge, I think it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream  to conclude that loan 5 
was unlikely to be sustainable for
Mr D.
So I dont think Lending  Stream  wouldve agreed loan 5.
The parties  are in agreement  that loan 6 to 8 shouldnt  have been  given. They also agree that in 
addition to a refund of interest for those loans,  all information  about them should be removed from Mr 
Ds credit file. 
I think  thats fair and reasonable, because by the time Mr D took loan 6 hed taken six loans in under 
four months. And the amounts he was borrowing  werent  decreasing significantly. The number of 
loans Mr D borrowed  was likely to have had negative implications on his ability to access  mainstream 
credit and so potentially kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans  4 and 5 and loans 6 to 8 and Lending Stream  should  put 
things right.
putting things  right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on loan 1 and loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans  1, 4 and 5 from Mr Ds credit file;
the number of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 8 should  be removed from Mr Ds credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending Stream 
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, my provisional  decision  is that I intend to partially  uphold Mr Ds 
complaint. I intend to direct  Gain  Credit  LLC (trading  as Lending Stream)  to pay Mr D compensation 
as set out above.
