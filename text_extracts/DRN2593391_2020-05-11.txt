K822xcomplaint
Mr O complained about a number  of loans he took out through  a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr O says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr O took out 17 loans from Sunny between  December 2014 and 
December 2016.  Ive enclosed a summary  of his borrowing, based  on the information it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in April 2020, comprehensively setting  
out why I thought the complaint should be partly  upheld from the point of loan number 7, 
rather than at loan 5, as our adjudicator  had recommended. I asked both parties  to provide 
any further submissions or information  to me within one month.  
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Mr O accepts my decision and Sunny 
hasnt sent me anything  which changes my provisional decision either. Theres therefore  no 
reason for me to change  the findings I previously set out. I uphold  this complaint in respect 
of loans 7 - 17, fully in line with my provisional decision.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr O, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 7 - 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 -17 should be completely 
removed from Mr Os credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr O a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partly uphold this complaint  and I direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr O the above compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 June  2020.

complaint
Mr O complained about a number of loans he took out through  a company called Elevate Credit  
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. Mr O says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial  problems.
To keep things simple  Ill refer mainly  to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Mr O took out 17 loans from Sunny  between December 2014  and December 2016.  
Ive enclosed a summary of his borrowing, based on the information it provided  to us. It can be found  
in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld from the 
point of loan number 5 onwards. Sunny  didnt agree with the adjudicators view although  it did make 
an alternative offer, which  wasnt  accepted by Mr O. Its therefore  come to me for an ombudsmans  
decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Mr Os complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Mr O could  repay the 
loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have  taken into account  a range  
of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total repayment amount and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point,  as in this case, where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.  So Sunny was required to establish  whether  
Mr O could sustainably repay the loans, not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN25933913Of course, the re-payments  being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  that Mr O could 
sustainably make  them.  But it doesnt automatically follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator said they thought  the complaint  about loan numbers 1 - 4 ought  not to be upheld. 
There seems  no real dispute  about this and I also agree.  I think  the financial checks  which Sunny 
most likely carried for loans 1 - 4 would have been quite basic ones but they were probably 
proportionate to the lending  thus far.
But our adjudicator said that by loan number 5, there were signs that Mr O was having problems 
managing money.  Ive thought very carefully  about this and looked  at the pattern of borrowing. Whilst 
I dont doubt that Mr O could have been having wider financial problems  when he took out loan 5, I 
havent been  with presented  with any evidence  to show this. I therefore think that even though Sunny 
may have failed to carry out certain enhanced checks, theres nothing to suggest  that this would  
have actually  made a difference. I think these types of check[s] would  have showed Sunny it was still 
alright to lend him loan number 5 and indeed, loan 6.
As well as there being no evidence  that Sunny would  have  or should  have  found evidence not to 
lend, I see that for loans  1  4 Mr O had paid these all off in full. Loan 5 then represented  a reduction  
in borrowing and a much reduced monthly outlay. And loan 6 was a further reduction and did seem, in 
my view, to [be] suggesting Mr O was getting  on top of his borrowing requirements. Given what Mr O 
had himself declared his income and expenditure to be, I think these  show he was indicating he could  
likely afford  both loans 5 and 6.
Ive also considered that what the adjudicator said about the loans being taken  out after one another. 
But in this particular case, this doesnt outweigh  what  Ive said above.  The evidence does point to the 
loans being affordable  without undue difficulties  up to the point of loan 6 inclusive.  I therefore  dont 
currently think  any of the first 6 loan complaints  should be upheld
However, I think from the point of loan 7 onwards  there was an emerging pattern of repeated lending  
becoming much clearer. By then,  hed been borrowing repeatedly and regularly  with Sunny for 6 
months and this pattern should have caused Sunny  to see that he wasnt  merely borrowing to deal 
with short-term cash-flow problems; he was borrowing regularly, to address  shortfalls in his income 
and to meet an ongoing need. Mr O was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term 
lending over a sustained period and the indebtedness  caused  by this type of borrowing was also 
harmful, in my view. 
Loans 7 and 8 showed  the amount being borrowed substantially rising  again and he was lent to a 
repeatedly after that until the end of the chain  when hed been lent to some 17 times in around 24 
months. So Im intending  to uphold this complaint  in respect of loans 7 - 17. For these  particular loans 
Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr O in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Os indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use, over an extended period; and
the length  of time over which Mr O borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
his ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans.
my provisional  decision
I am intending to partially uphold Mr Os complaint and direct Elevate Credit  International Limited, to 
put things right for Mr O as set out above.
