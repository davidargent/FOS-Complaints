The complaint
Mr H complains of issues using his American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) 
mobile banking app. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Im persuaded there was a bug with Amexs app that meant Mr H had to enter his 
password and couldnt use Touch ID. And I think its likely that was caused by the 
issue Mr H identified and reported  that he had multiple Amex apps on his phone.
Amex took a long time to fix the bug, which understandably frustrated Mr H. But Ive 
got to think about this from Amexs perspective too  this was something where there 
a simple workaround (to enter a password) and there werent lots of customers 
reporting the same problem. 
Mr H disagrees that the workaround was simple  hes spoke of the hassle and time 
to enter his password and his concern about doing so in public places. But I think that 
using passwords, even in public places, is still part of everyday life for lots of people. 
So its not something Id say was such an inconvenience or worry that meant Amex 
ought to pay compensation. 
Mr H also raised concerns with how they handled his complaint  and I recognise it 
took a long time to answer and they misunderstood part. But, given what was at 
stake with this issue, Im satisfied the Â£50 awarded fairly reflected the impact this had 
on him. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
