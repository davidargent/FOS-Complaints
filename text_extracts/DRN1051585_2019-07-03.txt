K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible to lend 
him money.
background
Mr B took out four loans  with QuickQuid between January  2016  and June 2018. Mr B topped  
up loans three and four. A summary of his borrowing is below:
Mr B says that he was caught in a spiral  of debt. Mr B would like QuickQuid to refund  the 
interest and charges that hes paid on the loans. And Mr B wants  QuickQuid to remove the 
loans from his credit file.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Bs complaint should  be upheld  in part. In summary, 
he thought that it was reasonable of QuickQuid to agree loans one to three. But by loan four 
the adjudicator  thought that proportionate checks wouldve  shown QuickQuid that Mr B owed 
money to three other short term lenders.
The adjudicator recommended that QuickQuid refund  all interest  and charges that Mr B had 
paid on loan four.  And the adjudicator said QuickQuid should  remove  any negative 
information about loan four from Mr Bs credit  file. 
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view. It says that it did consider Mr Bs other 
credit commitments.  QuickQuid asks whether weve  verified how much Mr B was repaying  
his other  creditors each month.
QuickQuid also says that Mr Bs financial situation  didnt  change until he lost his job.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:Loan Date borrowed
Amount Max instalment
No. of 
instalmentsDate repaid
1 30/01/2016 £100 £123 3 24/04/2016
2 17/08/2016 £100 £125 3 31/10/2016

Ref: DRN10515852the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines sustainable as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
QuickQuid has told us about the checks it did before lending  to Mr B. Before each loan it 
asked him for details  of his income  and normal expenditure. It then validated this information 
against his credit file and other data sources.  And it did further  checks on Mr Bs credit  file 
before each of the loans. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
loans one to three
Given that there was a long gap between loans two and three, I agree with the adjudicator 
that it was reasonable of QuickQuid to agree  loans  one to three based on what it knew about  
Mr B. As Mr B hasnt  raised any objection to the adjudicators recommendation, I dont think  
that I need to say much more about  these three loans.
loan four
Mr B applied for loan four less than a week after repaying loan three.  And Mr B had asked to 
top up loan three before  then extending  his repayment. I think this pattern of lending  
shouldve prompted  QuickQuid to ask Mr B whether he had any other outstanding short term 
loans. 
Ref: DRN10515853If QuickQuid had done this it seems  likely  that it wouldve discovered that Mr B owed money 
to at least three other payday lenders. I consider it was likely  that Mr B was borrowing  further  
just to keep up with his other loan repayments.  Indeed Mr B went on to top up loan four while 
also borrowing elsewhere. I think that with better checks QuickQuid shouldve  realised that it 
was unlikely that Mr B could sustainably repay  loan four. 
I appreciate what QuickQuid says about  Mr Bs financial  situation  only changing after he lost 
his job. But this doesnt change my decision that Mr B wasnt able to afford  to repay  loan four 
in a sustainable way and that QuickQuid shouldnt have agreed loan four including  the top 
up.
I understand that Mr B still owes money  on loan four. As hes had the benefit of the money 
lent, its fair to allow QuickQuid to apply the refund  to any outstanding principal balance if it 
wants.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr B paid on loan four;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan four;
if it chooses to, apply the refund  to any outstanding principal balance  before paying any 
remaining balance (if there is any) to Mr B**; and
remove any negative entries about  loan four from Mr Bs credit file.
If QuickQuid has sold the debt to a third party, it should buy the debt back  before doing what  
Ive said above.  If this isnt possible, QuickQuid should (in addition  to the above if 
necessary):
arrange to repay  any portion of the sum due to the third party  that is made up of 
interest and charges   including any added by the third party;
refund  any interest and charges  that Mr B has already  paid to the third party,  plus 
simple interest from the date of payment to the date of settlement;
ask the third party to remove any negative entries  about  loan four from Mr Bs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
QuickQuid intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
**If after carrying out the above steps there is still an outstanding balance,  I remind  
QuickQuid of its obligation to treat Mr B sympathetically and reasonably  in any repayment  
discussions.
Ref: DRN10515854my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and direct  CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 August 2019.
