The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave him misleading 
information about the removal of his overdraft facility. He says this caused him significant 
distress.
What happened
Mr T holds a current account with NatWest, for a time this was a joint account with Mr Ts 
ex-wife as the other account holder. In August 2021 Mr T and his ex-wife completed a form 
to have her removed from the account. This form included a section asking for details of 
Mr Ts income and expenditure so that NatWest could assess whether he was still eligible for 
an overdraft facility.
On reviewing the information Mr T had provided, NatWest decided it was no longer willing to 
offer him an overdraft facility on this account. So it wrote to Mr T and his ex-wife to say that it 
would only remove her from the account once the overdraft had been repaid, and that at that 
time it would also remove the overdraft facility.
Mr T was unhappy with this, and contacted NatWest to ask for the overdraft facility to remain 
on the account. He spoke with a member of staff who said that they would add a note to his 
account saying that he had asked for the facility to remain. Mr T took this to mean that his 
overdraft facility would not be removed.
On 16 November 2021 Mr T secured a loan with NatWest and used part of this to repay the 
overdraft on his account. On 19 November 2021 NatWest removed the overdraft facility on 
his account. A few days later, Mr T said he tried to pay for some petrol but because he no 
longer had an overdraft facility his card was declined.
Mr T complained to NatWest. NatWest acknowledged that Mr T may have been given 
inconsistent or unclear information about the removal of his overdraft, and offered to pay him 
£200 to recognise the distress this caused. NatWest also confirmed it would be giving 
feedback to the individual that Mr T had discussed the removal of the overdraft with. Mr T 
remained unhappy, so he referred his complaint to us.
One of our adjudicators looked at what had happened but didnt think that NatWest had done 
anything wrong in removing the overdraft facility. She also explained that she felt NatWests 
offer of £200 was appropriate to recognise any distress caused by the unclear information 
given to Mr T. Mr T disagreed, so his complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that NatWest acted appropriately in removing Mr Ts overdraft facility. NatWest 
is entitled to review overdraft facilities at its own discretion, and it gave Mr T reasonable 
notice of what it intended to do.
That said, Ive listened to Mr Ts conversation with NatWest and I understand how he came 
away from that conversation with the understanding that his overdraft limit would not be 
removed. So I agree that Mr T was given unclear information about exactly what would be 
happening with his overdraft facility, and I dont doubt that this was stressful and upsetting 
for him. 
But having thought carefully about all that has happened, I dont think that more significant 
compensation than what has already been offered is warranted here. I think that the £200 
that NatWest has already paid to Mr T is appropriate compensation in all the circumstances 
of this complaint and is in line with what I would have awarded, so I wont be asking NatWest 
to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Ts complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2022.
