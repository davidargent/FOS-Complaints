The complaint
A charity, which I will call E, complains about SumUp Payments Limited. Es representatives 
say that in June 2022, the card payment system SumUp provided stopped working  
causing losses of tens of thousands of pounds.
What happened
Es representatives told us:
E entered into an agreement with SumUp in May 2022. The purpose of the 
agreement was to enable E to take card payments during events it ran through the 
summer and into autumn. The events are cashless, so it is particularly important that 
card payments run smoothly.
They had many conversations with SumUps staff during May 2022 to ensure that 
everything was ready for their first event at the beginning of June 2022.
Their event opened, and at first the card terminals performed as expected. But less 
than an hour after opening the card terminals stopped working. When they called 
SumUp, it explained that Es account had not yet been verified and so their ability to 
take payments had been suspended. Until that point, they had been entirely unaware 
that any verification was necessary  and in particular they did not receive an email 
on 19 May 2022 requesting verification documents.
One of Es trustees was present at the event, so they tried to verify Es account 
immediately. That wasnt possible, because the relevant staff at SumUp were not 
available in the evenings. The impact was that they were unable to make any sales 
for the remainder of the event, and they had to give away free food and drink to 
ensure their customers were comfortable.
Es account was properly verified the following day, and they have been able to take 
payments using SumUp ever since.
SumUp told us:
As an Authorised Payment Institution, it is obliged to verify the identity and business 
nature of the merchants it onboards. However, given that large numbers of people 
sign up for its service and then never process a single transaction, it does not start 
the verification process until after a merchant has processed its first transaction.
In Es case, it was able to electronically verify the identity of Es finance manager (a 
Mrs H). However, Mrs H was not a trustee or director of E, and so it had no way of 
knowing whether she had permission to open an account on Es behalf. That meant it 
needed a power of attorney letter and identification evidence for one of Es trustees.
It sent an email to Es representative on 19 May 2022 to explain that its profile 
needed to be verified. The email explained that until SumUp received the 
documentation it had requested, it could only process transactions up to a total value 
of £5,000  and warned that once you reach this limit, our services will be 
interrupted.
It later clarified to our service that it allows occasional transacting before an account 
is verified. That means that it will allow an unverified merchant to process 
transactions up to a total value of £5,000, but after that limit is reached it will stop 
processing transactions until its verification requirements have been met. It doesnt 
explicitly draw the £5,000 limit to merchants attention during the sign up process, 
because it is able to electronically verify most of them and so the £5,000 limit is not 
an issue. However, once an unverified merchant has processed £100 of transactions, 
it clearly displays a warning in its app to the effect that verification is required.
Whilst it is sorry that Es representatives are unhappy, it followed its process correctly 
in this case and did nothing wrong. As a goodwill gesture it has offered E a £100 
credit towards fees, but E has declined that offer.
In any event, its terms and conditions contain a clause exempting it from being liable 
for any loss or damage resulting from its compliance with requirements imposed on it 
by applicable laws, regulations or rules.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but she didnt uphold it. She thought 
SumUp had sent the email of 19 May 2022, and so she concluded that E should have known 
that verification of its account was required.
Es representatives did not accept our investigators opinion, and they asked for the matter to 
be referred to an ombudsman.
At my request, the investigator then wrote to SumUp to request more information about how 
Es account was opened  and in particular, for any telephone recordings or notes about Es 
representatives discussions with SumUp before their June event. SumUp did not initially 
respond to her request, but did so after I issued my provisional decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on 7 November 2023. I said:
My provisional conclusions are:
Whether or not SumUp sent the disputed 19 May 2022 email, SumUp did not do 
enough to make E aware of its verification requirements.
SumUp should have explicitly warned Es representatives during the sales 
process that Es account could not receive payments of more than £5,000 until it 
had been manually verified.
SumUps failure to warn E about verification limits at an early stage was 
exacerbated by SumUps decision not to enable account verification during the 
evening.
The fair resolution to this complaint is for SumUp to pay E £8,000 in 
compensation.I explain my findings in more detail below.
I acknowledge that our investigator concentrated on the email SumUp says it sent on 19 
May 2022. I cant be sure whether that email was sent, but I understand why our 
investigator concluded that it probably was. However, I dont think that whether the email 
was or was not sent should determine this complaint.
Given the evidence I have been given about both SumUps usual procedures and about 
the way E operates, it is clear that Es SumUp account was always going to need manual 
verification. As SumUp has pointed out, Es finance manager Mrs H was not a trustee or 
director of E. Mrs H entered into the contract with SumUp on Es behalf, so SumUp 
would have known from the outset that it was going to need evidence to show she was 
entitled to do that. I consider that SumUp could and should have explained that to Mrs H 
well before the June 2022 event.
I dont know exactly what SumUp told Mrs H during May 2022. Her evidence is that she 
had several conversations with SumUp prior to the event with the aim of ensuring 
everything ran smoothly, but the verification process and £5,000 limit was not mentioned. 
She also told us that she made very clear to SumUps sales team that E anticipated 
revenue in the region of £20,000 per event, and that E operates across 32 terminals (14 
of which were purchased from SumUp) which itself gives an indication of the likely 
turnover per event.
SumUp has been given the opportunity to explain what its conversations with Mrs H 
covered, but so far has chosen not to do so. In the absence of further evidence I have 
therefore assumed that SumUp did not explain its verification process to Mrs H or to E 
despite having ample opportunities to do so.
I accept that the £5,000 limit was mentioned on SumUps website, but since Ive seen 
nothing to suggest that any of Es representatives were ever directed to that section of 
SumUps website I dont think that is material.
I accept that Es staff were not aware of the contents of SumUps 19 May 2022 email 
until after their June 2022 event started. I am satisfied that if they had been aware of it 
they would have taken action. I think it is more likely than not that the email was sent, but 
given the overall circumstances  and particularly Es structure and the nature of its 
business  I dont think a single email was enough to draw Es attention to the need for 
verification.
Mrs H told us that she didnt see any notifications or warnings in the app. I dont think 
that is surprising, given the expected pattern of Es transactions. E was never intending 
to take payments spread evenly throughout the year. It runs its events in summer and 
autumn, which means that it might need to process tens of thousands of pounds of 
payments during a single evening, then not take another payment for weeks or even 
months. Here, E took its first payment of £2.50 on 31 May 2022  possibly as a test  
then no further payments until its June 2022 event. Assuming everything on the app 
worked as SumUp has told me it should, the in app warning message would have been 
displayed for less than an hour  because Es total transactions reached £5,000 very 
shortly after they reached £100.
I am also satisfied that Es representatives acted quickly once they realised that 
verification was needed. If the relevant staff at SumUp had been available on the 
evening of Es event, I think it is likely that verification could have taken place during the 
event, which would have significantly reduced Es losses. But Es account was not in fact 
verified until the following day.I went on to consider fair compensation, and reached the provisional conclusion that SumUp 
should pay E £8,000 (£7,500 for financial loss and £500 for non-financial loss). In more 
details, I said:
Ive considered what SumUps terms and conditions have to say about the limits of 
SumUps liability, but I dont think there is anything in those terms to suggest that I 
should not order SumUp to pay compensation. There is no dispute here about 
whether SumUp should have complied with the relevant laws, regulations or rules, 
and I note that Es representatives willingly shared verification documentation with 
SumUp once they realised it was needed. In my view, the issue here is not SumUps 
compliance with regulations; the issue is that SumUp did not give E sufficient 
information about its verification requirements.
Broadly speaking, my aim here is to put E in the position it would have been if 
SumUp had made no errors. If everything had happened as it should, I think Es 
account would have been properly verified very shortly after SumUp had accepted 
Es application for a SumUp account. In that case, Es terminals would have worked 
throughout their June 2022 event, and there would have been no interruption to Es 
service.
However, I dont think it would be fair for me to order SumUp to reimburse E for all of 
the losses it claims, in part because I think E has claimed for some of its losses two 
or even three times over. For example, in respect of [one particular item] it appears to 
be claiming for the cost of purchasing each [item], for the money it did not receive 
when the [item] could not be sold, and also for the value of the [items] that had to be 
thrown away. But if everything had gone as it should have done, E would still have 
had to pay its supplier for the [items]. I am prepared to consider an award for loss of 
revenue, but not for the initial costs of purchasing the items. Similarly, I am not 
prepared to consider making an award for the disposal of the items unless E can 
demonstrate that the disposal itself cost money it would not otherwise have had to 
pay (for example if there was so much unanticipated waste that it had to pay 
additional amounts for waste collection).
I also note that Es revenue figures include VAT. I dont think E will be liable to pay 
VAT on sales it did not actually make, and so I dont think I should include VAT 
figures an any loss calculation.
E has suggested that I should assume its revenue for the first 45 minutes of its June 
2022 event is indicative of the revenue it would have received over the rest of that 
same event. Compensation calculated on that basis would be in the region of 
£15,000. But I dont think that would be an appropriate way to assess compensation. 
I understand that Es customers attended the event to see a show, and so I would 
anticipate food and drink sales just before the show to be higher than sales during 
the show.
E has provided me with revenue figures for the events it held in August and 
September 2022. I can see that revenue for each of those events was, on average, 
around £14,600 (excluding VAT). Es revenue for the June 2022 event was around 
£7,100 (again excluding VAT). The difference between the two figures is around 
£7,500, and so I estimate that E lost £7,500 in revenue as a result of SumUps errors. 
(I am not clear on how E managed to take so much more than SumUps £5,000 limit 
during its first event, but I dont think the answer to that question is likely to change 
my mind as to appropriate redress.)Given the nature of the products E was selling  perishable food items  I think it is 
fair for me to order SumUp to pay E the whole of that £7,500 in respect of the 
financial losses it has suffered. If E had been selling something that could have been 
simply packed up and resold on a different day, then I would have considered 
whether I should make an award for loss of profit rather than loss of revenue. But I 
accept Es representatives evidence that the goods had to be thrown away, and so I 
think it is fair for me to base my award on loss of revenue. 
Es representatives have also asked me to make an award for loss of reputation. 
That is a difficult area to assess. I acknowledge that some of Es customers posted 
negative reviews on social media as a result of this incident. But I can also see that E 
has many positive reviews afterwards, and I understand that the events it ran later in 
2022 were successful. I therefore think that overall SumUps error had a relatively 
minor effect on Es reputation, but it is still appropriate for SumUp to pay some 
compensation as a result.
SumUps error also caused E some inconvenience, but again I think the 
inconvenience was relatively minor compared to the direct financial loss. If everything 
had happened as it should, E would still have needed to provide verification 
documents to SumUp. SumUps error meant that Es staff had to complete the 
verification requirements in a rush, but overall I dont think E had to do substantially 
more work than it would otherwise have done. I therefore intend to make a relatively 
small award for inconvenience.
I entirely accept that Es trustees and employees suffered distress as a result of this 
incident, but the complainant here is E  which is a corporate body, and is not itself 
capable of suffering distress. I do not have the power to make an award to E in 
respect of any distress suffered by people associated with it.
In the circumstances, I think it would be fair for me to make an award of £500 in 
respect of Es non-financial losses. That amount is intended to cover both loss of 
reputation and inconvenience.
Es representatives accepted my provisional findings in full, but SumUp did not. Briefly, it 
said:
It rejects the assertion that SumUp failed to warn E about the £5,000 verification limit. 
It proactively wrote to E on 19 May 2023, and that email was sent approximately two 
weeks before Es event. It is sympathetic to Es representatives requirements, but it 
communicated the need for additional documentation to E far in advance of Es 
event.
Whilst it understands that there is some dispute as to extent to which SumUp should 
have made E aware of its verification procedures, it is wrong to flatly state that 
SumUp failed to notify E. Its 19 May 2023 email clearly stated what was needed, and 
explained that if E did not provide the necessary documentation SumUps services 
would be interrupted once E reached the £5,000 limit. It considers it has provided 
ample evidence to show that its 19 May 2023 email was sent.
It could not approve the account during the evening of Es event because it had no 
evidence that Mrs H was authorised to operate the account on Es behalf.
It has not retained telephone recordings of Mrs Hs discussions with its staff. 
However, it notes that the email exchanges between E and SumUp do not mention the June 2022 event. It also says that its customer facing staff are aware of the 
£5,000 limit, and it finds it highly unlikely that they would not have told Mrs H about 
the limit if she had raised any concerns about Es June 2022 event. 
Overall, it considers that the provisional decision chastises it for fulfilling its 
obligations relating to anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same conclusions as I did in my provisional decision for 
the same reasons. I now confirm those provisional conclusions as final.
I do not accept that my findings amount to criticising SumUp for fulfilling its regulatory 
obligations. I entirely accept that SumUp is required to verify the people that use its services 
 and I note that E and its representatives have never disputed that. My criticism of SumUp 
is that I dont think it did enough to explain its verification requirements to Mrs H and to E.
To be clear, I am not saying that I think SumUp should have allowed E to operate its account 
without being subject to verification, and I am not criticising the verification requirements 
themselves. What I am saying is that I think SumUp should have done more to ensure E was 
aware of SumUps verification requirements. Given the importance of the June 2022 event to 
E, I am satisfied that if Es representatives had understood the verification requirements, 
they would have complied with them in time. 
I know there is a dispute about whether E received SumUps 19 May 2023 email. But even if 
E did receive that email, in the particular circumstances of this complaint I dont think SumUp 
did enough to tell E about its requirements.
It is very unfortunate that SumUp is not able to provide recordings of its staff members 
conversations with Es representatives. I acknowledge that SumUp says its staff would have 
told Mrs H about the verification requirements, and I also acknowledge that Mrs Hs 
evidence is that it did not. Given the importance of this issue to E, and the speed with which 
its representatives gathered the required verification documentation once they were aware it 
was needed, I find it very unlikely that Es representatives knew about the verification 
requirements before their June 2022 event. On balance, I remain satisfied that SumUps 
staff had ample opportunity to draw the verification requirements to Mrs Hs attention 
verbally but did not do so.
Es representatives say that the reason SumUp gave for being unable to verify its account on 
the evening of its June 2022 event was that the relevant staff from SumUp were not 
available. I consider that that is a more likely explanation than the fact that Mrs H was not 
one of Es trustees  I understand that one of Es trustees was present at the event, and was 
willing to complete paperwork at the time.
Overall, I dont think SumUp treated E fairly.
Putting things right
For the reasons I gave in my provisional decision, I consider that a total payment of £8,000 
(£7,500 for financial loss and £500 for inconvenience and loss of reputation) is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order SumUp Payments Limited to pay E 
£8,000.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
