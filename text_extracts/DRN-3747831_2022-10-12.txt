The complaint
Mr M says NewDay Ltd irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
Mr M applied for a credit card with NewDay in 2010 (Card 1), it was approved with a limit of 
£350. Mr M was given eight subsequent credit limit increases, with a final credit limit of 
£4,700.
Mr M says it was irresponsible of NewDay to increase his credit limit. He says if NewDay had 
done proper checks it would have seen he could not afford such substantial increases in 
credit. Mr M has also said NewDay then did not follow the correct process when defaulting 
his account. Lastly, Mr M feels it was unfair for NewDay to then close a second credit card 
account (Card 2) he held with it when he raised this complaint.
Our investigator upheld Mr Ms complaint in part. They thought the lending decisions prior to
May 2014 were responsible. But said that given the size of the limit increases from May 
2014 onwards, NewDay should have done more to ensure any limit increases were 
affordable and would not cause Mr M financial harm. Our investigator also explained they did 
not think NewDay had acted incorrectly when defaulting Card 1, or in suspending Card 2.
NewDay disagreed with this assessment. It said Mr Ms account was well-managed and that 
the data it received from the credit reference agency at each limit increase showed no signs 
of arrears or financial difficulty markers.
As an agreement was not reached the complaint was passed to me for an ombudsmans
review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending - including all the relevant rules,
guidance and good industry practice - is set out on our website and I have followed it here.
NewDay is required to lend responsibly. It needed to conduct checks to make sure tthe
credit facilities it was giving to Mr M were affordable and sustainable. Such checks need to
be proportionate to things like the credit limits it offered Mr M, how much he had to repay
each month, his borrowing history with it and what it knew about his circumstances.
Due to the time thats passed, there isnt any evidence or detail of any checks for the limit 
increases prior to 2014. So, Ive taken into account the evidence I do have, which includes 
some of Mr Ms statements showing how he managed his accounts. Given the initial credit 
limit increases offered to Mr M were for relatively small amounts, £300-£400 at a time, and 
he managed these without issue for a number of years, they dont look to have been 
unaffordable. So, with what I have seen I think it was reasonable for NewDay to have 
concluded the card and its repayments would be sustainably affordable for Mr M, up to and 
including the limit increase in January 2013.
In May 2014 NewDay increased Mr Ms limit from £1,900 to £2,850. This was a significant 
increase and NewDay needed to be sure Mr M could sustainably repay it within a 
reasonable period of time. NewDays submission suggests that the decision to increase the 
credit limit on Mr Ms account was largely based on reviewing his spending and payment 
behaviour on both the NewDay card, and external credit. In the circumstances of this case I 
dont think solely these types of checks were sufficient given how much NewDay was 
increasing Mr Ms limit by. As a result, further checks should have been done so NewDay 
could be sure that Mr M would be able to sustainably repay a higher balance in a reasonable 
period of time. 
To look at what better checks would most likely have shown NewDay I have reviewed 
Mr Ms bank statements from the months prior to the limit increase. I am not saying NewDay 
had to do exactly this, but it is one way for me to recreate what a fuller financial review would
most likely have shown NewDay. The statements do suggest that Mr M was having 
problems managing his finances, given that he was relying significantly on short term 
lenders. Ive also seen Mr Ms credit file, which goes back to 2013 and so gives me a picture 
of his other lending at that time. And Mr Ms credit file shows me that between January 2013 
and May 2014 Mr Ms total borrowing had almost tripled, with much of this being on credit 
cards. So had NewDay carried out proportionate checks, perhaps including a review of Mr 
Ms income and outgoings at that time, it would most likely have seen that Mr M was not in a 
position to be able to repay any new debt sustainably, that is without borrowing to repay or 
suffering other financial harm. 
It follows I think NewDay was wrong to increase Mr Ms limit in May 2014. I have then
looked at Mr Ms bank statements in the months after the limit increased. His finances
show no sign of improvement, so I dont think NewDay can argue it was responsible to 
continue to increase his limit. So I find all subsequent limit increases were also irresponsible. 
I acknowledge that NewDay says it was a change in circumstances that led to Mr Ms 
account ultimately being defaulted, and I can see that Mr M did ask for help with his account 
after he lost his job in July 2015. But I can also see that he had raised concerns about his 
financial situation prior to losing his job and his bank statements show that he was already 
relying on payday loans to keep him afloat, and had been for some time. And, in any case, I 
dont think the fact that Mr Ms financial situation worsened in 2015 means that he wasnt 
also struggling financially before then.
I acknowledge that Mr M is also unhappy with NewDays actions when it defaulted Card 1, 
and the suspension of Card 2 when he complained. But overall I agree with what our 
investigator has said about these issues, Im satisfied that Mr M was made aware of the 
potential for Card 1 to default as Ive seen he was sent letters about this. I also think it was 
reasonable for NewDay to decide to suspend Card 2 when he told it he was struggling 
financially, as the terms of the account allow for this and it would have stopped him owing 
any more to NewDay. So I dont find that NewDay needs to do anything more regarding 
these two issues.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay should have increased Mr Ms credit limit on Card 1 above £1,900, I 
dont think its fair for it to charge any interest or charges on any balances which exceeded 
that limit. However, Mr M has had the benefit of all the money he spent on the account so I 
think he should pay this back. Therefore, NewDay should:
:Rework Card 1 removing all interest, fees, charges and insurances (not already 
refunded) that have been applied to balances above £1,900
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mr M along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded 
from May 2014 onwards regarding this account from Mr Ms credit file. 
Or, if after the rework the outstanding balance still exceeds £1,900, NewDay should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mr M for the remaining amount. Once 
Mr M has cleared the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 
May 2014 in relation to the account should be removed from his credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2022.
