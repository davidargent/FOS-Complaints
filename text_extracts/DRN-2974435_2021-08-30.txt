The complaint
Mrs S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has refused to refund the cost of an
item she bought that was damaged.
What happened
Mrs S says she bought an item for just under £140 that arrived damaged. She says she
followed PayPals instructions in order to receive a refund and sent the item back to the
seller in China. Mrs S says she paid £30 for the returned delivery cost and provided
evidence to PayPal but the item was held in customs in China which she says was not her
fault. She would like her money refunded.
PayPal says Mrs S filed a claim that the item wasnt received before amending it to item
significantly not as described. It says it didnt receive evidence the item was delivered to
the seller and so in line with its user agreement wasnt obliged to refund the item cost.
Mrs S brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld it and recommended PayPal
re-assess her claim. The investigator thought Mrs S had followed PayPals instructions and
that it wasnt her fault the item hadnt been returned to the sender. The investigator also
thought that as the item had now been returned to Mrs S it could be sent to PayPal for
inspection.
PayPal doesnt accept that view and says it acted line with its user agreement and due to the
time that has elapsed says it cant re-open the claim. It maintains it didnt receive evidence
the item was returned.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said as follows.
I said that I thought PayPal has acted fairly and in line with its user agreement. I accepted 
that Mrs S was not at fault here and followed PayPals instructions, but I said that doesnt 
mean I can fairly hold PayPal responsible for what took place and for events I didnt think it 
had any control over.
I looked carefully at PayPals user agreement and could see that it required evidence
that the returned item was sent and delivered to the sellers address. I didnt think the item in
question was ever returned to the seller for reasons that were not clear and so I didnt think
PayPal made a mistake by rejecting Mrs Ss claim for a refund in those circumstances.
 
I appreciated what the investigator said, that we can consider a complaint outside of the user 
agreement and fairly consider that Mrs S did what was required. But I also thought PayPal
equally didnt do anything wrong or make a mistake and I couldnt fairly hold it responsible 
for the safe delivery of mail in China.
I also considered what the investigator recommended and what PayPal says about
that. The investigator didnt recommend PayPal refund Mrs S but recommended it re-assess
her claim. PayPal says its out of time for doing so and so I said I cant fairly order PayPal to 
do something it couldnt do. I hoped PayPal would consider Mrs Ss complaint and consider 
if as a gesture of goodwill, it was prepared to assist her further. But I made clear that my 
provisional view was that PayPal wasnt responsible for the delivery problems and was 
entitled to reject a claim when its conditions were not met.
PayPal says it doesnt wish to comment further on this complaint.
Mrs S says it is unjust that she has lost out and incurred further costs. She says the item 
shouldnt have been held in customs and questions why she and not PayPal isnt penalised 
for what took place.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view that I reached in my provisional view 
and for the same reasons. I appreciate Mrs S says PayPal should be penalised and 
questions why the item was held in customs. 
I cant fairly hold PayPal responsible for what took place and make clear to Mrs S that its not 
our role to punish a business. I have also made clear that Mrs S didnt meet the user 
agreement rules, and, in those circumstances, PayPal was entitled to reject her claim.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2021.
