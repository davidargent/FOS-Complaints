The complaint
Mr A says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to 
him.                           
Background
This complaint is about nine instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr A between April 2018 
and June 2019. Mr As borrowing history is as follows:

repayment
1 28/04/2018 06/07/2018 £250 £66.95
2 29/04/2018 22/08/2018 £150 £106.91

10 14/06/2019 26/07/2019 £50 £16.67
 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr As complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall pattern of Mr As borrowing indicated he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable. Sunny disagreed but 
offered to uphold loans 8, 9 and 10. This offer was put to Mr A, but he rejected it. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
My findingsIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr As complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr As complaint about loans 1 to 5. Mr A hasnt provided any 
further evidence or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr A, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. Given the circumstances of Mr As case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr A was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr A had taken out six loans in eight months. So, it should have realised 
it was more likely than not Mr A was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr As indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 10 was 
taken out 14 months after Mr As first. Mr A had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr A lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr A borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr As ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
Putting things right  what Elevate Credit International Limited needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 6 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loan 6 to 10 should be removed from      
Mr As credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate Credit International Limited must give Mr A a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr As complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
