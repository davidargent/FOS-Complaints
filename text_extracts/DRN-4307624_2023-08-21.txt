The complaint
Mr R has complained that 1.618 Advisory Services UK Limited (1.618) mis-sold him a 
whole of life, level term policy.
What happened
Mr R applied for a whole of life policy, initially with £100,000 of cover. He then wished to 
increase cover to £150,000. At this stage the insurer requested a medical assessment which 
showed that Mr Rs height and weight had been incorrectly recorded. This in turn meant his 
BMI was 38 rather than 32. The insurer advised 1.618 that Mr R could either increase his 
premiums so he maintained £100,000 of cover or reduce the amount of cover to £63,500 
and keep his premiums the same. 
1.618 instructed the insurer to reduce the cover so as to maintain the same premium, but not 
tell Mr R this or send any policy documents to him. Mr R later found out that he only had 
£63,500 life cover and took out another policy with a different insurer for £40.000. 
Our investigator explained that he felt Mr R hadnt been treated fairly. He recommended that 
1.618 pay him for the ongoing loss he would have by paying greater premiums - £9,758, and 
£500 in compensation. 1.618 didnt agree. It said that Mr R portrayed a picture of severely 
improved health status and that there was never any intention for the insurer to offer him 
£100,000 of cover. It said that reasonable cover based on Mr Rs true health at the policys 
inception would have been in the region of £63,500. It said that this sum was communicated 
to Mr R annually.
As no agreement was reached I issued a provisional decision on 4 August 2023. I said as 
follows:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so I broadly agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these 
reasons: 
 Mr R believed he was paying for £100,000 worth of cover. In fact, the insurer had 
explained to 1.618 that it wasnt prepared to offer this amount of cover based on Mr Rs BMI. 
1.618 took the unilateral decision to keep the premium at the same level and reduce the sum 
insured. It didnt give Mr R the opportunity to choose whether he wished to pay more for 
£100,000 of cover. Fortunately, it hasnt been necessary to claim, but nevertheless I find Mr 
R was prejudiced by this omission on the part of 1.618. Im satisfied that had he been 
advised that he could reduce cover or increase premiums, he would either have chosen to 
increase his premiums in order to have cover of £100,000 or gone elsewhere to get this 
amount of whole of life cover. I reach this conclusion because when he discovered the error, 
he took out another policy to make up the difference. 
 1.618 says there was never any intention to given Mr R £100,000 in cover. I agree that the 
intention wasnt to give him that cover for the premium originally offered as the medical 
information was incorrect. However once the correct details had been entered the insurer 
was prepared to offer that sum for the greater premium. 
 In February 2021 Mr R took out a second policy for £40,000  which meant in total he had 
£103,500 worth of cover. He now pays two monthly amounts and for more than he would be 
paying had he been offered and taken the cover in 2016. In 2016 £100,000 of cover would 
have cost £210 a month. In 2021 he was paying £41 per month for the extra £40,000 of 
cover. However he did have more cover than he would have had if 1.618 hadnt made the 
error it did. His 2021 policy is index linked, but for the purposes of this decision Im using the 
premium as of February 2021. 
 A whole of life policy is in place until death. Our investigator speculated that cover may 
remain in place until Mr R is 85 years old. He recognised that Mr R may live less or longer 
but advised we dont have actuarial facilities to make an actuarial calculation. This is correct. 
I think in the circumstances it is fair and reasonable to use the age of 85, looking at data 
from the Office for National Statistics. I agree therefore that that Mr R should be 
compensated for the approximate extra amount he will pay until age 85. If 1.618 wishes to 
make further representations in this regard (or any other) it may do so in response to this 
provisional decision. 
 Accordingly I provisionally find that it would be fair to compensate Mr R by way of lump 
sum. I have taken into account that Mr R had more cover from 2021 than he would have had 
had no error been made. So the calculation I have used is £37.50 (assumed extra amount 
from February 2021 to purchase £36,500, as £40,000 was £41) x 238 (months until Mr R 
reaches 85 years) = £8925. 
 I find that Mr R has been caused worry and inconvenience because of 1.618s error and 
has had to go to some trouble to attempt to correct it. I find compensation is due for this and 
Im satisfied that £500 is fair.
I invited both parties to respond. Mr R made the point that he wasnt able to purchase the 
exact amount to bring his cover to £100,000. But he agreed with my provisional findings. 
1.618 didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
But as Mr R has accepted and 1.618 has not responded to my provisional decision I see no 
reason to change my findings, which I adopt here.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require 
1.618 Advisory Services UK Limited to pay Mr R two sums:
1. £8925 
2. £500 in compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 September 2023.
