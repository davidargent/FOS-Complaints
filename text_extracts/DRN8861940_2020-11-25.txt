Mrs C complains that Aviva Life & Pensions  UK Limited failed to pay out the proceeds from 
one of her pension plans in the 2017/18 tax year. She says that as a result  of its error the 
lump sum wasnt paid until the 2018/19 tax year. And this had an impact  on her plans  to take 
income from her other pension arrangements  over time.
background 
Mrs C has said she contacted Aviva  about  taking her benefits in mid-February 2018. Aviva  
sent her a Retirement Options Pack  around 13 February 2018. Mrs C said her husband had 
become unwell and was undergoing medical tests, so the matter took a back  seat.  She 
called Aviva on 28 March  2018 stressing that she wanted to take her pension  as a         
lump-sum payment in the 2017/18  tax year. She says she was told to return  the forms no 
later than 29 March 2018 which was their cut off date for processing payments for that tax 
year. 
Mrs C returned the forms by post the same day and its not in dispute  that Aviva  received 
them on 29 March 2018.
Aviva contacted Mrs C on 4 April 2018 saying that it needed further documents to verify her 
identity. She sent them immediately  and they were  received by Aviva  on 5 April 2018. The 
pension was paid on 9 April 2018, falling into the 2018/2019 tax year.
Mrs C has said this resulted in her losing  the majority of her personal  tax allowance for the 
2017/18 tax year. Her only income at that time was from an annuity   for £1,054. Shes  said 
it also had an impact  on two other  pension  plans she was going to take in the 2018/19 and 
2019/20 tax years; taking another pension in the 2018/19 tax year would have resulted in 
losing more of it in tax.
I issued a provisional decision on the complaint on 12 October 2020. I noted 
Mrs C had contacted  Aviva on Wednesday 28 March and Aviva had received her completed 
forms on Thursday 29 March. Easter fell on this weekend, so Friday 30 March and Monday 2 
April were non-working days.  Aviva had said if Mrs C had been told about the identity 
documents requirement on 28 March it would have received them on 29 March, and given 
the two bank holidays started  work  on the request on 3 April instead  of 4 April.  So there was 
only a difference  of one working  day. 
Mrs C had spoken to Aviva by telephone explaining her intention  to take the benefits  on 28 
March. Shed said she stressed she wanted payment in the 2017/18 tax year. And was told 
that there  was a cut-off date for receipt  of the relevant forms by 29 March. 
A recording of the call wasnt available. But the letter  Mrs C sent to Aviva which it received 
on 29 March did say in bold at the top PLEASE ESCALATE TO PROCESS IN THIS 
CURRENT TAX YEAR.  The letter also said that when Mrs C had contacted  Aviva  about the 
matter in February 2018 she hadnt  been told there was a cut off date of 29 March 2018  
for the paperwork to be received. So I thought this was consistent with what  Mrs C had said 
she was told in her conversation.
The firm also had a record of an internal e-mail sent to a support team on the morning of 29 
March 2018 which said Mrs C wanted  payment to be made  in the 2017/18 tax year as a 
matter of priority and asking if payment could be escalated to ensure it was made on time.
Ref: DRN88619402I thought Mrs C had left it late to contact  Aviva to take benefits for the 2017/18 tax year. 
Firms are busy at that time of year with similar requests  and ordinarily I thought Aviva had 
processed the transaction in a reasonable timescale. However I said each case  needed to 
be considered  on its own particular circumstances. I said I was satisfied that Mrs C had been 
told the payment  would be processed in time if Aviva received the documents  by 29 March. I 
didnt think this necessarily meant  that whatever happened Aviva  was bound  by it. But I 
thought it meant that it was under a duty to treat the request as urgent and as a matter  of 
priority. 
 
The internal  e-mail showed it was aware of the urgency of the matter  on the morning of 29 
March and it had received  the relevant documents. I thought it was bound  to treat the matter 
urgently, but it didnt  appear to have  looked  at the paperwork  until Wednesday  4 April (albeit 
I accepted with the Easter break this was two working days later). But taking everything  into 
account and given what the firm had told Mrs C which  I think put it on a higher duty,  I thought 
it had sufficient time and opportunity to process  the transaction for payment to be made 
within the 2017/18 tax year. 
During the course of our investigation into the complaint Aviva had said that it could contact 
and resolve the issue with HMRC and was willing to pay any associated  costs. However this 
wasnt until July 2019, and it had previously said this was a matter for Mrs C to resolve with 
HMRC although it provided some  information  to help her to do so. By July 2019 Mrs C had 
altered her plans to take the pensions in light of the payment being included in the 2018/19 
tax year.  So it was too late to take this action to make any material  difference.  If Aviva had 
offered to do this when  Mrs C had first complained to it, it may have been able to resolve the 
issue with little impact on Mrs Cs plans.
So taking all the circumstances into account, I said I was provisionally minded to uphold Mrs 
Cs complaint. 
I went onto address the issue  of fair compensation.  I said I didnt think it was a 
straightforward matter.
Mrs C had three personal pensions which she said shed planned to take as lump-sums over 
the three tax years  2017/18 to 2019/20, and then take her State Pension in the 2020/21 tax 
year. I thought  what she said shed planned  to do was both logical  and credible, and I 
accepted they were  her plans.
If Mrs C had stuck  to her original plans she would  have  had more  tax deducted from the 
second pension  she planned to take in the 2018/19 tax year and so would have received 
correspondingly less from it. However Mrs C changed her plans given the circumstances. 
I said my understanding was that Mrs Cs only income for 2017/18 was the annuity she was 
receiving of £1,054.  And that in the following years, as well as the £1,054,  she received: 
2018/2019 - a lump sum of approximately £25,800 (net of tax) from Aviva 
2019/2020 - a lump sum of approximately £38,000 (net of tax) from another pension.  Plus 
her State Pension started during  the tax year which paid £6,879 (for that reminder of that tax 
year).
2020/21  Her State Pension of £10,083.  
Ref: DRN88619403Mrs C also has a defined benefit  pension which she intends to transfer and take as a lump 
sum. Its value is approximately £44,000. 
If things had gone to plan Mrs C would have  received the £25,800  before 6 April 2018. Then 
she would  have been able to take the value  of the second pension sometime between  April 
2018 and April 2019 and so forth. So Mrs C had lost out on the use of some of her money  
from an earlier date. But for exactly what periods  was difficult  to say. For example, if the 
£25,800 had been paid in the 2017/18  tax year, she may not have needed to take the 
second pension  until near the end of the 2018/19  tax year.  And Mrs C had said she took her 
State Pension from 6 July 2019, whereas she initially said shed planned  to defer taking  it 
until the 2020/21 tax year (rather than 2019/20  as I said in my provisional decision). So she 
was in receipt of some  income that she otherwise had planned not to be. And she made an 
informed decision to start taking the State Pension in 2019/20  which meant her tax liability  
for that year would have been  higher given the lump sum she received from another  
pension.
So I thought  Mrs C had lost the use of some of her money, but it was difficult to say exactly 
how much  income Mrs C had not had the use of, for what period, and how much, if any, 
additional tax she had paid to date as a result of the delayed payment. I went on to outline 
what I thought  was fair compensation.
I invited Aviva and Mrs C to send me any further  evidence or arguments that they wanted 
me to consider before I issued my final decision.
Mrs C responded to say, in summary, that it appeared her tax liability  on taking her 
remaining pension was going to be about  £500  more than the £2,000  I had awarded in my 
provisional decision. She noted I had said it was difficult  to determine exactly  what  amount of 
money she had lost out on use of because she hadnt yet accessed her remaining pension. 
She said it could be taken as true that she was definitely going  to cash  in her remaining 
pension in August  2018  and it was when getting  the paperwork together the Aviva  error 
came to her attention.  She said the original adjudicator had found that the encashment  was 
delayed from August 2018  to the beginning of the following 2019/20 tax year and it would be 
appropriate for Mrs C to receive  an interest payment based on a rate of 8% between  the end 
of August  2018  and the end of the 2018/19 tax year. Mrs C asked that I agreed to the same.
Aviva said it had nothing  further to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive seen no reason to 
depart from the findings in my provisional  decision.
As I explained in that decision,  fair compensation isnt a straightforward matter  as Mrs C has 
adjusted her original plans and so its difficult to mirror the intended position. For example 
she took her State pension earlier. And the remaining pension has been invested over a 
longer period. I accept the income  she has received/ tax paid and lump sum payments wont  
exactly correspond to what would  otherwise  have  been the case.  But this isnt an exact 
science. Ive carefully considered what Mrs C has said about the compensation I outlined in 
my provisional decision. But having done  so, Im satisfied, given the uncertainty  of the 
different positions,  that its fair in the particular circumstances of the case.
Ref: DRN88619404my final decision
Accordingly, my final decision is that I uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
I order Aviva  Life & Pensions UK Limited  to pay Mrs C 
£750 for the distress and inconvenience  caused by the matter
£2,000, being the approximate amount of additional basic rate tax that wouldnt 
otherwise have been paid if Avivas payment had been made  in the 2017/18  tax year.  
I think this only crystalizes when Mrs C takes her final pension. So Aviva should pay 
this part of the compensation to Mrs C on receipt of evidence from Mrs C that she 
has taken that pension as a lump  sum.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 December  2020.
