The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc set up an unaffordable repayment plan 
after his account became overdrawn.
What happened
On 17 May 2019 Mr G spoke with NatWest to discuss his current account. Mr G said that 
pending transactions on his account meant the outstanding balance wasnt clear. As a result, 
he was around £20,000 overdrawn and needed to discuss options for repayment. 
During the call with NatWest Mr G gave information about his income and outgoings. The 
figures provided indicated Mr G had disposable income and NatWests call handler agreed 
to set up a payment arrangement for £1,110 for 18 months, which would repay the 
outstanding balance. 
In June 2019 Mr G contacted NatWest and complained. Mr G went on to refer his concerns 
to our service and his complaint was passed to an investigator. The investigator listened to 
the call Mr G had with NatWest when the payment arrangement was agreed and said that, 
based on the information hed provided, it appeared affordable. Mr G said he wanted to pay 
£200 a month towards the outstanding balance to avoid any adverse credit being reported. 
But NatWest took the decision to close Mr Gs account and hes told us his credit file has 
been affected as a result. Mr G asked to appeal so his complaint has been passed to me to 
make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G has made a number of complaints about NatWest and how transactions from his 
account were approved. Mr G has also complained that NatWest closed his account. Please 
note that in this decision, Im going to look at the payment arrangement Mr G discussed with 
NatWest on 17 May 2019 and whether it made any mistakes when discussing options with 
Mr G. Mr Gs other complaints have been dealt with separately and he will receive 
responses concerning those cases in due course. 
Mr G has sent us details of his income and outgoings which he says shows the £1,110 
monthly payment arrangement wasn't affordable. Ive looked at the information Mr G sent us 
and agree that, based on those figures, £1,110 isnt affordable. But I have to balance that 
against the information Mr G gave NatWest when he discussed his circumstances on 17 
May 2019. During that call, Mr G gave information about his income and outgoings. The 
information Mr G gave to NatWest differs significantly to what he subsequently told the 
investigator. Based on what Mr G told NatWest, he was able to afford the £1,110 payment 
arrangement. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr G but I think NatWest acted reasonably when it relied on the 
information he provided as a basis to check whether the payment arrangement was affordable. During the call, Mr G confirmed to NatWest that he could maintain the agreed 
repayments. I haven't found that NatWest made an error by agreeing a payment 
arrangement.
Mr G also asked about other options and was told there were none. Mr G could either repay 
the outstanding balance over an 18 month period (which required monthly payments of 
£1,110) or his account would have been closed. I appreciate other events later impacted the 
situation, but Im satisfied NatWest gave the correct information to Mr G when he called. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr G but I havent been persuaded to uphold this complaint. NatWest 
took detailed information from Mr G and used it as a basis for a payment arrangement. Im 
satisfied it acted fairly when trying to agree an affordable repayment plan and that its 
decision to rely on the information Mr G provided was reasonable. As I havent found 
anything to show NatWest made a mistake, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 May 2020.
