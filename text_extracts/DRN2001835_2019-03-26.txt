K820x#14complaint
Ms C complains that Zurich Assurance Ltd reduced her sum assured on her life assurance 
policy without making her aware. 
background
In June 1998 Ms C purchased a lifestyle plus benefit  plan with extra  cover. The sum assured 
was £43,000 and the monthly premiums were  £15. But the plan would be reviewable on its 
10th anniversary. 
In 2008 the policy was reviewed and the sum assured reduced to £18,216.  This was due to 
a lower than expected fund performance. But Ms C was offered an option to continue  with 
the sum assured of £43,000 but the monthly  premium would increase to £18.88. Ms C chose 
this option. In 2013 a further  review  was completed  and the sum assured remained the same 
for the same monthly premium. 
Zurich has said in June  2018 it sent the plan review  to Ms C. It said in order  to keep  the level 
of cover at £43,000 the premium would increase to £28.84. If Ms C wished to keep the 
monthly premium at £18.88 the sum assured would reduce to £18,216. But Zurich said it 
didnt receive a response from Ms C. So, the plan was reduced to the basic  policy meaning 
the level of cover reduced to £18,216  and the premium remained   at  £18.88.
Ms C said that she never received the letter and the first time she became aware that her 
level of cover had decreased was when she received her annual statement in September 
2018. 
So Ms C complained to Zurich about this. It said it could allow  her to continue with the plan 
on extra  cover basis (increasing the sum assured to £43,000 with a monthly premium of 
£28.84) but it would  require her to complete  a declaration of health which it asked to be 
returned in December 2018. It confirmed  if it didnt hear from Ms C by December 2018  it 
would continue with a sum assured  of £18,216  for a monthly payment of £18.88 until the 
next review took pace.  Ms C didnt respond  to Zurich by that deadline, so her current level of 
cover is £18,216 for a premium of £18.88.
Ms C remained unhappy.  She didnt  think it was reasonable that the sum assured had 
reduced to £18,216,  and she was unhappy that she would need to pay £28.84 in order to 
have a level of cover of £43,000 as she feels the market hadnt done  that badly to warrant 
such an increase in premium. She feels the same  level of cover should  be offered for a 
modest increase  in premium. So she brought the complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but she didnt recommend that it be upheld.  She 
said she was satisfied  it was clear that the policy was reviewable  after 10 years and this 
could lead to an increase  in premiums. So she didnt think  Zurich had acted unreasonably. 
Ms C disagreed so the case was passed  to me to consider.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
investigators findings for broadly the same reasons. I will explain why.
Ref: DRN20018352policy reviews
It goes on to say there may be favourable reviews or unfavourable reviews and explains 
what this means and how it can impact the sum assured and premiums. This information  is 
also outlined  in the terms and conditions and the policy schedule.  
When the policy was reviewed on the 10th anniversary Ms C had to increase her premiums 
to £18.88 in order to keep  the sum assured at £43,000. And in 2013  when the policy was 
reviewed again,  there  was no increase  to the premiums and the sum assured stayed the 
same. So with this is mind, I am satisfied  that Ms C was aware the policy  was reviewable  
and the potential consequences  of this.
increase in premiums
The policy itself was set up on a reviewable whole  of life basis   this meant  that it would 
provide critical illness cover whilst also building up a fund to potentially  support the level of 
cover at a lower premium  for longer. Ms C had the benefit of the cover at £43,000 for a 
premium of £15 for 10 years, which was the purpose  of the policy.  But this means at certain 
intervals, Zurich reviews the policy to establish  if the premiums Ms C is paying can support 
the level of cover she has in place.  When  she took out the policy she would  have been  
aware that the amount  of cover reflects changes in the investment performance and trends 
in health and life expectancy (this is outline in the policy reviews). 
So while I appreciate that Ms C is unhappy that her monthly premiums will need to increase 
to £28.84, in order to keep the level of cover  at £43,000, I think its reasonable to say she 
was aware that her level of cover may change as it depended on the fund performance and 
other external factors. And while she would be willing to accept a 10% increase in premiums 
(in order to keep the same level of cover) or 10% reduction in cover (for the premium to 
remain at £18.88),  Zurich  needs to ensure the premiums can support that level of cover.  In 
this case in order to keep the cover  at £43,000 it has calculated the monthly premium needs 
to be £28.84. And Ive not seen  anything to suggest that this is incorrect. As Ms C was 
aware the review  could  be favourable  or unfavourable, and the potential consequences  of 
this, I cant say Zurich has acted unreasonably.
review letter
I appreciate that Ms C didnt receive  the review letter  in June 2018. And I understand it 
would have been concerning when Ms C received her annual statement and found out that 
her level of cover had reduced. But I can see that the letter  was dated June 2018 and had 
the same  address we have on file for Ms C. So on balance I think it is likely the letter was 
sent. This is not to say that Ms C received the letter  but I cant  hold Zurich  responsible  for 
the postal service. 
In any event, when  Ms C complained to Zurich about this, it agreed  to extend the deadline. 
But in order for it to do this, it needed  Ms C to complete a declaration of health by December 
2018. I think this is reasonable as it allowed Ms C to have the same  options she would have 
had and at the review  in June 2018.  As Ms C didnt complete a declaration of health, the 
sum assured remains at the decreased level and I think  this is fair.
Ref: DRN20018353So with that in mind I wont be asking Zurich  to do anything further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 April 2019.
