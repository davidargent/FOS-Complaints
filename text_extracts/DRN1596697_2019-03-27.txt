K821x#15complaint
Mr E complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid and as Pounds to Pocket, 
was irresponsible  by approving loans  for him which he could not afford  and without carrying 
out the appropriate creditworthiness  checks.  
Mr E is represented through a third party.  
background
Using the information from CashEuroNet I have summarised some of the details about the 
approved loans and they are in Table A.

Loans 1 to 13 were  with QuickQuid. Loan  14 was an instalment loan with Pounds to Pocket. 
CENs explanation  in November 2017  to us when the complaint first came to this service 
was that the disposable  income calculation for Mr E was a subtraction of his reported 
expenditure from his reported income.  These appear in Table  A as the first calculation.  
CashEuroNet said: 
As well as using verified information obtained  from the Mr [E], QuickQuid carried  out 
an assessment of affordability and creditworthiness to verify the reasonableness of 
Ref: DRN15966972his self-reported income. The checks incorporated current financial commitments,  
credit inquiries, credit-scoring information  from Credit Reference Agenciesplus 
various other  third party reports.
And for the last loan which was with Pounds to Pocket  Loan 14  CEN explained:
The data file shows that Mr [E] had enough  disposable income to meet his Pounds  to 
Pocket installment  [sic] payments, however no contractual payments were made.
Our adjudicator asked  Mr Es representative  for more information (including copies of his 
bank statements) on more  than one occasion.  These were  not sent to us and Mr Es 
representative emailed  us to say that it was content for our adjudicator  to proceed without 
them. So our adjudicator considered the complaint on the information she had. 
Our adjudicator thought that CashEuroNet should put things  right for the lending decisions 
on and after 29 August 2015 which appears  as Loan 7 in Table A. So our adjudicators  
opinion was that Mr Es complaint should  be upheld for Loans 7 to 14. 
Briefly she was of the view that Loans  1 and 2 were ones she could not assess thoroughly 
due to lack of information provided by Mr E or his representative. 
She also had the view that the two year lending gap before Loan 3 made a difference and 
she thought that Loans  3, 4 and 5 likely  appeared affordable even though  she did not have 
any bank statements from Mr E so she could not be sure. For Loan 6 she was not able to 
assess Mr Es financial  position thoroughly as Mr E had not supplied enough of the 
information we had requested. 
Our adjudicator thought that from Loan  7 the pattern of borrowing ought to have  prompted  
CashEuroNet to have  questioned whether continuing to offer further  loans to a customer 
who appeared to be reliant on this form of lending  was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
She came to her final opinion which was that if better checks  had been  completed and 
CashEuroNet had given  more consideration to the pattern of borrowing, it would have been 
clear to it, as a responsible lender, that the loans were not being used for what they were 
intended for and were  becoming unsustainable  for Mr E. She upheld  Loans 7 to 14. 
Neither Mr E nor CashEuroNet  agreed  with our adjudicators view and so the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision. 
Despite Mr E disagreeing with the adjudication, and Mr Es representative  saying that 
additional evidence  would be sent to us by the deadline date, nothing further by way of 
documentation or an explanation for the reason for the challenge has been  provided by Mr E 
or his representative. 
CashEuroNets submissions to us in response  to the adjudicators  opinion  were more 
detailed. CashEuroNet  explained that for loans approved after March 2015 (in Mr Es case 
that would  mean from Loan 3) it had carried out an affordability review and sent to us the 
thirteen page  Lending  criteria and Proportionate checks  document. I have seen this before 
and I will refer to as its key procedures document. 
 
CashEuroNet explained also that as part of its assessment before lending from March  2015, 
it took Mr Es declared credit commitment figure (one of the categories of Mr Es declared  
Ref: DRN15966973expenditure) which it then compared  with its CRA Validated  check. CRA is reference to the 
credit bureau agencies it used. CashEuroNet explained that it would have taken  the higher 
figure if they were different. 
CashEuroNet then went on to explain that using the higher credit  commitment figure it would  
have calculated Mr Es estimated disposable income (EDI) which  would have been used as 
part of its assessment before lending. These EDI figures appear in Table  A as the more 
recent calculations.  And I refer to these figures later in this decision and duplicate  them  in 
Table B.
The complaint has been passed  to me for a decision. And despite not having received 
further information from Mr Es representative  I do consider that its appropriate to continue 
on the evidence  I have as Mr E and his representative have had opportunities to send us 
what they wished  to on several  occasions. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Es case.
For Loans 1 and 2 the Office of Fair Trading  (OFT) Guide  was the reference document  for 
businesses in receipt of  the OFT consumer credit  licences  and applicable to Mr Es 
complaint before April 2014. Briefly, before lending money to a consumer a lender should 
have taken proportionate steps  to understand whether the consumer was able to repay what  
they were borrowing in a sustainable manner without it adversely  impacting on their financial  
situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
For the loans  from Loan  3, the relevant regulations included the Financial Conduct 
Authoritys (FCA) Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC). CONC sets out some of the rules 
and guidance  for consumer  credit  providers such as CashEuroNet.  Some of the guidance 
changed on 1 November 2018 and so the CONC rules and guidance I refer to here were  
those in place  at the time CashEuroNet lent to Mr E from April 2015. 
In short,  CashEuroNet  needed to assess Mr Es ability  to repay  the credit in a sustainable 
way. CONC (e.g. CONC 5.2.3-4G) gave  some guidance about appropriate considerations  
these included the type, amount and cost of the credit, as well as the financial position  of the 
consumer. These gave indications of appropriate factors to take into account, not explicit  or 
prescriptive rules.
Nonetheless what the rules and guidance do make clear is that CashEuroNet needed to be 
satisfied Mr E could afford to repay  the loans in a sustainable  way. It needed to take into 
account the borrower-focused risk of the loan not being sustainable  for Mr E.
Ref: DRN15966974With this in mind, Ive considered whether CashEuroNet  did enough to check  whether the 
loans were affordable.  And if I find it didnt, Ill go on to consider whether proportionate  
checks wouldve suggested  the loans were not affordable.
Bearing in mind what Ive said above,  I think proportionate checks  would vary in the 
circumstances of each  loan. So Ive looked at each loan individually using the evidence  
I have. In looking at each loan, I think its reasonable to say a responsible lender would 
require more assurance the greater the risk to the consumer of the loan being unsustainable. 
So, for example,  Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying  out more detailed 
checks:
the higher  the loan amount; and/or
the lower the consumers income;  and/or
the longer  the lending relationship
the lending gap
The two year gap between Loans 2 and 3 was long enough for me to think that 
CashEuroNet was reasonable to approach Mr Es application for Loan 3 as if he was a new 
customer. And I have  incorporated this into my findings. 
the key procedures document 
As I have already  outlined in the background section,  CashEuroNet  has said it isnt 
prepared to agree to our adjudicators opinion that Loans 7 to 14 should be upheld because 
they were loans it approved after March 2015.  CashEuroNet sent us its key procedures 
document and seems  to be saying that because it reviewed its processes  and incorporated 
regulatory changes  as it was required to, all loans for all customers granted from 
March 2015 onwards were granted responsibly and its checks  were always proportionate.
I dont agree with this argument. It doesnt follow that a firm cannot  have treated any 
consumer unfairly simply because it has been authorised  and is regulated by the FCA. The 
FCA isnt prescriptive about what checks a lender should carry out. And I do point out that 
this service has responded to CashEuroNet on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on it any further here, though I have  
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision.
the CashEuroNet submissions
I refer to Table A. The deliberate juxtaposition  of the two sets of figures  from CashEuroNet 
arrived at by two different  methods of calculating Mr Es EDI demonstrates  several points 
which need to be addressed here. 
Firstly, for most of the loans after 2015 the EDI figures differ and yet we have  been  given 
these figures by CashEuroNet to defend  the complaint, the only difference being time. The 
first set of submissions was received in November 2017 and the second set almost a year 
later in September 2018. It seems  to be unexplained as to why the later calculation  of the 
EDI differed. 
Secondly, the CRA validated figures  are presented to us by CashEuroNet with no evidence 
to substantiate  them. We have not been  sent the CRA results  from which  these figures have 
been taken. 
Ref: DRN15966975Thirdly, the EDI calculations are so different, particularly from Loan  10, that this leads me to 
doubt both sets of figures and so I do not feel able to rely on either.  
Fourthly, CashEuroNets own key procedures document has said that where  a discrepancy 
arose in relation to financial figures  it says it would have asked the customer for his or her 
bank account  statements  to further  check. In Mr Es case, for several loans I can see that 
there were discrepancies.  I am referring  to the differences between the CashEuroNet 
spreadsheet information for Mr Es declared  credit commitment information and the CRA 
validated credit figures presented to us in September 2018. I have set these out below in 
Table B using the figures CashEuroNet  has given me. None were given in relation to 
Loans 1 and 2. 
These different  figures led in turn to very different EDI figures  and would have had an impact  
on the lending  decision.

12 £150 £150 £1,141
13 £150 £342 £949
14 £25 £712 £487
And yet it does not seem to have been  the case  that CashEuroNet  sought or obtained the 
bank statements from Mr E. Or if they have  been  asked for or received by it I have not been 
given these as part of this complaint. 
All in all it leads me to proceed with relatively  little confidence in the figures  presented to 
show me CRA validated  credit commitment checks CashEuroNet carried out and the 
resulting EDI figures. And I think that this applies  especially  when these differ from the very 
figures CashEuroNet put forward  as being Mr Es EDI the year before. 
Loans 1 to 6
Loans 1 and 2 were  when  the OFT guidance  was in place and I have referred to that above. 
As I do not have all the information I expected to have received and we have asked  for from 
Mr E, and I have received  no explanation  from Mr E or his representative  as to why Mr E 
disagrees with our adjudicators opinion for Loans  1 and 2 then I have decided to come to 
the same  conclusions as out adjudicator. I do not uphold Mr Es complaint for Loans 1 and 2.
Loans 3 to 6 are ones where  I have  established that I am not satisfied  that the figures I have 
received from CashEuroNet are able to be relied  on. Ordinarily  I would  turn to the 
Ref: DRN15966976information from Mr E to help me come to a conclusion. As I do not have all the information 
I expected to have  received and we have asked for from Mr E, and I have received no 
explanation from Mr E or his representative  as to why Mr E disagrees with our adjudicators 
opinion for Loans  3 to 6 then I cannot take it much  further forward.  
I have looked  at Mr Es credit file for this period and I can see that he had other  short-term  
loans with other lenders around  this time.  But I can also see that he had declared to 
CashEuroNet when  making the applications  that his income was around £1,299 for Loans 3 
and 4, and around  £1,768 for Loans  5 and 6. So without the additional information from Mr E 
I am not able to make a proper  assessment in order to help me reach a fair and reasonable 
outcome. So I do not uphold  Mr Es complaint in relation to Loans 3 to 6. 
Loans 7 to 14
The information about the loans  that I do have, plus Mr Es credit file, leads me to come  to 
some conclusions. The Loan 7 application  was the fifth loan application in four months, and 
it was applied for immediately after repaying  Loan 6. Also, it was the largest sum applied for 
to date and was six times larger  than the loan applied for at the beginning of this loan chain 
(April 2015). 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which CashEuroNet should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Es case, I think  that this point 
was reached by Loan 7. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr E was borrowing were generally  increasing, and CashEuroNet ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably
Mr E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount they owed lender. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period
I think that Mr E lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from Loan  7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Es 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Es complaint about  Loans  7 to 14 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 7 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 7 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 7 to 14 should  be removed from Mr Es credit 
file
Ref: DRN15966977CashEuroNet can set off the monies it owes Mr E from the outstanding balance  on Loan 14. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet  to take off tax from this interest. It must 
give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. Any set-off 
needs to be done after tax. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Es 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  do as I have set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mr E to accept or reject 
my final determination  on or before 27 April 2019
