The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) has rejected the claim 
they made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in 
relation to a solar panel system they say was misrepresented to them by the supplier.
Mr and Mrs C are represented by a claims management company (the CMC).
Background
In or around October 2015, Mr and Mrs C were contacted by a representative of a company 
Ill call P to talk about purchasing a solar panel system (the system) to be installed at their 
home. After being visited by a representative of P, Mr and Mrs C decided to purchase the 
system and finance it through a 15 year fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook. The 
system was subsequently installed.
In November 2015 the CMC made a claim to Shawbrook on Mr and Mrs Cs behalf under 
section 75 of the Act. The CMC said that, following a cold call, P had made a number of 
representations about the system that had turned out not to be true, and it was these 
misrepresentations that had induced Mr and Mrs C to enter into the contract with P. The 
CMC said the following misrepresentations had been made:
the system would generate free electricity, which they could sell back to the National 
Grid;
the system would be self-funding; and
the feed in tariff (FIT) and savings on their electricity bills would provide enough 
income to cover the finance agreement repayments costs.
The CMC also complained that Shawbrook had paid P commission for brokering the loan.
Shawbrook issued a final response and explained that it didnt agree the system had been 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs C or that there were any other reasons for the claim to be 
upheld. However it offered £200 compensation for its delay in responding to the complaint.
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that P had misrepresented 
the system to Mr and Mrs C and found no reason to uphold the complaint.
The CMC didnt agree with the adjudicators view for the following reasons:
the sales documentation on which the adjudicator had relied, specifically the quote, 
was confusing and inconsistent and had been sent to Mr and Mrs C without any 
explanation of what it all meant;
being satisfied with what they had been told in the sales meeting, Mr and Mrs C had 
not thought it necessary to rely on the quote. The CMC expected that this would be 
supported by the audit log for the electronic signing of the quote, which would show 
that they had signed it immediately and not taken the time to read it. For this reason 
the CMC asked to be sent a copy of the audit log.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Relevant considerations
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant 
time. In this case the relevant law includes sections 56, 75 and 140A of the Act.
Section 75 provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. As 
Mr and Mrs C paid for the system with a fixed sum loan agreement, Shawbrook agrees that 
section 75 applies to this transaction. This means that Mr and Mrs C could claim against 
Shawbrook (the creditor) for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by P in the same 
way they could have claimed against P (the supplier). So Ive taken section 75 into account 
when deciding what is fair in the circumstances of this case.
Section 140A is about unequal relationships between the parties to a credit agreement. In 
this case, the CMC relies on the alleged misrepresentation of the system, and also on the 
possibility that Shawbrook paid P commission or gave P some other financial incentive to 
broker the loan.
Section 56 is also relevant. This is because it says that any negotiations between Mr and 
Mrs C and P, as the supplier, are deemed to have been conducted by P as an agent of 
Shawbrook.
For the purpose of this decision Ive used the definition of a misrepresentation as an untrue 
statement of fact or law made by one party (or his agent) to a second party which induces 
that second party to enter the contract, thereby causing them loss.
What happened?
If there is a dispute about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities  
that is, what I consider to have been most likely to have happened, given the evidence that 
is available and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Mr and Mrs C say that during a sales meeting they were told that the system would be 
entirely self-financing and come at no additional cost.
There are several documents that have been provided by both the CMC and Shawbrook. 
These include the credit agreement and solar quote, titled Your Personal Solar Quotation. 
Ive considered these, along with Mr and Mrs Cs testimony and recollection of the sales 
meeting, to decide on balance what is most likely to have happened.
The quote is a detailed document that sets out key information about the system, the 
expected performance, financial benefits and technical information. P, via Shawbrook, has 
told this service that this formed a central part of the sales process and the representative of 
P would have discussed this in detail with Mr and Mrs C, explaining any benefits of the 
system, prior to them agreeing to enter into the contract. 
Having thought carefully about the available evidence, Im satisfied that on balance the 
quote did form a central part of the sales process and therefore accept that the salesperson 
went through it during the meeting. So, Ive taken this into account, along with Mr and Mrs Cs version of events, when considering if there have been any untrue statements of 
fact. If Mr and Mrs C did not read it, then that was their choice, but this evidence is mainly 
relevant to the issue of what P told them and whether the salesman is likely to have told 
them something significantly different to what the quote says. I have therefore not 
considered it necessary to obtain the audit log to see how long Mr and Mrs C spent reading 
it before they signed it.
The credit agreement sets out the amount being borrowed (i.e. the cash price of the system), 
the interest to be charged, the total amount payable, the term of the loan and the contractual 
monthly repayments.
FIT payments and savings
Mr and Mrs C have said that they were told their monthly loan repayments would be 
covered, or self-funded by the FIT payments. Ive considered the quote that was provided 
by P as well as Mr and Mrs Cs recollections of their meeting with Ps representative to 
decide what is most likely to have been said.
The system analysis page of the quote sets out the estimated income Mr and Mrs C could 
expect to receive by way of FIT payments from the system. This is split out into the expected 
FIT payments in the first year and the expected average income over 20 years. The FIT 
scheme only provides payments for a 20-year period.
I think that the first of these tables is clear that Mr and Mrs C could expect to receive a total 
FIT income in year one of £287.66, which results in an average monthly income of £23.97. 
Im satisfied that the same document set out that there would be a monthly loan repayment 
due of £91.04. As a result, Im not able to conclude that Mr and Mrs C were told that the 
monthly loan repayments would be covered by the FIT payments.
The quote goes on to look at the electricity savings Mr and Mrs C could expect from the 
system. The expected year one electricity savings is £225.52 and, when taking into account 
the optional extras chosen by Mr and Mrs C, the combined income and savings in year one 
is shown as £679.85. This is shown in a table titled Putting it all together.
Theres a section headed Repayments with three tables showing repayments over 60 
months, 120 months and 180 months. Ive focused on the table for 180 months as this is the 
length of the loan that Mr and Mrs C entered into with Shawbrook. This table shows the loan 
as repayable in 180 monthly payments of £91.04. (This is incorrect; the loan agreement 
gives the correct monthly figure of £92.54, but the difference  £1.50  is too small to affect 
the following observations.) For each year of the 15 year loan it shows the expected grand 
total return from the system. It then averages that figure over 12 months, and subtracts the 
monthly loan repayment of £91.04, to give an average difference between the monthly return 
from the system and the monthly loan repayment in each year. This gives a negative figure 
for the first eight years of the loan, meaning that the system would take eight years to begin 
to make enough money to cover the loan payments.
I think the quote clearly sets out the income Mr and Mrs C could expect to receive from the 
system, by way of FIT payments and savings, as well as their expected contractual monthly 
loan repayments. Whilst I accept that the table doesnt simply compare the FIT income and 
savings to the monthly loan repayments, it does clearly set out that the overall income they 
could expect to receive by way of FIT income and any additional savings would not be 
immediately sufficient to cover the monthly loan repayments. This supports my finding above 
that Mr and Mrs C werent told that the FIT payments would cover the loan repayments. Ive 
carefully thought about Mr and Mrs Cs version of events. However, as Ive found that the 
quote did form a central part of the sales process which the salesperson went through at the 
meeting, I dont think I can reasonably find that they were told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT income alone.
I am reinforced in my view by this graph, which was also in the quote and which plainly 
showed that the system would not be enough to cover the loan payments. The orange line 
shows the monthly loan payments, and the blue and green lines show FIT income and 
savings.
Self-funding
Ill now consider whether P told Mr and Mrs C that the system would be self-funding from the 
outset. In doing so Ill again weigh all the available evidence to decide what is most likely to 
have happened.
Bearing in mind my finding on the central role the quote played in the sales meeting, Ive 
considered the table above which sets out the estimated average monthly income from the 
system, and the effect on that income of subtracting the monthly loan repayment. Im 
satisfied that the table is clear and easy to understand (notwithstanding the £1.50 
discrepancy in the monthly payments). That section of the quote has been signed by Mr C, 
so Im satisfied that P did enough to bring it to his attention. On balance Im also satisfied 
that the salesperson referred to the table at the meeting.
As a result, I consider the salesperson did not make a representation that the system would 
be self-funding from the outset. Rather, I find that the salesperson went through the quote at 
the meeting which sets out there would be a difference between the expected income and 
the monthly loan repayments.
Im of the view that this makes it clear that the system wouldnt be self-funding from the start. 
I think the quote is clear that there would be a difference between the expected income and 
monthly loan repayments.
That said, I do accept that Mr and Mrs C were told by P that the system would be self-
funding over a certain period of time.
The Key Facts page of the quote has a graph detailing the estimated performance over 20 
years. This shows that it would take 10 years for the overall benefits that Mr and Mrs C could 
expect to receive to match the cash price of the system.
I think the 10-year estimated payback time is clear and prominent, being in large print on 
page 2, and so I dont consider that it was confusing or that it needed further explaining. 
I would not necessarily expect Mr and Mrs C to have read the small print at the bottom, but 
that only clarifies that it would have taken 10 years to cover the cash price of the system 
rather than the cost of the finance.
A later page of the quote has a table detailing the estimated performance of the system over 
20 years. This shows that during year 16 the overall benefits that Mr and Mrs C could expect 
to receive would have reached the total amount payable under the loan agreement, £16,657.
As Ive set out above, Im satisfied that P told Mr and Mrs C that the system would pay for its 
cash price in 10 years, and for the loan in about 16 years, as supported by the graph and the 
table above, which were included in the quote. If that were an untrue statement of fact, and 
Im satisfied that this was what induced them to enter into the contract, and they 
subsequently suffered a loss, then that could amount to a misrepresentation.
Performance
Ive gone on to consider the performance of the system and whether this is in line with the 
contract between P and Mr and Mrs C. The MCS certificate and quote set out that the 
system is expected to produce 1,931 kWh a year.
I have looked at Mr and Mrs Cs FIT statements and can see that their system, on average, 
has generated 1,64 kWh a year. This is slightly more than estimated by P at the point of 
sale, so Im satisfied that the system is performing as expected.
I have also looked at the assumptions used by P, including the self-consumption rate, 
expected annual increase in utility prices (EPR) and expected annual RPI inflation increase. 
I am satisfied that Ps method for calculating these is fair and reasonable.
P used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data between 2005 and 2014 to calculate the 
utility price and RPI inflation. I have looked at the actual yearly increases between 2016 and 
2020, and the increases have been lower than predicted by P at the point of sale, and I think 
this explains why Mr and Mrs C havent been receiving the financial returns they may have 
been expecting from the solar panels. Since actual energy prices have been lower than the 
modelling predicted, the savings achieved through the energy generated by the system have 
been correspondingly lower.
As I have explained, the assumptions used by P were based on the information available 
from the ONS at the time. And based on this, I dont consider it unreasonable for P to have 
used them as the basis for calculating the potential financial income Mr and Mrs C could 
have expected to receive from the system. So, whilst I can appreciate that the returns may 
not have been as high as estimated at the point of sale, Im not persuaded that this was due 
to unreasonable assumptions being used by P at the time Mr and Mrs C entered into the 
contract.
Section 140A
I have seen no evidence that Shawbrook paid P excessive commission, and although 
Shawbrook did not address this point in its final response, it has denied doing so in other 
cases. I have no reason to doubt that denial, or to suppose that it acted differently in the 
case of Mr and Mrs Cs loan.
Summary
Having carefully considered the evidence provided by all parties in this complaint, Im
satisfied that there were no untrue statements of fact made by P that induced Mr and Mrs C 
to enter into the contract for the system, and I have found no other reason to uphold this 
complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
I leave it to Mr and Mrs C to decide whether to accept Shawbrooks offer of £200 
compensation for its delay in responding to their complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
