The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA kept cancelling his direct debit.
What happened
In November 2018, Mr S opened a credit account with PayPal. As part of the agreement, Mr 
S needed to pay the minimum payment each month by direct debit. So, Mr S set up a direct 
debit with his bank.
But the payments for March 2019 didnt go through because there wasnt a valid direct debit 
in place with Mr Ss bank. And a new direct debit wasnt set up until June 2019. Because of 
this, not all of the payments were made on time, and PayPal reported the missed payments 
to the credit reference agencies.
Mr S has complained that PayPal kept cancelling the direct debit, when he had enough 
money in his account to pay the minimum payment. And hes unhappy his credit file has 
been affected because of this.
Our investigator said PayPal had no control over the direct debit, and they could only act on 
what Mr Ss bank told them. As there wasnt a valid direct debit in place, PayPal couldnt 
collect the payments. She felt it was Mr Ss responsibility to ensure he had a valid method of 
payment in place, so she didnt think PayPal were responsible for the missed payments.
The investigator also said PayPal had acted reasonably by updating the credit reference 
agencies with the missed payments - they have a responsibility to ensure this information is 
accurate and up to date. So she didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigator. He says he should be able to trust two professional 
organisations  PayPal and his bank  to set up a direct debit correctly, and he questions 
how he could check that this had been done. Hes also questions why PayPal didnt just 
contact him to tell him there was a problem, instead of penalising him. He feels that an error 
between PayPal and his bank has impacted him negatively. So hes asked for an 
ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the evidence I agree with the investigators findings on this complaint for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
Firstly, I want to recognise the upset this situation has caused Mr S. Hes now in a position 
where he has a missed payment showing on his credit file, which he believes is as a result of 
an error between PayPal and his bank. But for me to agree that PayPal should correct Mr 
Ss credit file, Id need to be satisfied that their actions caused the direct debit to fail. And in 
this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive taken a look at the statements and payment history provided by both Mr S and PayPal. 
These show that the payments made on 14 January and 14 February 2019 were both 
minimum payments taken by direct debit. This shows me that the direct debit was set up 
correctly and was operating as planned  the minimum payment was being taken on the 
agreed date.
Once a direct debit is set up, the collecting organisation (in this case PayPal) cant do 
anything to alter this. If the direct debit is subsequently cancelled, the cancellation would 
have to be done by either the person paying the direct debit (in this case Mr S) or their bank.
And the statements show that the direct debits PayPal tried to collect on 14 March, 14 April 
and 15 May 2019 werent successful. This wouldve been because there wasnt enough 
money in the account to pay the direct debit; or the direct debit had been cancelled. And Mr 
S says there was always enough money in his account to cover the minimum payment.
So the direct debit mustve failed because it was cancelled. And the cancellation mustve 
been done by Mr S; or by Mr Ss bank without his knowledge. PayPal couldnt cancel the 
direct debit, so I cant hold them responsible for these payments not being collected.
On 21 March, PayPal told Mr S that his direct debit hadnt gone through and that he needed 
to make a payment. They also told him the same on 22 March, after theyd made a second 
unsuccessful attempt to collect payment. On 23 March, PayPal told Mr S that theyd applied 
a late payment fee to his account. They also told him that missing a payment could have a 
negative effect on his credit file.
Mr S made a manual payment of Â£27.71 on 1 April 2019. This amount covered the minimum 
payments for March and April 2019. But, because this was paid in April, Mr S didnt make 
any payment to his PayPal account in March 2019. PayPal have a responsibility to report 
accurate information to the credit reference agencies. So I dont think theyve done anything 
wrong by reporting that no payment was made in March 2019.
A new direct debit was set up in June 2019, and payments after this were all collected 
without any problems. Because of this I dont think PayPal have done anything wrong, and I 
wont be asking them to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl 
& Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 August 2020.
