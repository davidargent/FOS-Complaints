K820x#14complaint
Mr A and Mrs K have complained about  a mortgage they applied for through  a broker  that 
was an appointed representative of First Complete Ltd. They  say the mortgage  funds  were  
all sent to the vendor of the property, whereas £30,000 should have been kept back for Mr A 
and Mrs K as those funds  were for home improvements.
For ease Ill simply  refer to First Complete  throughout this decision, but that should  be taken 
to mean  the broker personally where  appropriate.
background
Mr A and Mrs K were  buying a property from a relative at a reduced purchase  price. The 
broker was told  and the mortgage  application  was made on the basis of  the property 
being worth  £280,000, with Mr A and Mrs K paying £115,000 for it. The remaining £165,000 
was said to be a gift from the vendor  (the relative) to Mr A and Mrs K. Mr A and Mrs K 
applied for - and were  granted  a mortgage of £145,000. They  said £115,000 was being 
used to buy the property, with the remaining £30,000 being  for home  improvements.
The mortgage completed but Mr A and Mrs Ks solicitor sent the entire £145,000 to the 
vendors solicitor and issued a completion statement noting the vendors gift to be £135,000 
rather than £165,000.
Mr A and Mrs K complained to First Complete saying the relative had refused to return the 
£30,000 and so they wanted compensation. They say they later managed to get £25,000  
back but remained £5,000 out of pocket. First Complete rejected the complaint  saying  it had 
no control over what the solicitor did with the funds,  it simply arranged the mortgage.
Our adjudicator didnt  think First Complete had done anything wrong for broadly the same  
reasons. Mr A and Mrs K didnt agree and so the matter has been  passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First Complete simply recommended  a suitable mortgage and placed that with the mortgage 
lender. Once the mortgage offer was produced  its role generally came to an end. It arranged 
a £145,000 mortgage on the basis that was £115,000 to buy the property and £30,000 for 
Mr A and Mrs Ks home improvements.  The mortgage offer was produced for a £145,000 
mortgage, and a £145,000 mortgage completed. So First Complete did everything it needed 
to do correctly. The mortgage offer didnt set out a breakdown of where the funds were  to go 
as that didnt form part of the mortgage contract; thats normal and as I would expect.
The responsibility for sending the funds to the right place(s) lays with the solicitors,  in this 
case Mr A and Mrs Ks solicitor. And the only people  who can give their solicitor instructions 
are Mr A and Mrs K; First Complete had no authority (or responsibility) to do so. It was down 
to Mr A and Mrs K to ensure their solicitor knew where the funds were due to go on 
completion.
Mr A and Mrs K have said First Complete told them the £30,000 would be paid to them,  and 
thats correct (if that was the legal  contract  they entered into with their brother).  But that 
Ref: DRN12418772money wouldnt have  been paid to them directly by the mortgage lender.  Mortgage  funds for 
a property purchase are always  released  in their entirety to the purchasers solicitor, and the 
solicitor is then responsible for sending them onto the right place(s).
In this case if things  had happened  as Mr A and Mrs K say they should,  then the lender 
would have sent £145,000 to Mr A and Mrs Ks solicitor, and their solicitor would have 
forwarded £115,000 to the vendor and £30,000  to Mr A and Mrs K. First Complete would 
have no input in that, and no control  over it. So if Mr A and Mrs K truly believe the funds 
were wrongly distributed then thats a matter  theyd need to take up with the solicitor  directly. 
Its got nothing  to do with First Complete.
As I can only consider  the actions of First Complete I cant  comment further on what the 
outcome of such a complaint would be as its not within  my power to do so. However, for 
completeness I would say that First Complete  has told us Mr A and Mrs Ks solicitor  has said 
Mr A and Mrs K signed a legally binding contract with the vendor which stated the gift was 
only £135,000  and the purchase price to be transferred was £145,000 which ties in with what 
actually happened.
Having considered everything  Im satisfied that First Complete did nothing  wrong, and that is 
the only party whose  actions I can look at here.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im 
required to ask Mr A and Mrs K to accept or reject my decision before 3 October 2019.
