The complaint
Mr C was a self-employed tradesman. He needed a large van to transport himself and bulky
materials to customers. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a large van, first registered in 2015.
Mr C bought the van in late September 2020 for about £12,000.00. It had a recorded
mileage of about 122,000. Mr C insured it, through a broker, on a comprehensive policy for
the year from 27 September 2020.
On 27 September 2021, the van passed an MOT test with a recorded mileage of about
135,000.
For the year from 27 September 2021, Mr C renewed the policy. The policy was branded
with the name of an insurance policy administrator. New India was ultimately responsible for
dealing with any claim.
Much of the complaint is about the acts and omissions of the administrator and its claims-
handlers. Insofar as I hold New India responsible for such acts or omissions, my references 
to New India may include the administrator and its claims-handlers.
On about 21 August 2022, Mr C reported that someone had stolen the van containing work
tools.
New India didnt provide any response to Mr Cs claim or further emails.
New Indias policy didnt cover the provision of a courtesy van.
On about 1 September 2022, the vans road tax expired.
Mr C hired a van from 19 to 23 September 2022 at a cost of £286.54.
Mr C wrote a letter to New India dated 25 September 2022, complaining about delay and
lack of response. He said he was unable to work. Mr Cs partner also sent a message to the
administrators Chief Executive Officer.
On about 26 September 2022, the insurance policy and the MOT expired.
On about 28 September 2022, New India received an independent engineers report. It said
the van had a recorded mileage of about 147,000. New India gave a pre-loss valuation for
the van.
Mr C disputed that valuation. On 18 October 2022, his partner messaged the CEO again.
She said that DVLA had fined Mr C £150.00 because he still owned the van.
On 20 October 2022, New India emailed a revised valuation including VAT. Mr C accepted
that. New India made payment.
By a final response dated 21 November 2022, New India apologised for an initial delay when
instructing the independent engineers and a second delay when forwarding Mr Cs dispute to
the engineers. New India offered Mr C £100.00. Mr C responded on 23 November 2022 
asking for more compensation and claiming loss of earnings for the period from 1 September 
2022 to 20 October 2022.
Having received no response, Mr C brought his complaint to us in mid-January 2023. He
asked us to direct New India to compensate him for loss of earnings.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that New
India had accepted there were two periods of delays, the first from 2 September 2022 to 27
September 2022 and the second from 29 September 2022 to 19 October 2022. She said
that because of the delays caused by New India, Mr C incurred a loss of earnings. Mr C had
provided evidence of what he earnt for the equivalent period in 2021.
The investigator recommended that New India should pay Mr C the following:
loss of earnings
21 days @ £240.00 £5.040.00
van hire costs £   286.54
compensation for not responding to Mr C £   100.00
total £5,426.54
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr C 
and to New India on 28 June 2023. I summarise my findings:
I wasnt minded to hold New India responsible for unreasonable delay. For that 
reason, I wasnt minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct New India to pay Mr C 
compensation for loss of use of a van.
In any event, Mr C hadnt told New India- but later told us- that hed hired a van for a 
week in September 2022. I considered that this showed that he could, and did, work 
after 1 September and before 20 October 2022. I considered that Mr C had fallen 
short of showing bank statements or other details of his actual earnings from work in 
September and October 2022.
New India was responsible for sustained failure properly to communicate with Mr C. 
The impact of that on him - at an already difficult time  included worry that New India 
wasnt going to pay his claim at all. 
Subject to any further information from Mr C or from New India, my provisional decision was 
that I upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct The New India Assurance Company 
Limited to pay Mr C (insofar as it hasnt already paid him) £250.00 for distress and 
inconvenience.
Mr C disagreed with the provisional decision. He says, in summary, that: Lack of communication fell below the agreed service level. This caused delay in the 
process of paying the claim, ultimately resulting in loss of earnings.
At the very least, New India should cover the £500.00 excess that he had to pay.
New India acknowledged receipt of the provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The theft of the van and the need to make a claim were, in my view, inevitably going to
cause Mr C distress and inconvenience. Also he had lost tools for his work.
New Indias final response included the following:
[The administrator] instructed the independent engineers on 27/09/2022 to
compile the engineers report. The valuation offer in line with the engineers report was
emailed to you on 28/09/2022. However, you emailed [the administrator] on
29/09/2022, advising you were disputing this offer. The information you provided for
the dispute process was not emailed to [the engineer] until 19/10/2022.

I apologise for the initial delay caused when instructing [the engineers] and the
second delay caused when forwarding your dispute to the independent engineers
Mr C and New India treated the initial delay as having started on 1 September 2022, when
he sent it evidence of his purchase of the van. However, I dont agree that New India had to
instruct its engineer that day. I wouldve found it reasonable for New India to instruct an
engineer within a few days after 1 September 2022. I consider that 27 September 2022 was
beyond a reasonable time.
I wouldve found it reasonable for the engineer and New India each to have taken a few days
to deal with the report. However, the engineer reported very promptly. Based on that report,
New India emailed its valuation to Mr C on 28 September 2022. So I consider that New India
made up for lost time to some extent.
The final response said that Mr C sent an email on 29 September 2022 to dispute the
valuation. But I havent seen any such email. Rather, New Indias system notes record the
receipt on 17 October 2022 of a General Mail letter form PH. So I accept New Indias
recent statement that Mr C responded to the offer by post. I accept New Indias statement
that it didnt receive his response until 17 October 2022.
New India emailed that response to the engineer and the engineer again responded
promptly. So New India emailed its offer including VAT on 20 October 2022.
Ive found that New India didnt receive Mr Cs response until 17 October 2022. So -
notwithstanding the apology in the final response  I dont hold New India responsible for 
delay in the period from 28 September 2022 to 20 October 2022.
In any event, New India had responded to the claim from about 21 August 2022 by making a
valuation that Mr C accepted within about two months. I have seen theft claims take much
longer than that.Overall, I dont hold New India responsible for unreasonable delay. For that reason, I dont 
find it fair and reasonable to direct New India to pay Mr C compensation for loss of use of a 
van.
In any event, Mr C hadnt told New India - but later told us- that hed hired a van for a week 
in September 2022. I consider that this shows that he could, and did, work after 1 September
and before 20 October 2022. I consider that Mr C has fallen short of showing bank 
statements or other details of his actual earnings from work in September and October 2022.
Nevertheless, Ive seen that New India was responsible for sustained failure properly to
communicate with Mr C. The impact of that on him - at an already difficult time - included
worry that New India wasnt going to pay his claim at all. 
Mr Cs response to the provisional decision
As Ive said, I dont hold New India responsible for unreasonable delay. In any event, Mr C 
hasnt taken the opportunity to provide further evidence of his loss of earnings in September 
and October 2022. So Im not persuaded that he suffered a loss of earnings or that New 
India caused such a loss. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct New India to pay 
compensation in relation to loss of earnings.
The policy documents said that there was a compulsory excess of £250.00 and a voluntary 
excess of £250.00. So in the event of a theft, Mr C would have an uninsured loss of £500.00.
Ive assessed compensation for distress and inconvenience in line with our guidelines and 
by reference to its impact on Mr C - notwithstanding that this doesnt equate to the amount of 
the excess. 
Putting things right
I conclude that £250.00 is fair and reasonable compensation for distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct The New India Assurance Company Limited to pay Mr C (insofar as it hasnt already
paid him) £250.00 for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2023.
