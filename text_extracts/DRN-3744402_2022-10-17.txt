The complaint
Mr H complains that Sainsburys Bank Plc unfairly cancelled his motor insurance policy.
Where I refer to Sainsburys, I refer to the above-named company and I include employees
and others insofar as I hold that company responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
In late January 2022, Mr H took out a policy for the year from 4 February 2022. Sainsburys
acted as an intermediary between him and a motor insurer or underwriter. Mr H was the
policyholder. The policy also covered a named driver.
Mr H wanted to pay the yearly premium by instalments. So he entered into a credit
agreement with Sainsburys.
After sending some communications (the details of which I will come to), Sainsburys
cancelled the policy with effect from 18 March 2022.
On about 21 March 2022, Mr H complained to Sainsburys that it hadnt properly
communicated what documents he needed to provide to keep the policy on foot.
Mr H has said that he had been uninsured for a short time, before he urgently arranged new
insurance through another provider.
By a final response dated late March 2022, Sainsburys turned down the complaint. It said it
had sent the following communications:
15 February 2022 letter to request documents at the underwriters request.
25 February 2022 letter to request documents at the underwriters request.
8 March 2022 letter saying that it would cancel the policy on 18 March 2022.
18 March 2022 letter confirming cancellation.
Mr H brought his complaint to us in early April 2022.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that
Sainsburys did enough to make Mr H aware of what they needed from him to pass to the
insurer to avoid cancellation of his insurance. She recommended that Sainsburys should:
1. remove the cancellation from the Motor Insurance Database;
2. remove record of the credit agreement;
3. pay Mr H £100.00 in compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the 
cancellation of his motor insurance.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr H  
and to Sainsburys on 20 September 2022. I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that Sainsburys had done enough to communicate with Mr H
about the driving licence details and the impending cancellation  and to invite him to
telephone.
In any event, Sainsburys was acting as an intermediary, and on behalf of the insurer. 
I would expect the insurer to be responsible for cancellation. So, unlike the 
investigator, I wasnt minded to find it fair and reasonable to hold Sainsburys 
responsible for the cancellation or its consequences, including distress and 
inconvenience.
Subject to any further information from Mr H or from Sainsburys, my provisional decision 
was that I didnt uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct Sainsburys Bank Plc to do any 
more in response to this complaint.
Mr H disagreed with the provisional decision. He says, in summary, that:
He confirmed that he received the documentation which he could see on the portal. 
He received no other communication from Sainsbury's in relation to his motor 
insurance policy.
Deleting documents on the portal is absurd and confusing.
The notice to provide documentation (ID) did not include any advice that that was 
what he needed to do. It said to turn overleaf, which was a blank page.
Sainsbury's have been consistently inconsistent in what they've said; and provided 
no evidence to him demonstrating they've attempted to contact him in between taking 
the policy out and the notice that would cancel in 10 days' time (apart from a letter 
which they said they deleted from the portal. They said they sent him letters, but he 
only received any in relation to the complaint, so their claim is false.
Sainsbury's hasnt met the following Outcome of the FCA's principles for treating 
customers fairly:
"Outcome 3: Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept 
appropriately informed before, during and after the point of sale."
Sainsburys hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a welcome letter, by which Sainsburys sent documents to Mr H. The documentsincluded a statement of fact recording that Mr H had nine years no claims discount.
The documents show that the total amount expected to be paid was as follows:
Car premium £362.99
Legal premium £  12.99
Cost of credit £  43.93
Set-up fee £  40.00
Total £459.91
The car premium was equivalent to about £1.00 per day.
Mr H paid a deposit or initial payment of £83.20 and agreed to pay an instalment of £34.21
on 3 March 2022 and ten subsequent instalments of £34.25 (a total of £459.91).
The documents included the Sainsburys terms of business. Those terms included a
statement that, in arranging and maintaining cover, Sainsburys was acting as agent of the
insurer.
The terms also said that there would be a fee of £55.00 in the event of cancellation after 14
days.
Ive seen a letter dated 15 February 2022, by which Sainsburys asked Mr H for a driving
licence and a full DVLA driving licence summary for him and the named driver. The letter
said that if Sainsburys didnt receive the documents within the following seven days, it might
cancel the policy.
I accept that Sainsburys put the letter dated 15 February 2022 on the portal on that date.
Ive also seen a letter dated 25 February 2022, by which Sainsburys again asked Mr H for
the driving licence documents. The letter again said that if Sainsburys didnt receive the
documents within the following seven days, it might cancel the policy.
I accept that Sainsburys put the letter dated 25 February 2022 on the portal on that date, in 
place of the letter dated 15 February 2022.
Ive also seen a letter dated 8 March 2022, by which Sainsburys gave ten days notice of
cancellation of the insurance on 18 March 2022.
The letter of 8 March didnt ask for licence details. And I find that Sainsburys put that letter
on the portal on that date in place of the letters dated 15 and 25 February 2022. So the
portal incorrectly implied that the letter of 8 March dated from 15 February. And the portal no
longer showed the requests for licence information.
But the letter dated 8 March 2022 concluded as follows:
What to do now
If you have any questions about your cancellation, give us a ring on 0345 266
1670. Were open 9am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday and closed Saturday and
Sunday. If we dont hear from you then the cancellation will go ahead and your
Car will be uninsured from 18th March 2022.
The letter dated 8 March 2022 had the following words:
Please turn over - page 1 of 2But that was after the signature and at the foot of the page. So it looks like some wording 
included by mistake. And the letter had invited Mr H to ring if he had any questions. So I 
dont consider that the letter treated Mr H unfairly.
Ive also seen a letter dated 18 March 2022, by which Sainsburys confirmed cancellation of
the policy. It also said that the calculation of the refund was as follows:
DD Balance £308.21
Less refund car premium £321.23
Less refund legal premium £  11.50
Refund to Mr H £  24.52
Of the total of £459.91, Mr H had paid the deposit of £83.20 and the instalment of £34.21. So 
on the face of it, he had yet to pay ten direct debit instalments of £34.25 (£342.50). 
I havent seen a calculation of the balance of £308.21, but its lower than £342.50. So I find it 
likely that the cost of credit had been reduced from £43.93 because of early termination.
I find that the refunds of premium were set by the insurers rather than by Sainsburys. The
car refund was £321.23, about £41.76 less than the car premium of £362.99. Mr H had been
on cover from 4 February to 18 March 2022, about 42 days. Similarly, the £11.50 refund for
legal cover was the lions share of the premium of £12.99. So I havent seen enough
evidence to say that Sainsburys treated Mr H unfairly by the refund of £24.52.
Mr H received and responded to the letter dated 18 March 2022.
Whilst I cannot entirely rule out the possibility of error, I find it more likely that Sainsburys
sent the letters dated 15 and 25 February and 8 and 18 March 2022 by post on their
respective dates, as well as putting them on the portal and sending an email inviting Mr H to
log in.
Whilst I cant say that Mr H received or read any of the letters until after the cancellation on
18 March 2022, Im satisfied that Sainsburys had done enough to communicate with Mr H
about the driving licence details and the impending cancellation  and to invite him to
telephone.
In any event, Sainsburys was acting as an intermediary, and on behalf of the insurer. I
would expect the insurer to be responsible for cancellation. So, unlike the investigator, I dont 
find it fair and reasonable to hold Sainsburys responsible for the cancellation or its 
consequences, including distress and inconvenience.
From what its said, I find it likely that Sainsburys recorded the credit agreement as having
been terminated. Unlike the investigator, I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct 
Sainsburys to remove or alter the record of the credit agreement.
Overall, I dont conclude that Sainsburys treated Mr H unfairly. So I dont find it fair and 
reasonable to direct Sainsburys to do any more in response to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Sainsburys Bank Plc to do any more in response to this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2022.
