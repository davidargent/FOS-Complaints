The complaint
Mrs L is complaining that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has offset some of the 
compensation it offered her for its mis-sale of payment protection insurance (PPI) against 
debts which it says still remained outstanding after completion of Mrs Ls individual voluntary 
arrangement (IVA) in March 2017.
What happened
In June 2018, NatWest offered Mrs L compensation totalling £4,032.87 for its mis-sale of PPI 
to her. In its offer letter NatWest included the following statement:
If you are, or have been, subject to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), Protected
Trust Deed, Bankruptcy or Sequestration, any payment we make will be made to the 
relevant account. Any disbursements due to you under the terms of the arrangement will 
then be managed by the Groups Insolvency Team.
Following Mrs Ls acceptance of the offer, NatWest wrote to Mrs L in August 2018 enclosing 
a cheque for £1,961.90. It said that the balance of the offer made to her of £2,070.97 had 
been credited to its Debt Management Operations (DMO) in relation to outstanding arrears 
on her accounts with the bank. 
NatWest says that these arrears were the subject of an individual voluntary arrangement 
(IVA) which Mrs L entered into in 2012. And at the conclusion of the IVA, in 2017, it says 
there remained an outstanding debt owed to it by Mrs L of £2,070.97. So it set-off the 
compensation it had offered Mrs L against this outstanding debt before sending her the net 
payment of £1,961.90.
In September 2018, NatWests DMO issued a cheque to Mrs L for the £2,070.97 in error. But 
it sent this to an old address which it had for Mrs L where she was no longer living. As a 
result, Mrs L didnt receive the cheque. Mrs L subsequently chased NatWest for this 
payment. But once NatWest realised it had issued the cheque in error, it cancelled the 
cheque and made no further payment to Mrs L. 
Mrs L complained to NatWest about not receiving the amount which she considered was still 
due to her. NatWest responded to this further complaint in July 2019. It apologised for the 
administrative error it made in issuing a cheque for £2,070.97 made out to Mrs L, rather than 
retaining this part of the original PPI offer it made to offset against debts which remained 
outstanding following completion of her IVA. It offered Mrs L £100 for any distress and 
inconvenience which it had caused Mrs L as a result of the way it had handled her 
complaint.
Mrs L still didnt think NatWest had treated her fairly. She says she didnt have any 
outstanding debts with NatWest following the successful completion of her IVA in 2017 so 
she doesnt think that NatWest should withhold any of its original offer to her. She thinks that 
NatWest should honour the payment it sent to her in 2018 which she never received and 
which it now says was sent out in error. So she complained to this service about what 
NatWest had done.
Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought that what NatWest had done was fair. 
As Mrs L doesnt agree with the adjudicators view, the case has been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has agreed it mis-sold the PPI to Mrs L, so I dont need to look at how this was 
sold. And Mrs L hasnt complained about the total amount NatWest has offered to her in 
compensation, so I havent looked at this either. 
In this decision, Ive only looked at whether it was fair for NatWest to use some of the 
compensation its offered to Miss L to reduce the outstanding debt it says remained following 
the conclusion of her IVA and only pay her the residual amount it says was due to her of 
£1,961.90.
Having done so, I think NatWest has acted fairly, so Im not upholding Mrs Ls complaint. I 
know this will come as a disappointment for Mrs L, so I would like to take this opportunity to 
explain why.
 
When Mrs L entered into her IVA in 2012, the debts she owed werent legally cancelled or 
written off, they were effectively frozen. So the debts didnt cease to exist when the IVA was 
successfully completed in 2017.
 
NatWest has provided evidence to show that when the IVA came to an end their remained 
outstanding debts owed to it by Mrs L of £2,070.97.  Mrs L entering an IVA and then 
successfully completing it meant, by law, she couldnt subsequently be chased for this debt. 
But the debt Miss L has with NatWest does still exist  because it hasnt been paid back in 
full.
 
NatWest is still out of pocket for this money. And it isnt pursuing Mrs L for the debt. It has 
accepted it owes Mrs L money for the PPI compensation, so it owes her a debt. And it is 
setting off part of this debt for the PPI compensation against the debt Mrs L owed for the 
outstanding balances which remain on her loan accounts which still exist. 
There is in law what is called the equitable right to set off which allows people to set-off 
closely connected debts. This means one person (A) can deduct from a debt they owe 
another person (B), money which that person (B) owes to them.
 
I appreciate Mrs L completed her IVA some years ago - and can understand why she might 
think that completing her IVA meant the outstanding debt she had with NatWest was 
effectively extinguished. And Mrs L would be correct in as much as an IVA is a formal 
process which she did successfully complete. So Mrs L had the protection of the IVA which 
meant she didn't have to fully pay back all her creditors and then, subsequently, couldn't be 
legally pursued for any amounts still outstanding following completion of the IVA.
In this case, NatWest cant pursue Mrs L for her outstanding loan debts. But I think it would 
be unfair to tell NatWest to pay Mrs L all the PPI compensation when Mrs L no longer has to 
pay NatWest the monies she borrowed and never fully repaid. If NatWest paid all the 
compensation directly to Mrs L, shed be receiving compensation for PPI premiums that were added to loans and which she never, effectively, paid for in the first place. And I dont 
think that would be fair.
Ive also thought about the error NatWest made in sending Mrs L a cheque for the amount it 
required to offset her residual debts. But I dont think it would be fair for me to now direct 
NatWest to reinstate this payment to Mrs L. Im satisfied that NatWest were entitled to 
deduct outstanding debts from the compensation offer it made Mrs L. And I can see that it 
advised Mrs L that it was entitled to do this in the original offer letter it sent her. So I dont 
think that Mrs L has lost out because she wasnt able to cash a cheque that NatWest sent to 
her in error. 
I have, however, noted that NatWest offered £100 in compensation - paid directly to Mrs L - 
for the way it has handled her complaint. This includes the fact that she wasnt properly 
informed about what NatWest had done when she chased it for payment. And I think this is 
fair in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ls complaint because I consider it to have 
been fair for NatWest to use some of the compensation it owed Mrs L to reduce her 
outstanding debt. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2020.
