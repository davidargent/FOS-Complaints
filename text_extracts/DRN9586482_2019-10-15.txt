irresponsibly.
Background

and September  2016. Ive included some  of the information weve received about these 
loans in the table below.

Some of Mr Gs loans overlapped with one another. Where this was the case, the
repayment column includes the total of any overlapping repayments on loans outstanding 
at that point.
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint and thought loans 6 to 10 shouldnt have been given to 
Mr G. Sunny  disagreed  and the complaint has now been passed  to me to deal with. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Mr Gs applications  for borrowing  to check  if he could afford  to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Gs income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr G. These factors include:
Ref: DRN95864822Mr G having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr G having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr G coming  back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid (also  
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr G.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr G could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr G was able to repay  his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  and earlier guidance  from the Office  of Fair Trading 
(OFT) state payments  are sustainable  if they are made without undue difficulties and in 
particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable  commitments and without having 
to borrow to make them.  If a lender realises,  or ought reasonably  to have realised, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows  
that it should conclude those repayments  are unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
I think Sunnys checks were proportionate  for loans  1 to 3 and loan 11. Ive not seen 
evidence that Sunny was aware  of anything which might have meant Mr G would struggle to 
repay them. There was a long break in borrowing between loans 10 and 11 in which Mr G 
didnt return for further borrowing from Sunny. So I think  its possible  Mr Gs circumstances 
mayve improved during  this period.  Based on the information Mr G provided about his 
income and expenditure, these loans appeared to be affordable and I dont find Sunny was 
wrong to approve  them.
I think Sunny  should have  carried  out more detailed checks from loan 4. This is because a 
concerning pattern was emerging in Mr Gs borrowing with Sunny, of him taking multiple 
loans at the same time. Also, loan 4 was his eighth  advance in around 13 months. In my 
view, this should have prompted a more thorough analysis of his financial situation before  
agreeing further  loans.  But I dont  think wouldve made a difference.  I say this because  
having looked at Mr Gs bank statements, I think its unlikely Sunny would have thought  the 
loan was unaffordable, had it carried out more  thorough checks.
Ref: DRN95864823However, having looked at Mr Gs overall pattern of borrowing, I agree with our adjudicator 
that by loan 6, Sunny  shouldve reasonably seen that Mr G was unlikely to have been able to 
make his loan repayments in a sustainable  way. I say this because  although the amounts Mr 
G was borrowing on individual loans fluctuated over time, his overall  indebtedness  did not 
significantly change,  and there  were  no sizable gaps in his borrowing which  could have 
suggested his financial situation had improved. 
At the point Mr G applied  for loan 6, Mr G had demonstrated a pattern of persistent 
borrowing. Loan 1 had featured multiple  drawdowns over a period of about eight months, 
while loans 2, 3 and 4 had all run at the same  time,  totalling £850 (more than Mr G had ever 
drawn down on loan 1). After repaying these  loans Mr G had returned for another  loan within  
a short  space of time,  and then applied for loan 6, which was for more than twice  that 
amount, while  loan 5 was outstanding.
It should have  been apparent to Sunny that Mr Gs overall  indebtedness  was increasing 
again and his borrowing history shows this same  pattern continued up until loan 10. Mr G 
had been borrowing from Sunny for around  15 months at the time he applied for loan 6 and 
he had been indebted for around 11 of those months. Mr G being indebted to Sunny for this 
period of time, in these circumstances, was in my view an indication of an underlying, longer-
term financial problem. But I can see Sunny continued to approve loans, extending the 
period of borrowing in this chain to 22 months.  The intended purpose of these loans  was to 
cover a short-term financial need.  But Sunny prolonged Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
In light of the above, I dont think it was right for Sunny to continue lending  to Mr G from loan 
6 onwards, until he took a significant break in his borrowing  prior to loan 11. 
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr G loans 6 to 10, so its not right that he should have had to 
pay interest, fees or charges on these loans. And because  Sunny should have concluded it 
was irresponsible  to lend to Mr G loans 6 to 10, I dont think its fair that these loans  should  
impact his credit file at all.
So to put things right I direct Sunny  to:
A)Add together the amount Mr G has paid in interest, fees and charges on loans 
6 to 10.
B)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  considered as part 
of A, calculated from the date Mr G originally  made  the payments to the date 
the complaint  is settled.
C)Pay the total of A plus B to Mr G.
D)Remove loans 6 to 10 from Mr Gs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take tax off this interest. Sunny must give Mr G 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off, if Mr G asks for one.
My final decision
Ref: DRN95864824I uphold Mr Gs complaint and direct Elevate Credit  international  Limited  to take the actions 
set out in the putting  things right section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 November  2019.
