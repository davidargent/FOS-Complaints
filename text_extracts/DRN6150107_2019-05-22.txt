CEN looked at Mr Hs initial complaint. It said that the checks it made  were  reasonable and 
all the loans appeared affordable. But it felt that it couldve done more  before approving  
loans 1a to loan 4. This was largely  because  Mr H had loans with QuickQuid and Pounds to 
Pocket running at the same time. 
It thought it had made proportionate checks before approving loan 5 and its top ups. And 
that these checks  showed  the lending was affordable and so it was appropriate to lend to Mr 
H. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld this complaint. He agreed with the offer the business  had 
made in respect  of loans 1a to loan 4. He also thought that the checks QuickQuid made  
before approving loans 5a to 5b werent  proportionate. And if QuickQuid  had done  more 
these checks wouldve shown that Mr H couldnt afford to sustainably repay this lending. 
CEN disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN61501072Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Hs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Hs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr H didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 and 5. Because  of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about them. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr H had with CEN. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
my findings for loans  about loans 1a to 4
Ive carefully thought  about what CEN and Mr H have provided and what  both sides  have 
said. 
And there also doesnt now seem to be any disagreement about loans 1a to 4. I agree that 
CEN shouldnt have approved these loans. When the lending  from both parts of the business 
is added  to together it is a significant amount over a long period. This was a clear indication 
that Mr H was in financial  difficulty  which CEN  shouldve been aware of. So CEN shouldnt 
have approved these loans.   
my findings about loans 5a and 5b
As our adjudicator said,  QuickQuid didnt update Mr Hs income  before approving this loan. 
The information its provided to me shows that the latest income amount it had was from 
over two years earlier. So its not unreasonable to use the amount Mr H provided a few 
months after the loan started of just under £1,200. And this is close to what  Mr H actually 
earned. 
Ref: DRN61501073QuickQuid also doesnt seem to have asked Mr H about his expenditure. It had recorded  an 
amount of just over £300 a few months earlier and Pounds  to Pocket had recorded just over 
£500 around the same time. And Mr H would tell QuickQuid that his expenses  were over 
£700 a few months later.
So given the uncertainty about his income and expenditure I dont think  QuickQuid made 
proportionate checks. Having looked at the information Mr H has provided I cant  accurately 
say what his expenditure was. So I think its reasonable  to assume that his outgoings were 
somewhere between £500  and 700. This gives Mr H a disposable income of around £600  
per month. 
Loan 5a was due to be repaid over a two month  period. But Mr H needed to make total 
repayments of around £1,050 into this loan. Mr H borrowed over half of his income and the 
final highest repayment was much higher than his disposable income. So I dont think  it was 
reasonable to assume that Mr H could sustainably  repay this lending given the information it 
had. So I dont think it should have approved this loan. 
It follows that I also dont  think it was likely that Mr H could sustainably repay loan 5b which 
was an increase in the borrowing again.  So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about  loans 5a to 
5b. 
What CEN  should  do to put things right
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 1a to 4 and loans 5a and 5b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 1a to 4 and loans 5a and 5b from 
Mr Hs credit file;
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If Mr H still owes  CEN  any of the principal balance  he borrowed on his final loan CEN should  
remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance. CEN should  then re-
work the account  as if all payments made by Mr H went to towards the principal. But 
importantly, CEN needs to make sure that Mr H doesnt repay more than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr H hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed CEN can deduct this from the 
remainder of the compensation. If, Mr H has already paid enough to repay the principal  then 
any overpayment should be refunded  to him with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement. 
And if CEN no longer owns this debt,  and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount  
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr H.
Ref: DRN61501074my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
