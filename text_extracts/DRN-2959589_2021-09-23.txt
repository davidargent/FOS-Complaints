The complaint

STF has told us that there are outstanding balances due for the final two loans. 
The adjudicator didnt think STF had made an error when it approved loans 1  5. However, 
she did conclude that, based on what she saw, STFs checks needed to go further for loans 
4 and 5. 
The adjudicator also concluded that by loan 6 STF ought to have realised the pattern of 
lending was harmful to Mrs R. So, loans 6 - 25 shouldnt have given. 
Mrs R appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, STF said;
it didnt do anything wrong and it adhered to all regulations and guidance 
at the time when the loans were granted, STF didnt have technology to keep copies 
of documents that it saw  for example bank statements and 
STF reiterated it didnt uphold Mrs Rs complaint, but the offer it made to wipe the 
outstanding balances was still available to her. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mrs R (or her representative) dont appear to have disagreed with our adjudicators findings 
about loans 1  5. So, I think there is no longer a dispute about these loans. And like the 
adjudicator, I would also agree that there doesnt appear to be anything in the information 
that STF gathered which suggested Mrs R couldnt afford the lending (albeit further checks 
may have been needed when loans 4 and 5 were granted). So instead, this decision will 
focus on whether STF did anything wrong when it lent loans 6 to 25.  
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs R could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mrs R. These factors include: 
Mrs R having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mrs R having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs R coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs R. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.At the time these loans were lent, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mrs Rs complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 25 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. Based, on what STF has given us though, it seems it only has 
limited or sporadic information from loan 18 about the terms, weekly cost and the information 
Mrs R gave. Whereas, quite a lot of detail was provided for loans 1  17. 
I can also see for some of the loans  such as loan 5, 6 and 8 that STF had sight of Mrs R 
bank statements. But as it has explained, at the time it didnt have the ability to store the 
data. We only know it saw the statements because it has been noted on the application 
form. 
But as Mrs R hasnt provided us with the bank statements, and STF hasnt provided us with 
details of what it saw, it is difficult to place any weight on this. But as Ive explained above, 
the loan being pound and pence affordable is only part of the consideration. So, I havent felt 
he need to recreate individual, proportionate affordability checks form loan 6 because I didnt 
consider it necessary to do so. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mrs R, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mrs R. Having looked at the overall pattern of 
STFs lending history with Mrs R, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it 
provided loan 6. I say this because;
By loan 6 it was nearly 12 months into the lending relationship with no breaks 
between loans. And the loans generally overlapped, often with up to two loans 
running at the same time. As loans overlapped, Mrs Rs overall indebtedness 
generally increased. In my view, Mrs Rs loan history up until this point was a clear 
indication that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving; 
By loan 6 and nearly 12 months into the lending relationship, Mrs Rs weekly 
repayments had increased from £20 (at loan 1) to £70. This to suggests, that Mrs Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably, and she was likely needing further 
borrowing to cover ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to cover one-off 
purchases, for example. 
Mrs R took some loans around the same time previous ones were repaid, for 
example, loans 3, 4 and 6. STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Mrs R, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-
term financial need. To me, this is an indication her indebtedness wasnt sustainable;
Mrs R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 25 was 
taken out nearly four years after Mrs Rs loan. And it was for the largest capital 
amount she borrowed - £900. Mrs R had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to STF over an extended period.I think that Mrs R lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 25 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 25 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs R from loan 6 as Im satisfied it ought to have.  
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs R may have simply left matters there 
and not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, 
she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even 
possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs R in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs R would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Mrs R loans 6 - 25.
If STF has sold the outstanding debts, it should buy these back if it is able to do so and
then take the following steps. If STF is not able to buy the debts back, then it should liaise
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs R towards interest,
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything
it has already refunded.
B) STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs R
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs R originally made the
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mrs R as though they had been
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs R having made
overpayments then STF should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest*calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the
date the complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A and
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus
then the surplus should be paid to Mrs R. However, if there is still an outstanding balance
then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs R. STF shouldnt
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Mrs Rs borrowing about loan 6 - 25 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Rs credit 
file. STF does not have to remove loans from Mrs Rs credit file until they have been repaid, 
but STF should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. STF should
give Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax STF has deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Rs complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2021.
