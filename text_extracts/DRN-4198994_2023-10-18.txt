The complaint
Mr Js complaint is that Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
MoneyBoat lent Mr J one short term instalment loan in July 2018. The loan was for £500 with 
six monthly repayments (5 x £159.33 and 1 x 159.25).
Our adjudicator didnt think MoneyBoat was wrong to lend to Mr J and so she didnt 
recommend that this complaint should be upheld. Mr J disagreed, he said MoneyBoat should 
have carried out thorough checks before lending and had it done so it would have seen he 
had a gambling problem. Mr J says his credit file showed he was borrowing regularly and 
reliant on credit. Mr J also says the fact MoneyBoat adjusted his declared expenses to 
reflect a higher amount suggests it should have taken its checks further.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MoneyBoat is aware of its obligation when lending as set out in the regulators handbook as 
it has referred to it in its final response to Mr J. Weve also set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. So, I wont repeat them here.
MoneyBoat asked Mr J about his monthly income and living costs. It also searched his credit 
file before agreeing to lend. Mr J requested £1,500 but MoneyBoat only lent £500, the 
purpose of the loan was stated as credit repair. 
Mr J declared his monthly income as £3,000 and his monthly living costs including credit 
commitments as £1,630, MoneyBoat increased Mr Js expensed by £303 and so lent on the 
basis that Mr Js monthly expenses including credit commitment was £1,933. This would 
have left Mr J sufficient disposable income to afford the loan repayments over the term.
Mr Js credit file showed he had a number of active unsecured loans, the payday loans on 
his credit file were showing as settled and so from what I can see, Mr J wasnt repaying any 
payday loans at the time MoneyBoat lent to him although he had used payday loans in the 
past. Mr J also had a number of credit card accounts, the total outstanding balance on all his 
credit card accounts was £15,701. Mr J was utilising around 80% of his available revolving 
credit limit. The credit file showed Mr J was up to date on all his active accounts and had 
only opened 2 credit accounts in the last six months. Mr J had also recently repaid a credit 
card with a balance of over £,2500.
There was nothing obvious from Mr Js credit file that suggests he was in financial 
difficulties. MoenyBoat reacted to the information it saw on Mr Js credit file by increasing his 
expenses to reflect the credit payments. Im also mindful that the loan repayment was a 
small portion of Mr Js declared income (MoneyBoat says it verified his income through 
credit reference agencies). The checks MoneyBoat carried out show Mr J was left with 
sufficient disposable income to repay the loan over the six-month term.
Given the overall circumstances of this lending and what MoneyBoat found from its checks, 
I think it did enough before lending. It reacted to the information on Mr Js credit file by 
increasing his monthly expenses, that was reasonable in the circumstances of this case. 
I appreciate Mr J says a deeper look into his financial circumstances was necessary and that 
looking at his bank statements would have shown he had a gambling problem.
While theres a requirement for MoneyBoat to carry out reasonable and proportionate 
checks, it isnt automatically required to check bank statements when lending. I havent seen 
anything that should have triggered it to request bank statements from Mr J before agreeing 
this loan. There was also nothing it saw that made it aware Mr J had problems with 
gambling.
The purpose of the loan wasnt unreasonable, it borrowed Mr J less than he requested 
based on its checks. Those checks also showed Mr Js expenses were more than he 
declared, something MoneyBoat reacted to, and Mr J was still able to meet the loan 
repayments and have disposable income left.
I dont think MoneyBoat was wrong to lend in the circumstances. I appreciate Mr J will be 
disappointed with my findings as he clearly feels strongly about his complaint but based on 
reasonable and proportionate checks, MoneyBoat wasnt wrong to lend. 
My final decision
For the reasons stated above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
