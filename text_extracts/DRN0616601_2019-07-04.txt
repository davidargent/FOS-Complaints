Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (CashEuroNet trading as Pounds  2 Pocket 
and Quick Quid) irresponsibly lent to him. He wants a refund of the interest he paid and 
references removed  from his credit file.
background
This complaint is about 6 instalment loans and 5 short term loans provided to Mr M between 
September 2012 and March 2015. Mr M borrowed continuously  from CashEuroNet and 
there were no significant gaps in his borrowing.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought loan 6 and from that point 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
CashEuronet disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
Ref: DRN06166012But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr M could sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the regulations defines  sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
The first five loans I am considering here had repayments that were relatively affordable 
compared to information that Mr M declared  to CashEuroNet. So given what Mr M needed to 
repay on these loans, I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for CashEuroNet  to ask 
him for the amount of information that would be needed to show  the lending  was 
unsustainable at this point.
 
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr M provided or the information  CashEuroNet 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying. So I dont  think  CashEuroNet was wrong to give these first five loans to      
Mr M.
But by the time Mr M had applied for loan 6, I think CashEuroNet should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
I say this because:
Ref: DRN06166013By loan 6 Mr M had been borrowing continuously and with regularity from 
CashEuroNet. Mr M had requested 5 short term loans and 1 instalment loan within a 
7 month  period.
When Mr M asked  for loan 6, CashEuroNet  ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr M had to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous  loan was 
leaving in his finances.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CashEuroNet and the 
amounts he tended  to borrow didnt decrease at all. Mr M had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to CashEuroNet over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time. 
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint regarding Loans  6 to 11 and CashEuroNet  should put 
things right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 11 should be removed from   
Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr M a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
It appears Mr M still owes CashEuroNet  some of the principal balance he borrowed on his 
final loan. CashEuroNet  may deduct  this from the compensation  that is due to him. But, to be 
clear, that outstanding  balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, 
but taking account of any repayments Mr M has made on that loan as though they were 
applied against  the principal sum borrowed.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ms 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr M compensation as set out above.
Ref: DRN06166014Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 August 2019.
