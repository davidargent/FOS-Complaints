K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that Marks & Spencer  Financial Services Plc made mistakes on a balance  
transfer and his outstanding balance should be lower than it is.
background
Mr H made  a successful branch application  for a M&S credit  card.  Some weeks  later he 
applied again,  and M&S mistakenly opened  him a second account. Mr H says he didnt 
realise that he had opened two credit card accounts. He made four balance transfers from 
two Bank  of Scotland (BoS) accounts  over a period  of a few weeks,  which  M&S  credited 
between his two M&S  accounts. Mr H says he then only made repayments to one of his 
M&S accounts because  he was unaware that he had a second  one. He therefore incurred 
charges on the second account and M&S  sent him arrears letters. Mr H then complained to 
M&S about what had happened.
M&S investigated and apologised for the mistakes it had made including  allowing Mr H to 
open two cards when  its rules permit only one, and not querying a repeat balance  transfer  
he made in branch. It closed one of his accounts  and merged the balance with the amount  
outstanding on the other  account.  It refunded all charges and corrected Mr Hs credit file. It 
also paid him £250  compensation.
Mr H was unhappy with this mainly because he believed that in merging his two accounts 
M&S had incorrectly calculated the amount  he now owed. And so he brought  his complaint 
to us.
In summary,  our adjudicator found  that whilst M&S  had made  a number of mistakes, it had 
now corrected these  and he considered  its actions  and the £250 compensatory payment  to 
be sufficient in the circumstances. He therefore concluded that he wouldnt be asking M&S 
to do any more.
Mr H remained  dissatisfied with this outcome.  In particular, and having looked at our 
adjudicators calculation of his current balance,  Mr H continued to believe  that it was too 
high. He therefore asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
M&S should have  allowed only one of Mr Hs credit  card applications, but it mistakenly 
approved both. It has apologised for this even though Mr H provided some different 
information on his second application. 
M&S was right to apologise because notwithstanding this different information, in my opinion 
there was sufficient commonality between the applications for M&S to have  identified  that it 
had received a duplicate  application. However  I would also have expected  that at some  point 
Mr H would have realised  that he had opened two accounts as he received two different 
cards and M&S sent monthly statements for each account.
But having  opened the accounts Mr H made  four balance transfers from two BoS accounts, 
which M&S allocated  across his two new accounts. Two of the transfers were for identical  
amounts, albeit from different BoS accounts, and M&S has apologised for not realising this 
at the time and querying it with Mr H. 
Ref: DRN34878712However, the transfers were displayed on Mr Hs relevant M&S statements, and also on 
those he received from BoS for the two accounts from which  the funds had originated.  
But believing he had opened only one M&S  account Mr H made  repayments  towards  only 
one. The result was that he incurred late fees and charges on the other  account  ultimately  
resulting in correspondence from M&S about his missed payments. It was this that alerted  
him to the fact that all wasnt well and he complained to M&S.
It took M&S  some time to unravel what had happened  and to identify the mistakes  it had 
made in its dealings with Mr H. As the banks rules  permit customers  to have only one 
account M&S removed  the charges Mr H had incurred  on the account he hadnt been 
repaying and closed it. It merged the outstanding  balance with that on Mr Hs remaining 
account. It also amended  Mr Hs credit reference  file to remove  all adverse information 
related to the account mix up, and paid Mr H £250  compensation  (£75 by cheque and £175 
credit to card ending 2645).
Whilst it is regrettable that M&S  made the early errors it did in mistakenly opening two 
accounts for Mr H, I am satisfied that the actions it has now taken, alongside the £250 
compensation it has paid to him, is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
But Mr H remains  unhappy about  the merged balance believing it to be too high. I have 
looked at the various transactions that have  resulted in the balance  Mr H is querying  and 
believe these to be correct. In an attempt to clarify the position  for Mr H I have set out below 
the various transactions on his two accounts  and hope this will be helpful  to him.
