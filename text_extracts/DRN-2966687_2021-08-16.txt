The complaint
Mr C complains that, despite settling his PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) credit
account with an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA), his general PayPal services account
is still open. That  PayPal is pursuing him for the outstanding amount and defaults are on his
credit file.
He would like his balance to show as zero, his account to show as settled from when he
completed the IVA (October 2019) and his PayPal services account to be closed.
What happened
Mr C says when he experienced financial difficulties, he came to an IVA agreement with his
debtors with the help of a debt management agency (DMA) He says through the DMA he
made full and final settlements to all his creditors including PayPal. His other creditors
closed his accounts except PayPal.
PayPal said the credit account had been closed with the account noted as partially settled
from October 2019, the date the IVA was completed. But it said the regular account
remained open but restricted due as the account having breached restricted activities.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision in which I found :-
PayPal closed Mr Cs credit account and updated his credit file to show the account 
as partially settled. I agreed with our investigators view that it was not unreasonable 
for PayPal to record the account as partially settled rather than with a zero balance. It 
was important that credit files accurately reflect account history and, although Mr C 
entered an IVA settling some of the balance, this didnt cover the full amount.
 PayPal has confirmed that it is not pursuing Mr C for the outstanding balance on his 
account.
I also agreed with our investigator that although there was a delay on PayPals part in 
updating Mr Cs credit file (due to human error) I didnt think any compensation for 
that was appropriate. PayPals actions didnt impact on the date of the IVA - that 
would always have remained on Mr Cs credit file for six years. Also, Mr C hadnt, as 
far as I was aware, evidenced any negative impact on him from PayPals delay in 
updating his credit file.
The outstanding issue was the closure of Mr C regular PayPal account. I could 
understand Mr C wanting to close this and end his relationship with PayPal. And I 
could also understand his frustration at not being able to do so. The account terms 
and conditions state accounts can be closed at any time so I didnt think it was 
unreasonable for Mr C to have assumed he could just close his account.
We went back to PayPal to seek clarification on why it wouldnt close Mr Cs account. 
It explained that  in line with its online user agreement it limits account to manage risk 
and to protect buyers and sellers when it notices restricted activities, an increased 
financial risk, or other activities that appear as unusual or suspicious. By limiting the 
account neither Mr C nor any other users could  take any actions on the account. 
Specific reasons as to why accounts might be limited are listed in the terms Mr C 
agreed to.
PayPal provided information, in confidence to us , as to why it limited Mr Cs account. 
It wasnt right for me to disclose that information to Mr C  as PayPal has asked this 
service not to do so. But having seen this information  I was satisfied that PayPal 
acted fairly in continuing to limit Mr Cs account here. 
PayPals actions meant Mr Cs account cant be closed in the way he would like. But 
in the individual circumstances here  I was satisfied this was fair. This wasnt  
having an impact beyond Mr Cs individual dealings with PayPal itself. Its not being 
reported on Mr Cs  credit file in a way that means that itd have wider implications for 
him. Mr Cs credit file reflects that the account has been settled  which is accurate 
and thats what other creditors would see.
It was fair for PayPal not to close Mr Cs account
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal accepted my provisional decision in full and made no comments for me to respond 
to.
As Mr C didnt make any comments in response to my provisional decision, we contacted 
him to make sure there was nothing he wanted me to consider. He told us he felt in my 
provisional decision I had agreed with him, so was surprised  I hadnt asked PayPal to close 
his account. And that he doesnt know why PayPal is entitled to keep his details.
I can understand Mr Cs frustrations. Although I acknowledged in my provisional decision 
that PayPals terms and conditions may well have led Mr C to believe he could just close his 
account I didnt agree with him that the account should be closed. Further information from 
PayPal persuaded me it had good reasons for not closing Mr Cs account.
I also understand Mr Cs frustration that he doesnt know why PayPal wont just close his 
account and so have kept his details. But that information was given to us in confidence and 
only on the condition we didnt share it .Mr C could ask PayPal direct if it would explain to 
him its actions 
I have reviewed my provisional decision and, in particular,  the reasons PayPal gave us as to 
why it wont close Mr Cs account. I still believe its reasons are valid. And with no new 
information from Mr  C to consider I see no reason to change my provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2021.
