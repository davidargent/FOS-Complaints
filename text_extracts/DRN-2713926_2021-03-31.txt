The complaint
Mr Y complains about incorrect information reported on his credit file by TransUnion 
International UK Limited (TransUnion).  
  
What happened
In March 2020 Mr Y applied for a mortgage with a family member and paid £300 for a 
valuation. The application was later rejected when the lender found adverse information 
recorded on Mr Ys credit file. 
Mr Y complained that TransUnion had reported someone elses adverse information on his 
credit file. TransUnion agree it had incorrectly matched someone elses details to Mr Ys 
credit file and took steps to remove it. TransUnion upheld Mr Ys complaint and apologise. 
Mr Ys representative has explained TransUnion didnt initially remove all the linked 
information and had to be contacted again to resolve the matter. 
Mr Ys case was referred to this service and passed to an investigator. Mr Ys application 
was successfully appealed and he was able to use the valuation he had paid for. The 
investigator upheld Mr Ys complaint and asked TransUnion to pay him £200 for the trouble 
and upset caused. Mr Ys representative didnt accept and said they thought TransUnion 
should also pay the £300 Mr Y had incurred for the valuation. Our investigator didnt agree 
so Mr Ys case has been referred to me to make a decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties agree that TransUnion made a mistake when it reported someone elses 
information on Mr Ys credit file. After a complaint was raised, TransUnion took steps to 
correct the error. I can see TransUnion had to relook at the situation when some links 
remained on Mr Ys credit file but I understand the error has now been resolved.
Mr Ys representative has said TransUnion should pay for the £300 valuation but I dont 
agree thats fair. Our approach to complaints is to put the consumer back into the position 
they wouldve been in had no error been made. In this case, Mr Ys representative has 
confirmed he was able to use the valuation he paid for. Given Mr Y would always have 
needed to pay a fee and was able use the valuation he paid for it wouldnt be fair to tell 
TransUnion to cover that cost. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint and asked TransUnion to pay Mr Y £200 to reflect the 
trouble and upset caused by its error. Our awards seek to reflect the impact of an error on a 
consumer, we cant fine or punish a business. I understand Mr Ys representative has told us 
he had to undertake additional work to get the mortgage approved following an appeal, but I 
think its reasonable to note he appears to have been acting in his role as financial advisor. 
Ive reviewed the available information and carefully considered how the issues raised have 
impacted Mr Y. In my view, £200 is a fair settlement and does reflect the impact of the 
incorrect information reported on Mr Ys credit file. I can see that the issue did cause 
problems with Mr Ys mortgage application, but it was ultimately successful and the incorrect 
information has been amended. As I agree with the investigator that £200 is fair in all the 
circumstances, Im not telling TransUnion to increase the award or take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited to 
pay Mr Y £200. 
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2021.
