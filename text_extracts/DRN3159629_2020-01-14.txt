MYJAR upheld Mr As complaint about loan 2. It offered to refund the interest Mr A paid on 
this loan and added  on interest as it was required to do. It also said it would remove  any 
negative credit information that may be recorded  in relation to this loan. So, to be clear,  in 
my decision,  I will not be further considering Mr As complaint  about  loan 2.
Looking at the other loans, our adjudicator said that she didnt have enough  to think MYJAR 
had done anything wrong in relation to loan 1 and loan 3. But she concluded  that Mr A had 
become persistently reliant on short term loans from loan 4 onwards. She partially upheld 
Mr As complaint.
MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicators view. It said that her response  lacked explanation 
and failed to mention the business file provided in relation to Mr As borrowing  history.  It also 
said there was a considerable gap of 108 days between loans 5 and 6 and the amounts 
borrowed for loans  6 and 7 considerably  decreased. It said by this time Mr A was utilising  
less than 3% of his available credit  limit ratio. As MYJAR disagrees with the adjudicators 
view, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN31596292But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
MYJAR told us that, when  the loans were  taken, it asked Mr A for details of his income and 
expenditure costs.  It also says it carried out credit checks. Ive seen a summary of those 
checks. Mr A was in the early stages  of his relationship with MYJAR when he took out loan 1 
and loan 3 and I dont think its likely the amounts Mr A needed to repay showed anything  
that might  have caused concern to MYJAR at this stage taking into account that the sums 
were relatively modest compared to his declared income. Taking  everything  into account, I 
think the checks MYJAR did for loans 1 and 3 were likely enough  and I cant  safely  say 
MYJAR did anything wrong to lend Mr A loans 1 and 3.
But by the time Mr A asked for loan 4, I have decided to uphold Mr As complaint. I will 
explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr A, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  MYJAR  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR  should  have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Ref: DRN31596293Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
4. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr A was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. By the time Mr A had taken out his fourth loan he had been 
indebted to MYJAR for just over seven months. So MYJAR ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr A was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr As indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr As first loan was for £300  and loan 4 was for £400. Mr A had also borrowed  
larger amounts when he took out loans 2 and 3. So, it doesnt seem likely that Mr As 
need for cash was reducing which also points to him having a longer term need for 
funds. So, at this point MYJAR ought  to have  known that Mr A was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
There was very little gap between the time he paid off the previous loan and the time 
he took out his fourth and fifth loan.  Mr A took out his fourth loan just 16 days after 
repaying loan 3 and there was only five days between borrowing again  when  Mr A 
took out loan 5.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 8 was 
taken out around a year and half after Mr As first. And it was for a larger  amount. 
Mr A had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr A lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr A borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr As ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
MYJAR responded  to our adjudicators view. It said there was a considerable gap of 108 
days between providing Mr A with loans  5 and 6. It also told us the amounts borrowed for 
loans 6 and 7 considerably decreased and Mr A was utilising less than 3% of his credit limit 
ratio at this time.
I do not agree with MYJAR. Mr A had a lending relationship with MYJAR  for around a year 
by the end of loan 5, So I dont think this break was enough for MYJAR to say that Mr As 
situation was likely  to have improved over the time he didnt borrow before loan 6.  
And although the amounts Mr A wanted  to borrow for loans 6 and 7 reduced these were 
taken within  12 days of each other.  So, on MYJARs  own information and the quick  
succession Mr A was taking them out, I dont think it was reasonable for it to conclude that 
Mr A was going to be able to manage to repay  his loans sustainably.  I also note by the time 
Mr A had taken loan 8, I can see he fell into arrears and was late making his repayments.  
His information would have shown he had other short-term lending  commitments which 
MYJAR should have  taken into account.  
Ref: DRN31596294In these circumstances I'm not persuaded that MYJAR acted responsibly when it provided 
Mr A with loan 4 onwards to loan 8.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  4, 5 6, 7 and 8 and MYJAR should put things right.
And MYJAR  should  also pay the offer it made about  loan 2 if Mr A accepts my decision. 
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loan 2 and loans 4-8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 2 from Mr As credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 4 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  4, 5, 6,7 and 8 should be removed from 
Mr As credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr As complaint. MYJAR  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2020.
