The complaint
Miss S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA hasnt refunded her for an item she 
returned to a seller, after she raised a clam under its Buyer Protection scheme.
What happened
Miss S bought an item of clothing from a company using a PayPal account. The item was 
too small, but the seller refused to exchange it. So, Miss S raised a claim under PayPals 
Buyer Protection scheme. PayPal agreed to refund Miss S if she sent the item back and 
provided it with tracking details. Miss S says she did this within the timescale PayPal had 
specified.
Miss S says the seller confirmed they had received the item and agreed to replace it. They 
later said that they wouldnt send the replacement unless Miss S paid £85. Miss S got back 
in touch with PayPal who told her that it didnt have the tracking information. Miss S says 
that after searching for the tracking information she found that the PayPal adviser had 
entered the characters incorrectly. She says she spent a lot of time trying to resolve the 
matter over the phone. 
PayPal then said it wasnt able to decide the Buyer Protection claim in her favour because 
she didnt provide the return tracking information to it within the requested timeframe. It said 
it had sent the seller an email asking them to fully refund her because the tracking 
information showed Miss S had returned the item in the requested timeframe. 
Miss S raised a complaint with PayPal. She said she did provide the tracking information in 
time, but the PayPal adviser had taken down some of the characters incorrectly. The seller 
had confirmed receipt of the returned item but was now rejecting all forms of communication 
and would not give her a refund. 
PayPals response to Miss Ss complaint didnt address her concerns. Miss S says she 
called PayPal many more times since and had to give each person an extensive and 
detailed account of the situation, but she still hadnt received the refund. She asked our 
service to consider her complaint.
PayPal told us that it hadnt issued the refund because the tracking information didnt show 
confirmed delivery to the sellers address. It said that as Miss S had paid for the item as a 
guest user, it didnt have any contact notes or call recordings available. 
Our investigator looked into Miss Ss concerns and thought her complaint should be upheld. 
He acknowledged that the tracking information was confusing and suggested the item hadnt 
been delivered. But he felt there was overwhelming evidence showing the item was 
delivered to the seller. He didnt think it was fair or reasonable for PayPal to have ignored 
this. He recommended PayPal refund Miss S the cost of the item (£249.99) and pay her an 
additional £100 for trouble and upset.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view, but later made an offer to pay Miss S £250. 
Miss S said she was glad PayPal had finally agreed to pay the refund. But she didnt think 
that was enough to put things right for her, given the distress and inconvenience shed 
experienced. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached broadly the same conclusions as our investigator. Ill explain 
why.
PayPals user agreement says that, in certain circumstances, a buyer who pays using a 
PayPal account may be entitled to reimbursement of the full purchase price of the item plus 
the original shipping costs (they) paid if any.
From what I can see, PayPal agreed to refund the amount Miss S had paid for the item if she 
returned it to the seller within a specified timeframe. It said she needed to initiate the return 
shipment and upload the tracking information to the Resolution Centre before 18 July 2021.
Miss S has sent us a copy of an email PayPal sent to her on 23 August 2021 which says: 
We were unable to decide this claim in your favour because you didnt provide the return 
tracking information to us within the requested timeframe.
But PayPal has since told our service that this wasnt the reason Miss Ss Buyer Protection 
claim was declined. It says it had the correct tracking number from Miss S, but the claim was 
declined because she was unable to provide proof of return delivery to the sellers address. 
PayPal has provided a screenshot of information relating to the tracking number Miss S 
provided. This is showing as despatched and says: we have your parcel and it is on its 
way. But beneath that its showing as delivered on 15 July 2021 and collected on 19 July 
2021. The location it was collected from is close to where Miss S lives. The delivered 
location is closer to sellers place of business. 
I can see why the tracking information on the couriers website might have given PayPal the 
impression that the item hadnt been delivered to the seller. But Miss S has shown us that 
she passed on a message from the courier to PayPal which explain why the collected date 
was after the delivered date on the tracking information. The courier said that this was due 
to a late scan. The message also confirmed that the item had been recorded as delivered to 
the sellers address on 15 July 2021. 
Miss S has also provided us with a copy of an email she sent to PayPal on 27 August 2021 
with supporting evidence to show that the item was successfully returned to the seller. This 
includes a proof of delivery notification from the courier showing that the item was delivered 
on 15 July 2021. The delivery address is the sellers address and name of receiver is one 
of the companys directors. 
Another email Miss S sent to PayPal includes screenshots of messages between her and 
the seller on 17 July 2021, where the seller confirms theyd received the item of clothing. 
I dont think PayPal gave proper consideration to the evidence Miss S had provided to show 
that the item had been successfully delivered to the seller. So, I think it would be fair for 
PayPal to reimburse her for the £249.99 she paid for it.
PayPal says it isnt able to provide us with any contact notes or call recordings. But Im 
persuaded by what Miss S has told us about the difficulties she had trying to get PayPal to 
agree to the refund. Miss S says shed had more than 40 phone conversations with PayPal which lasted over 25 minutes and had resulted in stress, tears and anxiety. Shed been told 
completely different things every time and had sent numerous emails with no response. She 
says the item was a birthday present for her young son, and she wasnt able to get him 
another one without the refund. This was no doubt very upsetting for her. So, I think it would 
be fair for PayPal to pay Miss S an additional £100 for trouble and upset she experienced.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Miss S a total of £349.99 (£249.99 for the cost of the item plus £100 for 
trouble and upset.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Ss complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
