The complaint
Mr E complains that U K Insurance Limited over-charged him for his motor insurance policy.
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with an individual consumers complaint against an
insurance company or other regulated financial firm. We are bound by the Financial Conduct
Authoritys dispute resolution rules (DISP).
One of those rules is that we cant investigate complaints about events more than six years
after they happened or (if later) three years after the consumer ought reasonably to have
known he had cause to complain. There are exceptions where the firm consents to us
investigating or where exceptional circumstances prevented the consumer from complaining
within those time limits.
Mr E took out a UKI car insurance policy in 1986 and it has renewed automatically on about
29 June each year since then.
In 2019, he received a renewal letter and contacted UKI. It reduced the proposed premium
by 20%. In 2020, he had a similar experience.
In about mid-June 2020, he complained to UKI that it had been charging him too much in
previous years. By a short form of final response dated 18 June 2020, UKI told Mr E of his
right to bring his complaint to us. Mr E did that later in June 2020.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that
UKI had treated Mr E unfairly or that it caused him a financial loss.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr E 
and to UKI on 18 March 2021. I summarise my findings:
I didnt think that UKI only increased the price because Mr E was likely to renew the 
policy without question  and there was no apparent change in the risk insured. 
From the confidential pricing information it had sent us, I was satisfied that UKI 
wouldve priced the renewal in the same way for any policyholder in the same 
situation as Mr E. 
And the fact that he got discounts in 2019 and 2020 didnt persuade me that UKI 
treated Mr E unfairly in 2016, 2017 or 2018.
Subject to any further information from Mr E or from UKI, my provisional decision was that I 
didnt uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct U K Insurance Limited to do any more in 
response to this complaint.
Mr E disagrees with the provisional decision. He says, in summary, that:
In 2019, UKI quoted £641.00, and he was happy to finish up with a seemingly good 
discount of 20%.
In 2020 he easily attained another large reduction. 
The size of the reductions reflected the high base level hed been on for such a long 
time.
For a five year old car valued at £11,300.00, UKI has recently quoted him  as a new 
policyholder - £403.00 without any no claims allowance.
This is significantly below what he has been paying for older and less valuable cars.
He would like us to reconsider his application for being misled, as to " best deals and 
best offers available - check the small print before you move" advice hes had by 
aggressive sales people.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I find it likely that Mr E received renewal letters each year. So he ought reasonably to have
known at the time of each price increase. Whilst he has said he was busy working, I dont
find any exceptional circumstances preventing him from complaining before June 2020. So I
dont consider that I have the legal power to investigate renewals more than six years before
Mr E complained in June 2020.
Its not for me to say whats a fair price for insurance. Different insurers will price risk
differently. So the fact that lower prices are available doesnt show that higher prices are
wrong or unfair.
However, UKI had to treat Mr E fairly when setting a renewal premium. It wouldnt be fair If
UKI only increased the price because Mr E was likely to renew the policy without question 
and there was no apparent change in the risk insured.
The more recent renewal premiums were as follows:
2013 £339.20
2014 £390.08
2015 £438.84
2016 £538.74
2017 £575.68
2018 £573.44
2019 £482.72
2020 £405.44Throughout that time, the policy excess was £300.00, and Mr E has paid for a protected no 
claims discount. Since 2014, the policy only covered one driver - Mr E. Whist he may feel
that his risk profile hasnt changed, his premiums are affected by external factors such as,
for example, the typical costs of third party claims for repairs and personal injury claims.
UKIs records of the renewal in 2014 say that Mr E got in contact to discuss the renewal
premium. In September 2015, Mr E changed his vehicle. This led to an increase in premium
of £74.20. but UKIs file says that was after it applied a loyalty discount. So Mr E had
engaged with UKI about pricing in 2014 and 2015.
From 2016, Mr E paid an instalment charge for paying the yearly premium by instalments.
From what Ive seen, Mr E didnt engage with UKI about renewal prices in 2016, 2017 or
2018. But I note that in 2018 the price came down slightly in any event.
UKI quoted higher prices in 2019 and 2020 before Mr E negotiated the discounted figures 
Ive set out above. But that doesnt persuade me that UKI treated Mr E unfairly in 2016, 2017 
or 2018.
Mr E hasnt provided a copy of the recent quote or the information on which it was based. So 
he hasnt shown that the figure of £403.00 was for a new policyholder or excluded no claims 
discount.
Mr E has fallen short of showing that UKI gave him misleading information about its pricing. 
Im satisfied that its renewal letters were clear enough.
I dont think that UKI only increased the price because Mr E was likely to renew the policy
without question  and there was no apparent change in the risk insured. From the
confidential pricing information it has sent us, Im satisfied that UKI wouldve priced the
renewal in the same way for any policyholder in the same situation as Mr E.
Overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI to make any refund to Mr E or to do 
anything further in response to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct U K Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2021.
