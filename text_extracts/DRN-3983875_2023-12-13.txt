The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, 
wont refund to them the money that they paid for some holiday club membership credits. 
Theyre being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs P bought a holiday product from a holiday company in December 2017. Mr and 
Mrs Ps representative says that the purchase price was £24,667 and that they used a loan 
from Vacation Finance to pay £17,267 of that amount. Vacation Finance says that the loan 
was repaid in June 2018.
Mr and Mrs P then entered into a membership application agreement in November 2018 to 
buy 4,000 level two holiday club membership credits from the holiday company. The 
membership price was £10,000, they paid a deposit of £3,000 and they entered into a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of £7,000. They agreed to make 120 
monthly payments of £90.96 to Vacation Finance.
Mr and Mrs Ps representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs P, made claims under sections 75 
and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to Vacation Finance about the November 2018 
purchase in May 2021. It said, in summary and amongst other things, that: the membership 
credits were mis-sold to Mr and Mrs P and, but for the misrepresentations made to them, 
they wouldnt have purchased them nor entered into the loan agreement; the holiday 
company is in liquidation and cant provide the service sold so is in breach of contract; the 
terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be unfair; the payment of commission was 
hidden from view; the membership credits were marketed as an investment in contravention 
of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and 
were sold to Mr and Mrs P under extreme sales pressure; no affordability checks were 
carried out on Mr and Mrs Ps ability to afford the loan; and their relationship with Vacation 
Finance is unfair.
Vacation Finance provided a response to Mr and Mrs Ps claims but the response related to 
the December 2017 purchase and loan. Mr and Mrs P werent satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service. Their complaint form says: Vacation Finance paid a commission 
to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; the holiday company unduly 
pressured them into entering into the membership application agreement and the loan 
agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; the membership 
credits were misrepresented to them; the holiday company marketed and sold the credits as 
an investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations; the holiday company is in liquidation 
so is in breach of contract; and they werent provided with key information necessary for 
them to be able to make an informed decision regarding their purchase; all rendering the 
loan agreement unfair under section 140A; and it says that their complaint should also be 
considered under section 75.
Our investigator wrote to Vacation Finance and said that its final response addresses its 
stance on the finance provided for Mr and Mrs P's purchase in December 2017 but, from the 
claim letter sent, Mr and Mrs P seem to be making their claims about their November 2018 
purchase. She asked it to provide its response to the claims made. No further response was 
received from Vacation Finance so our investigator assessed the complaint on the 
information that she had received. 
She didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ps complaint should be upheld as she didnt think 
that it would be unfair or unreasonable for Vacation Finance to turn down their claims. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think 
that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough 
to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs P and Vacation Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending 
was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs P.
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that Mr and Mrs P dont agree with the investigation in 
relation to their 2018 purchase and have asked for their complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman. It has provided an addendum containing submissions on behalf of Mr and 
Mrs P which says, in summary and amongst other things, that: the product was sold to Mr 
and Mrs P as an investment; the holiday company represented to them that the monies they 
would receive from selling the holiday product that theyd bought in December 2017 would 
effectively cover the whole purchase price of the membership credits in 2018; they 
understood that the resale scheme would be open for members five years following the start 
of their membership but existing members who exchanged for membership credits could 
access the scheme within one year of their first year of occupancy but the resale programme 
opened in 2015 and is now discontinued; the holiday company appears to have gone into 
administration; the holiday company breached the Timeshare Regulations and 
misrepresented the membership credits as something that could be re-sold easily in the 
future; and, were it not for the representations, Mr and Mrs P wouldnt have purchased the 
membership credits and traded-in their existing product.
Similar claims were also made to Vacation Finance about their December 2017 purchase 
and a complaint was then made to this service. That complaint has been dealt with 
separately. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ps complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs P used a loan from Vacation Finance to pay for part of the purchase 
price of a holiday product that they bought from the holiday company in December 
2017 and Vacation Finance says that the loan was repaid in June 2018  Mr and Mrs 
P have made a complaint to this service about Vacation Finances response to 
claims that they made to it under sections 75 and 140A about that purchase and that 
complaint has been dealt with separately so in this decision Im only considering their 
complaint about Vacation Finances response to the claims that theyve made to it 
about their November 2018 purchase;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative has provided a copy of the membership application 
agreement that Mr and Mrs P entered into in November 2018 but Ive not been provided with a copy of the terms and conditions that are referred to in that 
agreement;
Ive also not been provided with a copy any of the other contractual documentation 
that its likely that Mr and Mrs P would have signed with the holiday company at that 
time;
Mr and Mrs P also entered into a loan agreement with Vacation Finance that they 
signed in November 2018 which shows that the cash price was £10,000 and an 
advance payment of £3,000 was made so the loan amount was £7,000;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative made claims to Vacation Finance in May 2021 under 
sections 75 and 140A and a complaint was then made to this service: section 75 
gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or 
the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met); and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ps claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the May 2021 claim letter says that it was represented to Mr and Mrs P by the holiday 
company before their November 2018 purchase that: the membership credits would 
be an excellent investment that could be sold at a profit whenever they wished as 
part of the holiday companys re-sale scheme; they would make a significant profit 
from the sale of the membership credits; and the membership credits were available 
to them at a special price which was only available to them that day;
Mr and Mrs P says that the holiday company told them that it was ending its present 
manner of working and was converting to a points system, they could convert their 
holiday product into membership credits and, at the end of a four year period, they 
could sell their remaining membership credits and the holiday companys 
representative advised that he would guarantee that they could get at least as much 
for them as what they had paid;
the claim letter says that those were false and misleading representations made to 
induce Mr and Mrs P into entering into the membership application agreement and 
Mr and Mrs P say that they soon discovered that several parts of the deal werent 
available to them because of their age and that it was considerably more difficult to 
access than they had been led to believe which left them extremely disappointed;
the claim letter doesnt include a detailed account of the circumstances in which the 
alleged misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to Mr and Mrs P before their November 2018 
purchase;
other than the information described above, none of Mr and Mrs P and their 
representative has provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which it was 
represented to Mr and Mrs P that the membership credits were an investment, the 
conversations that took place, the information that was provided to them before their 
November 2018 purchase or any documentary or other evidence to show that it was 
represented to them that the membership credits were an investment;
I understand that the membership credits can be used for accommodation and 
experiences and Im not persuaded that its likely that the membership credits would properly be considered to be an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr 
and Mrs P as an investment, or that they were marketed or sold to them as an 
investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations;
Mr and Mrs P say that they were told that they could sell their remaining membership 
credits at the end of a four year period  they bought their membership credits in 
November 2018 so, on that basis, the earliest that they would be able to sell them 
was November 2022, about 18 months after their representatives claim letter was 
sent to Vacation Finance, and Ive seen no evidence to show any steps that Mr and 
Mrs P have taken to try to re-sell their membership credits since then;
theres no reference in the membership application agreement that Mr and Mrs Ps 
representative has provided to show that the holiday company had said that a resale 
scheme would be available and Mr and Mrs P havent provided any other evidence to 
support their claim that the holiday companys representative guaranteed that they 
could sell their membership credits for at least as much as they paid for them  and if 
any guarantees had been given to them by the holiday company on which they were 
relying, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for any 
such guarantees to be confirmed in writing;
none of Mr and Mrs P and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the other alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them and which 
caused the membership credits to have been misrepresented to them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the membership credits to Mr and Mrs P, that they were mis-sold to 
them or that they were induced into buying them by any such misrepresentations;
the claim letter and Mr and Mrs Ps complaint form also say that the holiday company 
is in liquidation and cant provide the service sold so is in breach of contract - I 
understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020, but I also 
understand that a new management company has been appointed to provide the 
services in connection with the membership credits and that they are available for Mr 
and Mrs P to use;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract 
for which Vacation Finance might have liability under section 75, but I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any such breach of contract and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ps 
use of their membership credits has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of 
the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract, or any breach of any applicable regulation by the holiday 
company for which Vacation Finance would be liable under section 75 in these 
circumstances;
as well as claiming that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr and 
Mrs P and that theres been a breach of contract, the May 2021 claim letter makes 
other claims, including that: the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the membership credits 
were sold to Mr and Mrs P under extreme sales pressure; no affordability checks 
were carried out on Mr and Mrs Ps ability to afford the loan; and their relationship 
with Vacation Finance is unfair;
Mr and Mrs Ps complaint form says the membership credits were misrepresented to 
them, the holiday company marketed and sold the credits as an investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations, and the holiday company is in liquidation so is in 
breach of contract  but it also says that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to them, the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; the holiday company 
unduly pressured them into entering into the membership application agreement and 
the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; 
and they werent provided with key information necessary for them to be able to 
make an informed decision regarding their purchase;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair  but it hasnt provided the terms and conditions or said which of the 
terms it considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
membership application agreement that Mr and Mrs P entered into in November 
2018 are unfair but I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially 
unfair) term alone is likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an 
unfair relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how 
the term operated in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the 
relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
membership application agreement have been applied or operated unfairly against 
Mr and Mrs P and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these 
circumstances that the terms of the agreement created an unfair relationship 
between Mr and Mrs P and Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that the payment of commission was hidden from 
view and Mr and Mrs Ps complaint form says that Vacation Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs P, but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Vacation Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that Vacation Finance 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances - 
and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Vacation Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and Mrs P risked the 
relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that no affordability checks were carried out on 
Mr and Mrs Ps ability to afford the loan and Mr and Mrs Ps complaint form says that 
the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford 
the loan, but none of Mr and Mrs P and their representative has provided detailed 
information about Mr and Mrs Ps financial situation in November 2018 or other 
evidence to show that they couldnt afford a loan of £7,000 with a monthly repayment 
of £90.96;
Vacation Finance had lent to Mr and Mrs P in December 2017 and it said that theyd 
successfully paid a number of instalments on time then paid the remaining balance in 
June 2018, only six months after the loan was taken out, and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the loan that Vacation Finance made to Mr and 
Mrs P in November 2018 wasnt affordable for them or was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that the membership credits were sold to Mr and 
Mrs P under extreme sales pressure and Mr and Mrs Ps complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure them - but Mr and Mrs P have made similar claims about their 
December 2017 purchase and if theyd been subject to undue pressure and 
aggressive commercial practices by the holiday company in December 2017 that 
werent acceptable to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not 
to have then entered into a membership application agreement to purchase the 
membership credits from the holiday company in October 2018;
Mr and Mrs P had bought a holiday product from the holiday company in December 
2017 so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales tactics that might 
be used by the holiday company before they went into the sales presentation in 
November 2018 and that, if they didnt want to buy the membership credits, they 
would have made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
Mr and Mrs P had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreement 
and the loan agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Vacation 
Finance to withdraw from either of those agreements within the withdrawal periods;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs P were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement or the 
loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive 
commercial practices against them;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative has also referred to breaches by the holiday company 
of the Timeshare Regulations and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading 
Regulations 2008  and the addendum containing submissions on behalf of Mr and 
Mrs P says that the holiday company failed to provide the necessary information 
required by the Timeshare Regulations;
none of Mr and Mrs P and their representative has identified the information that was 
necessary for Mr and Mrs P to make an informed decision regarding the purchase 
but wasnt provided to them by the holiday company and I dont consider that theyve 
provided all of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr and Mrs P at 
the time of the purchase;
Mr and Mrs P had made a purchase from the holiday company in December 2017 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have been aware of the 
information that they needed before they made a decision to buy the membership 
credits in November 2018 so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres been a breach of any of those regulations as alleged;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr and Mrs P and their 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr and Mrs Ps relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs P and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to Mr and Mrs Ps claims about their November 
2018 purchase and hasnt provided any information to this service about their 
complaint so I cant say that its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  
but if it had properly considered their claims I consider that it would have been fair 
and reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs P for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
credits and the financial loss and emotional distress to which theyve referred, but I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid under the loan agreement, to cancel their loan, to pay them any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 January 2024.
