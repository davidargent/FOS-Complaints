The complaint
The estate of Mr K has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund 
transactions made using Mr Ks PayPal account after his death.
Mrs P, Mr Ks wife, represents the estate.
What happened
Mr K died in April 2019 after being ill for a long period. His illness had caused him memory 
loss so hed taken to keeping a note of his passwords and other relevant personal 
information with his phone.
After his death, Mr Ks phone went missing and Mr Ks wife never saw it again. She was able 
to notify Mr Ks banks of his death. On receiving statements she noted a number of PayPal 
transactions which had taken place on 2 and 7 May 2019. Mrs P tried to contact PayPal but 
she didnt have proof of her rights to Mr Ks estate so PayPal wouldnt help her.
Mrs P brought the estates complaint to our service. Because of the impact of the pandemic, 
it took a considerable time for her to get the letters of administration which allowed our 
service to consider the complaint fully. These were obtained in March 2021. We shared a 
copy with PayPal.
Our investigator confirmed to PayPal that there had been no authority for these transactions 
as they took place after Mr Ks death. Nor was there any basis for PayPal to hold Mr K liable 
under their terms and conditions as these lapsed on death.
PayPal didnt agree and asked to refer the estates complaint to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator.
Im aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than our investigator 
did in her view of 13 July 2021. This is because I only need to concentrate on the key issues 
here. 
Im also not planning to repeat all that was said in our investigators view. 
Its worth saying Im surprised PayPal felt it was worthwhile asking an ombudsman to make 
a final decision on this complaint. They are well aware of our approach to the Payment 
Services Regulations 2017 and the impact this would have on this complaint.
Mr K died in April 2019. Ive seen the death certificate which has also been shared with 
PayPal. The four disputed PayPal payments were carried out on 2 and 7 May 2019. I cant 
see theres any room for disagreement that Mr K couldnt have authorised these 
transactions.
PayPal has also raised concerns that Mr K acted in contravention of their terms and 
conditions as he wrote down security details as his memory was failing. Im pretty confident 
that the terms and conditions lapsed on Mr Ks death so I dont believe these apply.  
I have also thought about whether Mr K could have acted in a grossly negligent manner 
under the PSRs. The threshold for gross negligence is a high bar to get over. In normal 
circumstances I may have considered that writing down security details and keeping them by 
your side as meeting that threshold. However, taking into account Mr Ks personal 
circumstances, I think its fair and reasonable to say there was no gross negligence in this 
case.
PayPal has highlighted the time its taken for this complaint to be brought to their attention. 
But I can see Mrs P first raised this with them in May 2019 very shortly after the disputed 
transactions. Mrs P brought the estates complaint to us in June 2019. Our notification to 
PayPal resulted them in issuing a final response in December 2019. So I dont agree that 
PayPal could only investigate what happened after they received a copy of the letters of 
administration in June 2021.
Putting things right
As Im satisfied the disputed transactions werent authorised, PayPal must refund £3,710 to 
the estate.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay £3,710 to the estate of Mr K.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr K 
to accept or reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
