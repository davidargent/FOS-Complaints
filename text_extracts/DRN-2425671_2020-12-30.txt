The complaint
Mr S complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118 118
) registered a default on his credit file when he was unable to make a payment due to 
account access problems.
What happened
Mr S says he opened the credit card account in September 2019 but didnt receive account 
statements and had problems using 118 118s application to log into his account and its 
online banking pages. He says in those circumstances he was unable to make a payment 
but 118 118 added late payment fees and registered a default on his credit file which is 
unfair. Mr S says he didnt receive letters 118 118 says it sent him and is not present in the 
United Kingdom for part of the time. He would like the default removed and says the 
problems were caused by 118 118 and he asked for new passwords to get account access.
118 118 says Mr S didnt make any required payments and says the account statements 
were available to view. It says the first record of telephone contact it has with Mr S was in 
March 2020, but he didnt remain on the call to it and it spoke to him in May 2020. 118 118 
says it sent a number of letters to Mr S including a Notice of Default in April 2020 and has a 
record of Mr S accessing his account via the application in February 2020.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
accepted Mr S may have had problems accessing his account, but he didnt make contact 
with 118 118 until after the default notice and ought to have known a payment was due. The 
investigator also accepted Mr S was not present in the United Kingdom on occasions but 
didnt think that a reason why a payment couldnt have been made or contact made with 118 
118.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and has provided e-mails which he says confirm he tried to get 
access to his account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. 
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I think Mr S would have agreed to 
when the account was opened in 2019. Those terms and conditions make clear that a 
minimum monthly payment is required which will be on the account statement. I appreciate 
that Mr S may have had a problem accessing the account statement, but I think he ought to 
have known he owed 118 118 money and that a monthly payment was required.
I think in those circumstances Mr S ought to have told 118 118 in November 2019 that there 
was a problem accessing the account statements and I dont think 118 118 could reasonably 
have known there may have been a problem. Im satisfied that Mr S would have had contact 
details for 118 118 as they are in the account terms and conditions and available online, and 
ought to have known he had used the credit card in October 2019 and that a payment would 
be due the following month.
I have looked carefully at 118 118s records and the information Mr S has provided us with. I 
have no doubt Mr S tried to change his password to get account access as I have seen the 
e-mails, he has given us. But I think Mr S ought to have considered alternative ways of 
contacting 118 118 and having looked at its records I find the first attempt to call it took place 
in March 2020 and Mr S did not remain on the call. Im satisfied the first contact via 
telephone took place in May 2020 which was some seven months after the payment was 
required and a month after the account defaulted.
Im satisfied 118 118 sent Mr S a number of letters by post including the Notice of Default. 
And I think by that stage 118 118 was reasonably entitled to conclude the relationship 
between it and Mr S had broken down and it was entitled to register the default. I accept 
when Mr S called 118 118 in May 2020 it was initially unable to take a payment from him, but 
Im satisfied at that stage the account had defaulted.
I appreciate that Mr S has provided his travel history and on occasions was not present in 
the United Kingdom. But I dont think that would have prevented him contacting 118 118 
before he did or that he couldnt have contacted it whilst abroad. I also think that even if Mr S 
had problems accessing his account, he could have considered alternative methods of 
paying his credit card bill such as sending 118 118 the money or obtaining its account details 
to make a bank transfer.
Overall, Im satisfied Mr S owed 118 118 money that he didnt pay in line with the credit card 
agreement. I dont find the access problems prevented Mr S making contact with 118 118 to 
obtain alternative ways of paying his debt and am satisfied 118 118 didnt act unfairly or 
make a mistake by registering a default on Mr Ss credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 January 2021.
