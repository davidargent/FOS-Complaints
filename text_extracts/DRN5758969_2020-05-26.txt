K821x#15complaint
Mr S complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr S says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr S took out some 18 instalment loans from Sunny between October 
2018 and April 2019. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ss borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in April 2020 about this case, 
comprehensively setting  out why I was considering  still partially upholding  the complaint 
broadly in the same manner as our adjudicator. But I said I was intending to change  the 
redress section, to incorporate the rapid  and repeated nature of the lending,  which  unfairly 
prolonged the consumers  indebtedness. 
I asked both parties to provide any further submissions or information to me within one 
month. 
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Neither party has added anything new. Theres therefore no reason for me to change  the 
findings I previously  set out. I uphold this complaint in respect of loans 5 - 18, fully in line 
with my provisional decision.
In order to put things  right for Mr S, I think Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 5 -18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ss credit file in relation to loans  5 - 
8 (eight);
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 (nine) onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 9 - 18 should  be 
completely removed from Mr Ss credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr S a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partly uphold this complaint  and I direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr S the above  compensation.
Ref: DRN57589692Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 June  2020.

Ref: DRN57589693summary  provisional  decision
Ive considered the relevant  information about this complaint. Based on what  Ive seen so far Im 
thinking about  still partially upholding the complaint in the same  manner as our adjudicator most  
recently recommended. But Im thinking about changing  the redress section slightly, to incorporate  the 
repeated nature of the lending,  which I think unfairly  prolonged the consumers indebtedness. Ill refer 
to the consumer as Mr S and look at any more comments and evidence about this slight change, 
provided I get a response by 15 May 2020. 
complaint
Mr S complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called Elevate Credit  
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. Mr S says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial  problems.
To keep things simple  Ill refer mainly  to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Mr S took out some 18 instalment loans from Sunny between October 2018 and 
April 2019. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ss borrowing  with Sunny, based on the information it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld from the 
point of loan number 5 onwards. Sunny  made an offer to settle the complaint but this wasnt agreed to 
by Mr S. Ive been  asked  to make an ombudsmans final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry  practice, on our website. Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Mr Ss complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Mr S could  repay  all the 
loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have  taken into account  a range  
of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.  So, Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S 
Ref: DRN57589694could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr S could sustainably 
make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks  before agreeing  to lend to Mr S 
including assessing  his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that at the time all this 
information showed that he would be able to make  the loan repayments he was committing to. Ive 
thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. Ive considered  whether, at some point,  Sunny should  have 
realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans to Mr S. 
Ive taken account  of what Ive said above, about  the length  of the lending relationship,  and applied it 
to the circumstances of loans 1  4 in this case. And like our adjudicator, I dont think  its clear  enough  
that what Sunny would  have would have seen from its checks suggested loans 1  4 were 
unaffordable for Mr S. 
I accept Mr S may have  already been finding managing  money  difficult  at this point. But theres no 
clear record  that the type or depth of credit checks carried out at that time would have exposed these  
issues. So Im afraid I dont  agree that Sunny knew its lending was unsustainable for loans 1 - 4. I 
therefore dont intend to uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 5, the situation  was different and the types of checks 
Sunny ought to have carried out should have been much more comprehensive and searching. Thats 
because by that point hed been borrowing  very rapidly  indeed in my experience, and he was applying  
for loan 5 the day after settling loans 3 and 4. The amount he wanted to borrow  was also steadily 
increasing and loan 5 was the highest in the chain  thus far. But the most  obvious risk was that loan 5 
was his fifth loan in less than 2 weeks; all these things should have easily  alerted Sunny  to something 
not being  right.
Given these obvious factors,  Sunny ought to have carried  out much more  diligent financial checking  
and thought  about the borrowing behaviour Mr S was exhibiting. The loans were  due for repayment 
over instalments but Mr S was taking out loans, incurring  substantial charges and then paying them 
back very quickly. Sunny  had a responsibility to investigate that behaviour and to find out what  was 
making Mr S do this. Our experience of short-term lending tells us that consumers who borrow in this 
way are experiencing wider difficulties in managing money  and are less likely to be able to sustainably  
repay loans  without undue harm. I dont think Sunny ought to have lent him the money for the loan 5 
onwards. I dont think it was responsible to do so.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 9 onwards, there was a clear  pattern of repeated and 
inappropriate lending evident, in my view. Its true that by loan 9 Mr S had only been borrowing  for 
around 8 weeks. But this type of rapid borrowing,  in my view,  shows there  was an obvious 
dependency on high-interest, short-term lending, probably to fund spending that Sunny should have 
been alert to and concerned about. However, theres no evidence Sunny did anything differently.
Mr Ss pattern  continued to exhibit very frequent levels of borrowing and loan 9, for example, was 
granted the day after paying off loans 7 and 8. The borrowing continued  over the Christmas period 
which should have been an additional point  of concern. So Im also upholding Mr Ss complaint in 
respect of loans 9 - 18 because Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr S in an unsustainable manner:
 
Ref: DRN57589695these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use, over an extended time period; and
the length  of time over which Mr S borrowed  was likely to have had negative  implications on 
his ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans.
my provisional  decision
I am intending to partially uphold Mr Ss complaint and direct Elevate Credit  International Limited to 
put things right as set out above. 
Ill look at any more  information about this, provided I get it by 15 May 2020.
