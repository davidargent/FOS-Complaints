Loan 1 was paid off by a loan taken out by Ms M, and loans 2 and 3 were paid off 
respectively by loans 3 and 4. Loan 4 was paid off by a consolidating secured loan. For 
all the loans the information obtained by Everyday Loans was obtained from a home visit, 
in which Ms Ms income and outgoings were discussed. and two months of bank 
statements and payslips were obtained and a credit check carried out.
Ms M says she found herself unable to pay the loans without further borrowing. She 
found herself locked in a debt cycle and fears she will be unable to pay her mortgage 
repayments. She has two children one of whom is disabled.
Our adjudicator said that the information obtained showed a pattern of borrowing over the 
years of substantial sums. Ms M remortgaged her property in 2018 to pay off a number of 
loans and credit liabilities. Our adjudicator further pointed out that Ms Ms credit 
commitments against her income ranged from 38% up to 70% for loan 5. She concluded 
that Everyday Loans shouldnt have lent. She said that Everyday Loans should refund all 
interest and charges applied to the loans.
Everyday Loans disagreed, it said that the credit commitments should not include 
mortgage repayments and for loans 1 to 4 it disagreed that this meant Ms M had too high 
a ratio of credit commitments against income. She had kept to her credit commitments 
and wasnt overusing her overdraft, which she kept well within the limit. It agreed with our 
adjudicators view with regard to Loan 5 although again said that the mortgage payment 
shouldnt be taken into account.
The matter has been passed to me for furtherer consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to consider whether Everyday Loans completed reasonable and proportionate checks 
to satisfy itself that Ms M would be able to repay the loans in a sustainable way and/or 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences. Then taking that into account I have 
to consider whether in the circumstances Everyday Loans made a fair lending decision in 
respect of each loan.
Loan 1
In respect of this loan, Everyday Loans reviewed Ms Ms recent bank statements. The 
affordability assessment calculated that Ms M had credit commitments of 47% of her income 
 a very high figure. If I take out the mortgage payment this still amounts to 35% of her 
income  again a very high figure. Ms M had four credit cards with high balances on them - 
£1,197, £5,406, £740, and £2,099. Everyday Loans assessment allowed only for the 
minimum payment to be made in respect of each a card. And although Everyday Loans has 
pointed out that the overdraft wasnt in constant use, over the three months statements Id 
seen the overdraft figure increased each month. 
The loan appears to have been used to pay off an HP loan for a car, but the balance of it 
wasnt used for paying off loans or credit. And as the nature of Ms Ms job appeared to be 
one where car use was essential, it was likely that she would need HP finance in the future. 
And although she paid off the credit cards with further loans, she still maintained the one 
with the highest balance, and continued to use it. I think in view of her very high credit card 
usage, and the high ratio of credit commitments against her income, she was unlikely to be 
able to sustain the payments. This appears to be borne out by her subsequent borrowing 
and further credit commitments. And although Everyday Loans assessed that she had a 
disposable income of £146 per month left we dont just look at pounds and pence 
affordability. I think its showed Ms M was likely to struggle to repay the loan. I dont think 
Everyday Loans made a fair lending decision. 
Loan 2
Before applying for this loan its clear that Ms M had taken out a large secured loan for 
£42,000 which paid off loan 1. She had paid off some of the credit cards, but she continued 
to maintain the one with a £5,406 balance and hadnt managed to pay any of it off. And 
although the record for this card is marked evidence paid off, it clearly wasnt as it 
appeared on the next two applications. Ms M had also clearly taken out loans since loan 1 
some of which were paid off and are an indication that she was struggling to repay. Taking 
out the mortgage payment her credit commitments were still high  about 30% of her 
income. Her income wasnt very high  about £1,400 - £1,500 a month net. This was 
supplemented by tax credits and a disability living allowance for one of her children, and 
child maintenance. And the lower a persons income is, the more difficult it could be to repay 
the loan.
Everyday Loans notes that the bank statements were for January to March. It doesnt think it 
unreasonable that it takes a majority of people a few months of authorised credit usage to 
factor in the abnormal expenditure from that period. Her credit was still well
managed and paid on time so it does not believe having a good history with lending should 
be reason for further lending not to be granted. Ive noted that her overdraft did increase 
over this period and she only managed to remain in credit from the beginning of March once 
she received the secured loan Ive referred to. I note that up until then and after receiving loan 1 shed been unable to clear her overdraft. And I think she appeared to manage her 
credit by taking out further loans. 
I think that her having taken out loans, and then a loan to repay them, the still high degree of 
credit commitments against income and the inability to repay the overdraft and the credit 
card should have raised concerns for Everyday Loans. I think, having seen the next few 
months of bank statements supplied, starting in August 2016 this bears this out as she 
continued to take out loans to keep up her credit payments. Again I think that Everyday 
Loans should have looked beyond pounds and pence affordability. Even if it calculated that 
she had a disposable income assessed at £397 the bank statements and her borrowing 
history tell a different story. I dont think Everyday Loans made a fair lending decision. 
Loan 3
Just six months after taking out loan 2, Ms M approached Everyday Loans to borrow more 
money. In that time she had taken out a further high interest loan of £13,900, a fixed term 
loan of £3,500 and a further loan. She still had the credit card she had been supposed to pay 
off with loan 2, with an increased balance of £5,919. Shed started using the store credit card 
again which she had paid off after loan 1, with a balance of £490, and a further credit card 
with a balance that had increased from £395 to £1100 over the same six month period. 
On 20 October some three weeks before this loan was taken out Ms M had taken out a 
further loan of £12,000. Everyday Loans only obtained statements up until mid-September, 
and this loan didnt appear on its credit audit record. Her credit commitments against her 
income were now 37% (again excluding her mortgage) despite having previously taken the 
secured loan to pay off those commitments. I think that was high.  If I add the repayment for 
the loan taken out just before loan 3, it brings this up to 47% with a negative disposable 
income.
I think, taking into account that Ms M kept taking out loans she was only able this time to 
keep her account in credit because of these loans. Bering in mind the very high credit 
commitments against income, I dont think Everyday Loans carried out adequate checks. If it 
had its likely that it wouldnt have assessed this new loan as affordable.
Loan 4
When Ms M approached Everyday Loans for a further loan in April 2018, the high interest 
loan for £13,900 set out in the loan 3 application had shot up to £68,600. Her credit card had 
increased from £5,900 to £11,700. She had taken out further loans and store credit. She was 
now consistently overdrawn for most of the time. Nevertheless she had remortgaged her 
property for £156,000. This was used to pay off the aforesaid loans and credit cards. Burt 
the percentage of her income used for debt repayment was still 38%, a high figure. And 
having cleared her debts its difficult to see why she approached Everyday Loans again. She 
had a record of consistently having to take out loans to keep paying her debts and was 
running up credit card bills, despite earlier having said she was paying them off. Her record 
indicates that she was getting increasingly into debt, and this must partly be because she 
kept on taking on high interest loans, not only with Everyday Loans but also with other 
companies.
Her disposable income was calculated at £821 so apparently she could afford the new loan. 
But in light of her record and the fact that her financial position had got a lot worse since loan 
3 I think if Everyday Loans had taken account of her previous record its likely that it would 
have found this loan to be unsustainable. I dont think it made a fair lending decision.
Loan 5 Everyday Loans agrees with our adjudicators view that it didnt make a fair lending decision 
in respect of this loan, so I wont go into much further details except to note that Everyday 
Loans agrees that a 50% figure of credit commitments over income is too high. And I take 
into account that two thirds of her new mortgage payment actually relates to repayment of 
old credit commitments so the true figure would be around 62%.
Putting things right
Everyday Loans should:
Add up the total amount of money Ms M received as a result of being given loan 1 
(1106953899) loan 2 (1107645811), loan 3 (1108176324), loan 4 (1109999903) and 
loan 5 (11113427010).
Deduct all repayments Ms M made from this amount. 
If reworking Ms Ms loan accounts results in her having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then Everyday Loans should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the dates 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement. 
If theres still an outstanding balance, Everyday Loans should come to a reasonable 
repayment plan with Ms M.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Ms credit file if applicable in relation to 
loans 1,2,3,4 and 5.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Everyday Lending Limited trading as Everyday Loans to 
take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken 
off if she asks for one.
.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint and require Everyday Lending Limited trading as Everyday Loans to 
provide the remedy set out under Putting things right above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 February 2022.
