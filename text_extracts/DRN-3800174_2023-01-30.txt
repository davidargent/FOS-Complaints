The complaint
Mr H complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr H entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in October 2007 to 
pay for some holiday club membership points. The purchase price was £6,235 and the credit 
was provided in November 2007  the credit agreement said that he wouldnt be charged 
until six months from the purchase date. Mr H repaid the credit in May 2008. 
Mr H wrote to Barclays Partner Finance in April 2020 and said that it appeared that the credit 
intermediary wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange loans and he asked it to explain its 
position. Barclays Partner Finance said that it couldnt uphold his complaint because the 
purchase was made in November 2007 so his complaint was time-barred under the 
Limitation Act 1980. 
Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so he complained to this service. His representative 
wrote to this service and said, in summary and amongst other things, that the credit 
intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the membership points were 
misrepresented to Mr H, there was an unfair relationship between Mr H and Barclays Partner 
Finance pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, there is no evidence that a 
credit check was conducted before the loan was granted and the high interest rate was also 
an indication of an unfair relationship.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mr H entered into the credit agreement in October 2007, before the Financial Conduct 
Authority regulated consumer credit, so the credit intermediary didnt need authorisation from 
the Financial Conduct Authority. She thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to 
rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act and of the section 140A claim to turn them down. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was irresponsible.
Mr Hs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
 the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of Barclays Partner 
Finances decision;
 information was deliberately concealed from Mr H by the holiday company so the 
time limit for a claim is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation Act; 
 it wasnt until Mr H instructed it in 2018 that he was made aware of the unlawfulness 
of the credit;
 theres no evidence to show that the credit was provided responsibly;
 Barclays Partner Finance didnt adhere to its duty to assess Mr Hs creditworthiness 
as he made it aware of his financial liabilities at that time; and
 the interest rate is excessive.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Hs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
 we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
 Mr H first raised his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary with 
Barclays Partner Finance in April 2020 and I dont consider that his letter would 
properly be considered to be a complaint but Barclays Partner Finance said that his 
complaint was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 - Mr Hs representatives 
letter to this service then made claims under sections 75 and 140A so I need to 
consider whether the Limitation Act applies to those claims;
 Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs section 75 and 140A claims in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
 section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
 Mr Hs claim under section 75 is that the holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to him by the holiday company and that he wouldnt have bought the 
membership points if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the criteria for a claim 
under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to consider 
that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to 
not consider the claim;
 the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
 I consider that Mr H could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the membership points in October 2007 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the credit agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
 I consider that Mr Hs cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but he didnt write to Barclays Partner 
Finance until April 2020 and a misrepresentation claim wasnt made under section 75 until March 2021, more than thirteen years after the credit had been provided to him, 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
 Mr Hs representative says that Mr H only became aware that he could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance after he instructed it in 2018  
but when he had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes 
of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Hs 
claims;
 Mr Hs representative says that information was deliberately concealed from Mr H by 
the holiday company so the time limits are postponed under section 32;
 section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them;
 Mr Hs representative hasnt set out the information that it says was deliberately 
concealed from him and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these 
circumstances - I consider that many of the things that Mr H says werent right ought 
reasonably to have been known to him at the time of the sale - so I dont consider 
that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances; 
 Mr Hs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr H and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
 the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
 Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was repaid in May 2008  and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that the credit agreement continued after May 2008 so 
Mr H would have had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim under section 140A wasnt made 
until March 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his claim under section 140A is now 
also time-barred; 
 Mr Hs representative says that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange 
the credit but Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show 
that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange the credit for Mr H in 
October 2007;
 this services records show that the retailer identified on the credit agreement was 
covered under our consumer credit jurisdiction in October 2007  which it wouldnt 
have been had it not been granted a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair 
Trading - so I dont think that its unreasonable for me to conclude that the credit 
intermediary was likely to have held the requisite licence in October 2007 when the 
credit was provided to Mr H and that the credit agreement was enforceable;
 Mr Hs representative says that theres no evidence that a credit check was 
conducted before the credit was provided to Mr H or that the credit was provided responsibly  but the credit was provided to him in November 2007 and was repaid in 
May 2008 and Ive seen no evidence to show that he asked Barclays Partner 
Finance for any information about its credit checks before March 2021 and there was 
no reference to the credit checks in Mr Hs letter to Barclays Partner Finance in April 
2020;
 Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mr H when it was 
provided to him or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since then - I 
consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or 
the responsibility of Barclays Partner Finance in providing the credit would now be 
time-barred;
 Mr Hs representative says that the high interest rate that Mr H was expected to pay 
is also an indication of an unfair relationship and that the interest rate was excessive 
 but Mr H signed the credit agreement which clearly set out the rate of interest and 
immediately above his signature it says This is a Credit Agreement regulated by the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms  
the agreement also said that Mr H wouldnt be charged until six months from the 
purchase date  the amount of credit provided to him was £6,235 and the amount 
that he repaid in May 2008 was £6,235 so I dont consider that Mr H paid any interest 
to Barclays Partner Finance;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr H was unduly 
pressured into buying the points or entering into the credit agreement or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he didnt 
complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until March 2021 (more 
than thirteen years after he entered into the credit agreement) and I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about any such issues before then;
 Barclays Partner Finance said in response to Mr Hs letter about the credit 
intermediarys authorisation that his complaint was time-barred under the Limitation 
Act  I dont consider that hed made a complaint to it at that time under section 75 or 
section 140A but I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have 
said that any claim that he made under section 75 or section 140A would be time-
barred; and
 I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes had with his membership points but I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the money that he paid for the 
membership points, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 February 2023.
