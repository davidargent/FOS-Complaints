K820x#14complaint 
Mr H has complained about a short-term loan granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr H says he couldnt  afford  this loan and that QuickQuid didnt take 
appropriate steps to check whether he could afford it when  he took it out. Hes also said that 
QuickQuid shouldve done more to help him when he went  into financial difficulty. 
background
QuickQuid agreed one short-term loan for Mr H in December 2017.  The loan was repayable 
over three months, and the highest  monthly  repayment due was around £184. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Hs complaint already but didnt think the 
complaint should  be upheld.  He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out at the time of lending 
were proportionate, and didnt think it was unreasonable for it to have approved Mr Hs 
application based on the results of those checks.  
QuickQuid accepted the adjudicators findings. Mr H responded, disagreeing with the 
findings. So the case has been passed to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator at the time Mr H took out the above loans. 
Its regulations for lenders  are set out in its consumer credit sourcebook  (generally  referred  to 
as CONC). These regulations required lenders  to take reasonable steps to assess  the 
customers ability to meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable 
manner without the customer incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant 
adverse consequences.  -  CONC 5.3.1(2). 
CONC 5.3.1(7) defined  sustainable as being able to make repayments  without  undue  
difficulty. And explained this means  borrowers should be able to make their repayments on 
time and out of their income and savings without having to borrow  to meet  these repayments. 
In making this decision Ive considered whether or not QuickQuid did everything it shouldve  
when assessing  Mr Hs loan application.  And if it didnt, had it carried  out proportionate 
checks, whether  it wouldve realised  this loan may have been unaffordable  for him. Ive also 
looked at how QuickQuid treated Mr H when he told it he was experiencing financial 
difficulty. 
Having reviewed the case, I agree  with the adjudicators findings. I think  the checks 
QuickQuid carried out were proportionate,  and I think it was reasonable for QuickQuid  to 
have approved Mr Hs application based on what those checks  revealed. Ive also seen 
nothing to suggest QuickQuid needed  to go any further than it did at the time Mr H informed 
it that he was experiencing financial difficulty.  So Im not upholding Mr Hs case. I appreciate  
this is not what Mr H was hoping for, but I hope my explanation will make it clear  as to how 
and why Ive reached  this conclusion.
Ref: DRN28490092At the point Mr H applied  for his loan, QuickQuid  seem  to have asked him about his regular 
monthly income and regular monthly expenditure - which he seems to have disclosed as 
£1,380 and £525 respectively. And this expenditure figure, included £50 towards his credit 
commitments. So this wouldve initially suggested to QuickQuid that Mr H had a disposable 
monthly income of around £855.
Given this was Mr Hs first loan application  with QuickQuid, and the amount he was 
borrowing (£150) was relatively modest compared to the monthly income he declared 
(£1,380), I think at this stage QuickQuids checks went far enough. I can see that QuickQuid 
then went further  and reduced what  it called Mr Hs estimated  disposable income (EDI) to 
£468, as a result of additional checks it said it carried out  which it says showed his monthly  
credit commitments  to be around £581.
But I cant see from QuickQuids figures exactly how it reached a figure  of £468 though. It 
would seem to me that if £581 of credit commitments were deducted from Mr Hs monthly  
declared income of £1,380; along with his remaining declared monthly living  costs  of £475, 
he wouldve been  left with a disposable  monthly  income of around £325 at this time. 
But even if I was to conclude that Mr Hs disposable  monthly income was around £325, his 
highest monthly repayment  on the above  loan was just £184. So I still think it was reasonable 
for QuickQuid to have  concluded this loan was affordable for Mr H at the time he applied. So 
it follows that I dont  think  QuickQuid was wrong  in agreeing to the above loan for Mr H. 
financial difficulty
Mr H has also said that QuickQuid didnt  treat him fairly once hed advised  it he was 
experiencing financial difficulty as a result  of mental  health issues. And that its failure to act, 
caused him to have  to enter  into an Individual  Voluntary Arrangement  (IVA).
QuickQuid has said - that had it received documented evidence  of Mr Hs health condition at 
the time he was experiencing financial difficulty,  it wouldve opened  a legal case and 
requested proper documentation to verify  his situation, and then moved  forward  to relieve 
him of the account. But that it didnt  receive  this, and was not aware  of his health issues  until 
he complained  in August 2018.
Ive looked at the evidence both parties  have presented, and taken into account  what  our 
adjudicator said on this matter. Having done  so, in this instance I think QuickQuid did 
enough. Ill explain why.
The evidence provided by QuickQuid suggests  it first wrote to Mr H on 30 January 2018, 
advising him that his initial  payment was overdue, and that subsequently  a late fee of £15 
would be charged  his account.  It also directed him to advice that he could  take if he was 
experiencing financial difficulty. 
It doesnt appear that Mr H initially responded to this request, and subsequently QuickQuid 
wrote to him on several  occasions  throughout February 2018, asking him to get in touch 
immediately to resolve this matter,  and further  reminding  him that his repayment was 
overdue.
It appears that on 19 February  2018 Mr H got in touch  with QuickQuid, explaining that his 
debt was being handled by a debt charity under a debt relief order  (DRO), and instructed 
QuickQuid to cease  any further collections attempts. QuickQuid responded, asking for 
Ref: DRN28490093details of his solicitor or legal representative; his case  reference; and the date and location  of 
the DRO filing; and explained that all collection activity should  stop upon  receipt  of this. 
It doesnt appear that Mr H responded to this request, so in the absence of this information, 
QuickQuid continued  to pursue Mr H for the outstanding monies owed  throughout February 
and March 2018.
Mr H seems to have  contacted QuickQuid  again in late March 2018,  reiterating that it did not 
have his authority  to take any payments. To which QuickQuid  again replied, advising that it 
will continue collections procedures until such time that an arrangement is made,  and 
requested Mr H call in to set up a scheduled repayment plan. Mr H replied to his, simply  
requesting QuickQuid cancel the continuous payment authority (CPA) set up on his account.
QuickQuid informed Mr H that it had a right to collect payments from him. But said it was 
willing to set up a payment  arrangement  for the overdue balance, if provided  evidence of his 
income and expenditure. It also agreed  to cancel its CPA agreement, but explained that 
while the account remained in default, it would continue  its collection  activity. 
QuickQuid continued  to chase Mr H for payment  throughout March, April and May 2018,  
throughout which time, it does not appear  to have received a response from him. Until such  
time that he raised  a complaint about both QuickQuids  decision to lend, and its collection 
activity in August  2018.
QuickQuid acknowledged  this complaint, saying that it didnt feel it had done anything wrong, 
but requested  Mr H get in touch, as it may be able to agree a reduced settlement figure on 
his outstanding balance. Mr H again did not respond,  and QuickQuid wrote  to him shortly  
after, explaining  that its records now indicated hed entered into an IVA. So Ive considered 
all of this when deciding  what  I think about  how QuickQuid manage Mr Hs account while he 
was in financial difficulty.
 
QuickQuid had a duty to consider cases of financial  difficulty  positively and sympathetically. 
And I can see that throughout February to May 2018, QuickQuid requested  information  from 
Mr H regarding his income and expenditure, as well as details of the DRO hed mentioned.  It 
also explained that it would continue it collection activity until such  information was received,  
but agreed to cancel  his CPA as requested. It continued to ask Mr H for details of his income 
and expenditure  position  and the DRO he was applying for, but received a limited  response.  
On 19 April 2018 QuickQuid ceased  applying further  interest  and chares to Mr Hs account 
(albeit this was due to the fact it had reached the maximum  amount it was allowed to charge  
Mr H for his account), and it seems that no additional interest or charges have been  applied 
to his account since that date. 
Mr H, while  unhappy with how QuickQuid  has managed his account, has not provided any 
evidence to show that he forwarded QuickQuid  any of the information  it requested  to help it 
come to an arrangement  regarding the arrears on his account. Nor has he provided any 
evidence to show that he informed QuickQuid of his health issues  throughout this time, until 
he complained  in August 2018. 
So while I accept that Mr H has found himself in a difficult  position regarding his current 
financial circumstances, I dont think QuickQuid  was wrong  in agreeing  to Mr Hs loan 
application. And I havent seen enough  to suggest to me that QuickQuid needed to do any 
more, in terms of managing Mr Hs account  while in arrears, nor do I think it should have 
Ref: DRN28490094stopped applying interest or charges to his account sooner than it did. So Im not upholding 
Mr Hs complaint.
I would however, remind QuickQuid of its ongoing  requirement to treat Mr H positively and 
sympathetically in relation  to any financial difficulty he may still be facing. And it may wish to 
take into account Mr Hs ongoing health concerns  when doing so. It should also consider 
that Mr Hs told us hes currently  in an IVA, and ensure  that any collection activity it 
continues to pursue,  takes into account  the terms of this arrangement  where applicable. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Hs case.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2019.
