K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont  let him withdraw his 
remaining funds after it closed his account. He would like the money he says hes owed to 
be paid to him. He also complains that PayPal subsequently  gave him conflicting advice 
about whether  he could  withdraw his residual  funds from the account.  
background
Mr W has a number of accounts  with PayPal. On 2 September 2018 PayPal contacted Mr W 
to explain that, as a security precaution,  it was going  to place any payments he received into 
a pending balance and explained  how that worked.
Three weeks later it wrote  to confirm it would be closing Mr Ws accounts to protect us from 
potential financial losses.  It explained  its procedures for overseeing any funds in the 
account. It said it could  hold any outstanding money for up to 180 days to cover any potential 
disputes or chargeback reversals. 
Mr W said this wasnt fair and wanted access to his remaining funds.
PayPal confirmed Mr Ws account  was linked to other accounts that had outstanding 
issues. It said these  issues meant  it was necessary for PayPal  to terminate Mr Ws account 
in line with its user agreement.  
One of our investigators  looked into the complaint  and was satisfied  that PayPal had acted in 
line with the terms  and conditions by closing  the account and by holding  onto the funds. 
Mr W didnt think  PayPal had acted in accordance  with its procedures He said reversals had 
been made on the account shortly after the suspension was applied.  He also said that hed 
received an email from PayPal in October 2018 that said he could withdraw his funds but he 
then couldnt.  
The investigator said he was satisfied the email  made it clear the funds were in the reserve 
account and confirmed that PayPal  could hold money in the reserve account for the period it 
had already stated.  
Mr W didnt agree and asked for the case to be referred to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Mr W wants his funds released before  the 180 day deadline PayPal has given him. 
And I can see he feels strongly that he should have had access to his money when the 
account was suspended.  But I dont  think PayPal has acted incorrectly  here  which  I know 
will disappoint Mr W  so Ill explain why. 
PayPal has said that it initially looked  at Mr Ws account because  of its links to other  
accounts which it was concerned about. It said it carried out a review of the account and 
then decided to close it. Its not a matter for this service to tell PayPal how to manage and 
monitor its customer accounts.  Those are everyday legitimate  commercial  decisions PayPal 
Ref: DRN61131212is entitled to make. But I would expect it to demonstrate  how it reached those conclusions  
and Id also expect  it to explain its decision to Mr W. 
And in this case I think it has, because looking at the section titled  actions by PayPal it 
states if we have reason to believe  that you have engaged in any restricted activities, we 
may take various  actions to protect  PayPal, a user, a third party, or you from reversals, 
chargebacks, claims, fees, fines,  penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take 
include but are not limited  to the following..block your account  and/or hold any funds in the 
reserve account including without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by 
PayPal. It also explained that PayPal,  in its sole discretion,  may place  a reserve  on funds 
held in your account  when  PayPal  reasonably  believes there may be a higher than 
acceptable level of risk associated with your account.
So I think PayPal has been  clear that  if it suspects any restricted  activities  are carried out 
on an account it could  permanently suspend the account and hold any money for 180 days 
to cover any liabilities, which it has done.
I can see when PayPal  first wrote to Mr W about his account it advised  him it was going  to 
hold his funds  for 21 days, pending  him meeting its requirements on the account. Mr W said 
PayPal hadnt  followed its processes  because  it said he could have  his money after that 
time. But Ive seen how  when  PayPal  wasnt satisfied those requirements could be met it 
closed the account. It also explained how those funds could be held for up to 180 days   
with regular reviews, and it also explained its reasons for the closure and confirmed a right of 
appeal. So I think Mr W  was given the opportunity  to sort out any issues before the closure 
and was then made  aware of how his account would be managed going forward.  So I cant  
say PayPal has done anything wrong here as I think it explained what it was going  to do in 
line with its user agreement  which Mr W had to agree to before  opening  his account.
Mr W has also complained that PayPal sent him an email which told him he had funds to 
withdraw. But he wasnt able to withdraw them and then received another  email which 
confirmed he couldnt withdraw any money  at that time. Ive seen the emails and Im satisfied 
the first one did explain these funds were  a reserve amount and that if you have funds 
owing because of a limitation, we may try to cover money owed  to us from the reserve 
amount.  So I think PayPal made it clear these  funds  might not be available  based on what  it 
had previously told Mr W. I can see why Mr W might consider  the email  confusing,  but in any 
case the email that was sent the next day clearly explained the situation   that he couldnt 
withdraw funds  so I dont think PayPal did provide conflicting information.
I know Mr W has said he doesnt want the account reopened but just wants  to access  his 
funds. But I think PayPal  has acted  fairly  here by explaining what  it was going to do and then 
acting in line with its user agreement. Its clearly indicated why it might  need to hold the 
reserve money  which  seems reasonable to me, so Im not going to ask PayPal to do 
anything. 
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  given, my final decision is not to uphold Mr Ws complaint against 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2019.
