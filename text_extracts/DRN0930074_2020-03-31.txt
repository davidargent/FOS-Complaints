lent to him.

Loan 1 was a running  account credit  facility. That means Mr G was able to draw down funds 
up to his credit limit. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 7 to 14. He 
thought that Sunny should have realised the pattern  of borrowing was harmful by this point. 
Sunny didnt agree with that view. However, it accepted that it shouldnt have lent Mr G loans 
9 to 14 and it offered  to settle  the complaint on that basis. 
Mr G didnt accept Sunnys offer and so the matter has been passed to me to make  a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
Ref: DRN09300742different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Neither party disagreed with what  our adjudicator said in relation to loans 1 to 6. So, I have  
not considered  further whether that lending was irresponsible. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that were so, Sunny  should  have realised that it ought not to have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I agree with our adjudicator  that this point 
was reached by loan 7. I say this because:
By now,  Sunny ought to have realised  Mr G was not managing  to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out 7 loans in around  15 months, including  a running  
account facility  with multiple  drawdowns. His first instalment loan was for £250  and 
loan 7 was for £300. Sunny should  have realised  that Mr G was not likely borrowing 
to meet  a temporary shortfall  in his income, but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 7 onwards,  Mr G was provided  with further borrowing  within  a very short  
period of time of repaying a previous loan. 
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed. Although loan 14 was 
for £150, Mr G still had two significant  loans outstanding  loan 11 was for £500 and 
loan 13 was for £450.  Mr  G had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which he borrowed was likely to have 
had negative implications on his ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 14 and Sunny will need to take action 
to put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 7 to 14; 
Ref: DRN09300743pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loans  7 to 14 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 7 to 14 must be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
