Complaint
Mr W has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable and worsened his financial 
position.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr W with a loan for £1,000.00 in February 2019. This loan had an 
APR of 169.9% and a term of 18 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£1,919.34, including interest, fees and charges of £919.34, was due to be repaid in 18 
monthly instalments of just over £105. 
118 118 Money then provided Mr W with a second loan for £2,000.00 in August 2020. This 
loan had an APR of 44.9% and a term of 12 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £2,434.32, including interest, fees and charges of £434.32, was due to be repaid in 
12 monthly instalments of just over £200. 
Finally, 118 118 Money provided Mr W with a third loan for £5,000.00 in July 2022. This loan 
had an APR of 79.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £8,676.72, including interest, fees and charges of £3,676.72, was due to be repaid 
in 24 monthly instalments of just over £360. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ws complaint and she eventually concluded that 118 
118 Money didnt do anything wrong when providing loans 1 and 2 but that it ought to have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided Mr W with loan 3. Mr W accepted our adjudicators 
assessment but 118 118 Money disagreed with the outcome on loan 3. So the case was 
passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
As the parties are in agreement with the outcome reached on loans 1 and 2, this decision is 
only looking at whether 118 118 Money acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr W when 
providing loan 3. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Ws complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Ws complaint. Ill 
explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr W could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
When Mr W approached 118 118 Money in July 2022 he was approaching for his third loan 
and this was for significantly more than what Mr W had previously borrowed and to some 
extent successfully repaid. I think that this coupled with the fact that the payments to this 
loan would be taking up a reasonable proportion of his declared monthly income meant that 
118 118 Money ought to have found out more about more about Mr W before determining 
that this loan was affordable for him. 
I think further checks would have extended into finding out more about Mr Ws expenditure. 
And if 118 118 Money had done this here, Im persuaded that it would have seen that Mr W 
was already in a difficult financial position at the time and also found out why this was the 
case. Im also satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than not 
have shown 118 118 Money that Mr Ws existing precarious financial position was because 
he was struggling financially. 
So Im persuaded by what Mr W has said about already being in a difficult financial position 
at the time and the reasons for this. And as reasonable and proportionate checks should 
have extended into finding out more about Mr Ws income and expenditure, Im satisfied that 
they would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided 
loan 3 to Mr W. As 118 118 Money provided Mr W with loan 3, notwithstanding this, Im 
satisfied it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards him. 
Mr W ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan he shouldnt have been provided 
with in the first place. So Im satisfied that Mr W lost out because of what 118 118 Money did 
wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr W
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr W by:
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 3 from the outset. The 
payments Mr W made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £5,000.00 originally lent. If 
Mr W has already paid more than £5,000.00 on loan 3 then 118 118 Money should 
treat any extra as overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to             
Mr W;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Mr W to the date of settlement
if no outstanding balance remains on loan 3 after all adjustments have been made, 
all adverse information 118 118 Money recorded about loan 3 should be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im partially upholding Mr Ws complaint. Madison CF UK 
Limited should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2023.
