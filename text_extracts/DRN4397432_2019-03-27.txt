K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc cant find documents  for additional  
lending made  to him. He believes his case was closed in January  2015 and that NatWest 
wouldnt be pursuing him for his outstanding  debt. But hes recently received letters  showing 
the amounts he owes and asking for his proposals  to repay  the debt.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 22 February  2019, a copy extract of which  is attached 
and forms part of this final decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I was proposing to uphold  Mr Ss complaint in 
part.
I invited both parties to let me have any further  submissions before I reached  a final 
decision.
NatWest has agreed to my provisional  decision but I havent  had any further comments  from 
Mr S.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I havent  received any further evidence  or arguments for consideration, I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold  this 
complaint in part.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc in 
part and to resolve matters I direct  National Westminster  Bank  Plc to pay £100  
compensation to Mr S.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2019.

complaint
Mr S complains that National  Westminster  Bank Plc cant find documents  for additional  lending made  
to him. He believes his case was closed in January 2015 and that NatWest wouldnt  be pursuing him 
for his outstanding debt. But hes recently received  letters showing the amounts he owes and asking  
for his proposals to repay the debt.
background
NatWest passed Mr Ss debt to its solicitors  to deal with. Mr S says he rang NatWests solicitors  in 
approximately May 2015 when he was told that copies of his credit agreements  couldnt be found, 
that theyd resolved the issue with NatWest and that he shouldnt be concerned.
But in approximately November  2017 he received  a statement  in a handwritten envelope and with no 
explanation showing that he still owed money to NatWest. So he contacted NatWest and raised a 
complaint. He says this has been very stressful and alarming as his records cant  be found  and 
NatWest hasnt taken his health issues and personal circumstances into account.
NatWest explained that its solicitors stopped dealing with Mr Ss accounts  in June 2017. 
However, NatWest  didnt receive  any report from its solicitors to confirm theyd  closed his file. So 
this is why there  was no contact  from NatWest  or its solicitors  for some  time.  NatWest apologised  for 
any inconvenience  caused.
Mr S is unhappy with NatWests response so he brought his complaint to this service. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint  should be upheld.
Shed seen nothing to suggest  Mr Ss debt had been written off. She thought  the issue had arisen  
because NatWest  didnt receive notification from its solicitors when they passed the account back 
to NatWest. She understood  that the delay was inconvenient to Mr S but this didnt mean his debt 
had been written off.
And although NatWest hasnt been able to find the original credit agreements, its records show Mr Ss 
lending history  so she didnt doubt that NatWest had lent the money  to him.
Mr S doesnt agree  with the investigator  and has asked  for an ombudsmans decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sympathetic to the position Mr S finds himself in. And Im sorry to hear he has on-going health 
issues and is now unable to work.
Im sorry to disappoint  Mr S but other than his recollection  of events, Im afraid  Ive seen nothing  
to suggest NatWest agreed to write off his debt.
Its not in dispute that NatWest hasnt been unable  to find Mr Ss credit agreements  to show the 
additional lending to him. But unfortunately  this doesnt mean that the debt is extinguished. And 
because NatWests  records show Mr Ss lending history  I have  no reason to doubt that additional  
monies were lent to him.
NatWest apologised  for the delay in contacting Mr S - due to it being  unaware its solicitors had 
closed his file. But I can understand Mr Ss frustration  when he wasnt contacted  for so long. And I 
can see how this, together with his recollection of events, might  lead him to think his debt had been 
written off. But, as Ive explained above  Ive seen nothing to suggest  this is the case.
Ref: DRN43974323However, I think NatWest should have  contacted Mr S sooner than it did about  the outstanding  
balances on his accounts. And in the circumstances  I consider it appropriate to award  £100 to Mr S 
for the trouble and upset  caused as a result of NatWests delay in contacting him about his 
outstanding debt. But I dont consider it appropriate to award any additional  amount because Im 
satisfied Mr S hasnt lost out financially. NatWest has confirmed it hasnt charged interest on Mr Ss 
debt since the end of 2013  when his accounts were transferred to recoveries.
I can see that NatWest  has asked Mr S for his proposals for repayment  of the debt. To allow NatWest 
to assess how Mr Ss health issues impact on his ability to repay the debt, he should  contact 
NatWest to discuss this further.
my provisional  decision
I provisionally direct National Westminster Bank  Plc to pay £100 compensation  to Mr S for the 
trouble and upset caused as a result of its poor service.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject 
my decision  before 8 March 2019.
