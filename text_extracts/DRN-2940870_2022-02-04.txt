The complaint
Mr R complains about HDI Global Specialty SEs handling of his buildings insurance claim
All references to HDI Global also include its agents
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint for these reasons:
The policy says HDI will not pay for any pre-existing damage occurring before the
commencement of the policy. The policy was originally taken out around 2013.
HDI provided photographs of the damage from the time of the claim but has also
provided google earth images that show evidence of damage to the garage prior to 
this.
In particular the lintel at the front door of the garage is showing cracking and gaps in 
the brickwork in google earth images going back as far as 2009.
Although the extent of the damage appears to have increased when reported around
November 2019, I think its more likely than not the issues have existed for some 
time, and prior to the policys inception. So, I dont think HDI have acted unfairly in 
applying the exclusion.
As I think HDI have applied this exclusion fairly to decline the claim, I wont be
commenting on the other exclusions raised by it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 March 2022.
