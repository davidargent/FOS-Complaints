K820x#14complaint
Ms F has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) will not refund any 
commission it received from her mortgage payment  protection insurance (PPI) premiums.
background
In 2018, Ms F contacted  NatWest to complain about  the level of undisclosed commission  
(and profit share) received by NatWest on her PPI policy  attached to a mortgage. 
NatWest explained  to Ms F that it had already  looked into the sale of her PPI and had upheld 
Ms Fs complaint. 
NatWest say that Ms F had a successful  claim under the policy totalling £3,145.00. And this 
was more than she had paid for the PPI, which was £1,650.15. So NatWest considered that 
as Ms Fs claim amount was greater than her PPI compensation  she wasnt  due anything. 
NatWest explained  that as it had already fully upheld Ms Fs complaint it didnt need to do 
anything further  in relation to the amount  of commission and profit  share it received for the 
PPI policy.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Ms F disagreed and so the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provided  guidance and rules on how businesses  
should approach compensation for PPI when a consumer  complains  about  the sale of PPI. It 
referred to a two-step  approach.  
The first was that a business should  look to see whether a policy was mis-sold and whether 
the consumer  would  not otherwise have bought  the policy they did. 
And if the policy wasnt mis-sold, the second  step was to look to see whether  the level of 
undisclosed commission (and profit share) received by the business  created an unfair 
relationship between the consumer and the business.
The rules  say that a business doesnt need to consider the commission  (and profit  share)  
charged if it upheld  the consumers  complaint that PPI had been  mis-sold (step  1). In other 
words, if a business finds a consumer  wouldnt  have  bought  the PPI they did and offers  to 
put things right on that basis,  it doesnt need to go on to look at any complaint about  
commission (step 2).
So here, Im satisfied Ms F made  a complaint about a mis-sale  of PPI, which NatWest 
investigated and upheld in 2018.  
But because Ms F had claimed more under the policy than what she had paid for it, she 
wasnt owed anything.
Ref: DRN72093812As NatWest accepted  the PPI policy was mis-sold,  it should  have  tried to put Ms F in the 
financial position she would have been in if she hadnt taken it out (so far as is possible). 
Importantly here, if Ms F hadnt had PPI, she wouldnt have been able to make her claim. 
So I think it was fair for NatWest to deduct the amount Ms F received when she made  her 
claim from any compensation. And because Ms Fs claims totalled more  than her PPI 
compensation, NatWest  didnt need  to pay her anything.
As NatWest had investigated the sale of the policy and upheld it - albeit with no 
compensation due to Ms F, NatWest  didnt have to go on and consider whether the 
relationship was unfair.  
Ive thought about whether theres anything about  Ms Fs particular complaint and 
circumstances that means NatWest  should do something different and I dont think  there is. 
NatWest has done  what the rules  it must  follow tell it to do. So I wont  be telling NatWest  to 
do anything more.  
In passing I want  to mention that even  if the complaint hadnt been  upheld and NatWest 
were required  to look at the commission as step 2, the commission  it received was below 
50% - so Ms F wouldnt have been  entitled to a payment anyway. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Ms Fs complaint and NatWest doesnt  need to 
do anything further.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 October  2019.
