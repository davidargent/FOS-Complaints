K821x#15complaint
Miss J complains  that Harvey  & Thompson Limited lent to her in an irresponsible  manner.
background 
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision of
3 February 2020,  an extract  of which  is attached and forms part of this final decision. So, I 
wont repeat  that information here.  
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I couldnt reach a conclusion  about loans before 
6 April 2007 - loans one to nine in the appendix  to my provisional decision. But I  could take 
those loans into account as part of the background to the complaint. I said that H&T 
shouldnt have given  Miss J loans 10 to 16 and set out what I intended to direct it to do to put 
matters right.
responses to my provisional  decision
Miss J accepted my provisional decision. H&T said that the reason it asked an ombudsman  
to look at this complaint  was to establish  some consistency or rationale  in relation to the 
appropriate gap between periods of lending after which redress  is not due. 
 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I explained in my provisional decision  why a gap of less than four months between loans 10 
and 11 didnt break the chain of lending in this case. I took into account the period over 
which Miss J borrowed  from H&T and the amounts she borrowed. I dont think I can usefully 
add to what Ive already  said about that. Im satisfied that, in this case, its fair to conclude  
that there  was one chain of lending. 
Ive considered what H&T has said but I see no reason  to depart from the conclusions  I 
reached in my provisional decision. So, for the reasons  Ive explained, I dont think that H&T 
should have given Miss J loans  10 to 16. 
Ref: DRN85418272my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Js complaint in part. I now require
Harvey & Thompson  Limited to:
refund  all interest and charges Miss J paid on loans 10 to 16 and write off any
outstanding interest  and charges on loan 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct from the refund above  any capital  sum still due in relation to loan 12 and pay 
Miss J the balance, if any. If there remains an outstanding balance  owed to H&T in 
relation to loans 12, H&T should agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss J;
the number  of loans taken from loan ten onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 10, 11, 13, 14 , 15 and 16 should  
be removed from Miss Js credit file. Entries about  loan 12 should be removed once 
the capital owing on that loan has been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires H&T to take off tax from this interest.  H&T must give
Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off, if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.

complaint
Miss J complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited lent to her in an irresponsible manner.
background
H&T gave  Miss J 13 pay day advance, cheque loans and three  instalment loans between  April 2006  
and April 2009. Thats different from whats been said before,  as Ive identified an additional loan Miss 
J took out in March  2008.
The loan agreements arent available but I understand that the pay day advance, cheque  loans 
involved Miss J giving  H&T a guaranteed cheque. H&T then gave Miss J a cash advance  to the 
value of the cheque,  less its charge. Miss J had the option of repaying the cash, allowing the 
cheque to be cashed or extending the cheque for another 30 days  by paying  the charge owed.
I understand  that the instalment loans were repayable  in monthly instalments.
Loans one to 11 and 13-16  were repaid by Miss J or otherwise settled  but loan 12 remains 
outstanding. A summary of Miss Js borrowing  from H &T is shown as an appendix  to this decision. 
Ive shown  both types of loans consecutively. The newly  identified loan is loan 13.
Miss J says that when she applied  for the loans, she needed them for everyday  essentials  and that 
H&T didnt tell her that the loans werent suitable  for that. She says that she had to borrow 
repeatedly. Miss J says that she struggled to make the repayments, which was very worrying.  She 
wants a refund of interest and charges, with interest and adverse information removed  from her 
credit file.
One of our adjudicators assessed the complaint. She said that this service couldnt  
determine whether H&T shouldnt have given Miss J loans that she took out before
6 April 2007, as this type of lending  didnt come within our jurisdiction until that date. But we
could consider those loans by way of background.
The adjudicator said that H&T shouldnt have loaned  to Miss J from May 2007  loan 10 on the 
appendix. She set out what she thought it should  do to put matters right.
H&T agreed with most  of the adjudicators view but didnt  agree that it was wrong to give Miss J the 
loan in October  2007   loan 11 in the appendix.  It said that there was a gap in lending  of four 
months between Miss J repaying the previous loan in June 2007 and taking out a new loan in 
October 2007.
The adjudicator didnt change her view. As there was no agreement between the parties, the 
complaint was passed  to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
Ref: DRN85418274H&T needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice, this 
means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss J could repay the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that H&T should fairly and reasonably have  done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
The loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow 
this is the case. A customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it 
follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments  sustainably if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
There were  industry standards in 2007  such as the FLA Lending Code  that, in some respects, 
were based  on the same  principles as current regulations. In any event, a lender should treat its 
customers reasonably.
As the adjudicator explained, this type of lending  didnt come within our jurisdiction until
6 April 2007. So, I cant reach a conclusion about loans  before that date but I can take them into 
account as part of the background  to the complaint. This service has jurisdiction to deal with Miss 
Js complaint about loans ten to 16.
H&T has accepted the adjudicators view except  in relation to the loan taken out in
October 2007  loan 11. So, loan 11 remains  in dispute. H&T says that there was a gap in lending 
of four months between Miss J repaying the previous loan in June  2007 and taking out loan 11 in 
October 2007. It says that its view is consistent with this services previous treatment of gaps in 
lending.
Ive thought carefully about  what  H&T has said. I dont agree that a gap of less than four months 
between these  two loans was such that the chain of lending was broken. I dont think that gap meant 
that H&T was entitled to treat Miss J as a new borrower. I say that because  by October 2007, Miss J 
had been borrowing  from H&T without  a significant break for around 18 months.  Considered in that 
context, I dont think that a gap of less than four months is such that H&T could proceed on the basis 
that the new loan bore no relation  to Miss Js previous  borrowing.
Ref: DRN85418275In addition,  the amount  of the loans didnt  decrease substantially until the last loan. That 
indicates that Miss J was maintaining her level of indebtedness to H&T.
H&T has said that this service ordinarily considers this sort of gap as significant. I dont think  thats 
the case. In any event, each  case is considered  on its own facts. Here, I think  there was one chain of 
lending.
I agree with the adjudicator  that the pattern  of lending  from loan ten in May 2007 was such that H&T 
should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise  harmful. And so 
H&T should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. I think  that the same 
reasoning applies to the additional loan Ive identified  in March 2008.
H&T accepted the adjudicators view.  As I dont  agree  with H&Ts  arguments about the loan Miss J 
took out in October 2007, I think  the adjudicators  proposed resolution of this case is fair and 
reasonable with the addition of loan 13.
For the reasons  set out above and previously  explained by the adjudicator, Im upholding the 
complaint from loan 10 and H&T should put things right.
putting things right  what H&T needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss J paid on loans  10 to 16 and write  off any 
outstanding interest and charges on loan 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct  from the refund  above any capital sum still due in relation to loan 12 and pay Miss J 
the balance, if any. If there remains an outstanding balance owed to H&T in relation to loans 
12, H&T should agree  an affordable repayment plan with Miss J;
the number of loans taken from loan ten onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10, 11, 13, 14 , 15 and 16 should  be removed 
from Miss Js credit  file. Entries about loan 12 should be removed  once the capital owing  on 
that loan has been  repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  H&T to take off tax from this interest.  H&T must  give
Miss J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off, if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  I intend to uphold Miss Js complaint in part and to direct
Harvey & Thompson Limited to take the steps Ive indicted  above.
