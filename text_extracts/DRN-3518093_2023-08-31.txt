The complaint
Mrs W complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claim that she made to it for a refund of the money that she paid 
for some holiday club membership points. Her husband is also involved in her complaint and 
shes being represented by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs W and her husband had entered into a purchase agreement in February 2010 with a 
holiday company to upgrade their holiday club membership points. The total price payable 
for those points was £5,750. They entered into another purchase agreement with the holiday 
company in November 2010 to buy 60,000 more holiday club membership points. The 
purchase price for the additional points was £7,050 and I understand that Mrs W entered into 
a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance and used £7,050 of the credit that 
was provided to her to pay for those points. The credit was on buy now  pay later terms so 
the purchase wasnt charged to her account until six months later. Barclays Partner Finance 
says that Mrs W repaid the credit in May 2011.
Mrs Ws representative made a claim, on behalf of Mrs W, to Barclays Partner Finance 
under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in October 2020 about the November 
2010 purchase. It said that the points were misrepresented to Mrs W and her husband, the 
misleading statements and sales practices adopted by the holiday company were unlawful, 
unconscionable, unreasonable and unfair, there had been irresponsible lending and no 
affordability checks were carried out. As no response was received from Barclays Partner 
Finance a complaint was made to this service. Mrs Ws complaint form referred to claims 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.
This service provided details of the compliant to Barclays Partner Finance. It said that it 
hadnt been aware of Mrs Ws claim and then issued a response to it. It said that Mrs W was 
out of time to bring any claim in respect of the issues that she claimed to have happened at 
the point of sale.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ws complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mrs Ws claim under section 
140A to turn it down and he said that he hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to suggest 
that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs W.
Mrs Ws representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that: Mrs W first became aware 
that she had cause for complaint when she took legal advice in 2017; she complained within 
three years of becoming aware that she had cause to complain; and its satisfied that this 
service does have jurisdiction to consider her complaint. It has also provided further reasons 
that it considers that Mrs Ws relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ws complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claim that 
shed made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six 
years of Barclays Partner Finance turning down that claim - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to her claim;
Mrs Ws claim was made under section 140A about the November 2010 purchase 
but her complaint form referred to claims under sections 75 and 140A - Im not 
determining the outcome of her claims in this decision as only a court would be able 
to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to 
the claim that was made to it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
I understand that the claim under section 75 referred to in Mrs Ws complaint form is 
that the membership points were misrepresented to her and her husband and that 
they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be 
expected to consider a claim that was made to it unless the claim was brought 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be 
entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
Mrs W would have been able to make a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about any misrepresentations that could have induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points no later than November 2010 as that 
was the latest time that any misrepresentations about those membership points 
would have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when Mrs W used the credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance (though 
Ive not been provided with a copy of the credit card agreement and am relying on 
the information contained in a credit card account summary which shows a purchase 
in November 2010 for £7,050);
I consider that Mrs Ws cause of action would have accrued at that time, so she 
would have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either 
the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim 
wasnt made under section 75 until October 2020, nearly ten years later which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays 
Partner Finance would have a defence to any misrepresentation claim and I find that 
it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected such a claim;Mrs Ws representative says that Mrs W only became aware that they could make a 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance after she took legal advice in 2017  but when she 
had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs Ws 
claims;
Mrs Ws representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs W 
and Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
the buy now  pay later period for Mrs Ws November 2010 purchase ended in May 
2011 and Barclays Partner Finance says that Mrs W repaid the credit in May 2011 - 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit card agreement continued after May 
2011 so Im satisfied that the credit was repaid in May 2011and that the credit 
agreement ended then;
Mrs W would have had six years from May 2011 to bring a section 140A claim 
against Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until October 2020, 
more than nine years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to her 
section 140A claim and I find that it was reasonable for it to reject the claim;
Mrs Ws representative says that the lending was irresponsible and no affordability 
checks were carried out but its provided no further evidence to show that the credit 
wasnt affordable for Mrs W in November 2010 or that it was irresponsible for 
Barclays Partner Finance to have provided her with credit at that time;
Mrs W used £7,050 of the credit that was made available to her to pay for the 
membership points that she and her husband bought in November 2010 and she 
repaid that credit when the buy now  pay later period ended six months later in 
May 2011;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mrs W when it was 
made available to her or that she asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information 
about its affordability assessment before October 2020  as the credit was provided 
to her in November 2010 and was repaid in May 2011, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about the affordability of the 
credit or about the lending being irresponsible before then;
Barclays Partner Finance issued its response to Mrs Ws claim in April 2021 and I 
consider that its response was fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mrs W for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership points but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the 
money that she paid under the credit card agreement, to pay her any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2023.
