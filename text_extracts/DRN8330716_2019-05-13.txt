K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd (trading as Aqua)  irresponsibly gave him a credit card in 
2016 given his circumstances and that it subsequently sold his account to a third party. He 
wants to deal with NewDay  not the third party, wants the debt written off and his credit file 
amended.
background
NewDay said in its final response that as a responsible lender it carries out checks  when 
deciding to offer credit.  It considered the information  Mr R gave and credit reference agency  
information. Mr R met its acceptance criteria and he was given a card with a limit appropriate 
to his circumstances. Itd later assisted  by putting him on an affordable repayment plan. And 
in line with its terms and conditions itd subsequently sold the account  to a third party  in 
March 2017. 
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld.  She said:
It doesnt appear Mr R told NewDay of his personal health issues. And we wouldnt 
expect it to ask about health issues in the online application. 
But when  he told it of other problems it agreed  a reduced payment plan. NewDay 
subsequently defaulted the account and said it might sell the account. But it said the 
new owner would allow the payment plan to continue. Mr R made some payments 
but then broke the repayment  plan.  It was his responsibility to maintain the 
repayment plan.  As Mr R didnt meet his contractual  minimum payments, NewDay 
was entitled to default the account. 
NewDay must treat a consumer in financial difficulties positively and sympathetically. 
It did so in Mr Rs case. And it has on obligation to accurately  report to credit  
reference agencies  how his account has been  managed. So, she cant suggest it 
should remove the default and wont be asking NewDay to do any more.
Mr R doesnt agree and has asked for an ombudsman review.  He says he was known to 
NewDay as a vulnerable customer.  It didnt contact him when  he failed to make  payments. 
He remains unhappy  the debt was sold to a third party. Hes also unhappy that his account  
has continued to be defaulted while this complaint is ongoing.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its up to NewDay to decide who it deals with and gives credit  to. Thats  a matter of it making  
a commercial decision which we wouldnt normally  interfere with. But wed expect  it to carry 
out proportionate checks before doing so.
Here NewDay  says it carried out checks and considered what  Mr R had said in his 
application together with information from credit  reference agencies.  I think this was 
proportionate and appropriate. I also agree with the investigator that we wouldnt expect 
NewDay to have specifically asked about health issues in the application process.
Ref: DRN83307162What was asked  and the lending criteria  used  to assess  Mr Rs application are matters  for 
NewDay to decide  upon. And its decision to give him a card with what it considered  was an 
appropriate limit is an example  of it exercising its commercial judgement  in which  we 
wouldnt normally interfere.
Once NewDay subsequently became aware of Mr Rs financial and other difficulties I think  it 
also acted positively and sympathetically by agreeing  a reduced repayment plan. 
It was Mr Rs responsibility to ensure he kept to the plan or contacted NewDay  again.  And I 
dont think NewDay did anything wrong  in the way it communicated with Mr R or by selling 
his account to the third party, as it said it could do and was in line with the accounts terms 
and conditions.
NewDay also acted reasonably by registering the default as Mr R hadnt kept to the 
minimum required payments under the original agreement.  And it also had an obligation to 
ensure the information recorded  on Mr Rs credit file accurately reflected the conduct of his 
account.
Taking everything into account  I think NewDay has acted fairly throughout and I dont think 
its done anything  wrong. As a result I dont think I can fairly or reasonably  ask it to refund 
anything to Mr R or amend his credit file as hed like.
Mr R also now complains that his credit record is still being  affected while this complaint is 
ongoing. But as his account  and debt were sold to a third party in 2017, I cant hold NewDay 
responsible for whats happened since then. If Mr R remains unhappy he will need to contact 
the third party  directly.
Overall, although I sympathise with the problems  Mr R has experienced and recognise his 
strength of feeling,  I dont think I can fairly  or reasonably ask NewDay to do anything  more 
as hed like. And I dont  see any compelling  reason to change the proposed outcome in this 
case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 June  2019.
