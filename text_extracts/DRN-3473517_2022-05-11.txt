The complaint
Mr H has complained that Madison CF UK Limited (118 118 Money) provided him with two 
unaffordable loans.
What happened
118 118 Money provided Mr H with 2 loans. The details of these are given below:

I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in March 2022. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
Were 118 118 Moneys checks reasonable and proportionate for the 2 loans?
Mr H took out his first loan with 118 118 Money in January 2018. 118 118 Money says that it 
carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr H prior to providing him with this 
loan. It says it also carried out a credit check. It said the information gathered were then 
assessed against its scorecard. I can see that Mr H declared that he was earning around 
£2000 a month. I can then see from a document submitted by 118 118 Money that Mr H 
declared his expenditure to be around £735. Mr H declared his credit commitments to be 
£400 as part of this. But I havent seen anything further as to how 118 118 Money used the 
information that it gathered.  
Ive carefully considered what 118 118 Money has said. But when I consider what I have 
already mentioned about the lack of detail it has provided regarding how it assessed the 
information it gathered and also the amount of the loan Mr H had asked for and the length of 
the term, I think that 118 118 Money needed to take steps to verify Mr Hs monthly 
expenditure. I think in particular it should have taken more steps to assess Mr Hs credit 
commitments and find out more about them. It would have seen on the credit check that it 
carried out that Mr H was in arrears on a loan and had been for around 5 months. He was 
also in arrears on a credit card. So, I dont think it should have relied just on the information it 
had in front of it, I think it should have carried out further checks to verify what he said with 
regards to loan 1.
Mr H took out his second loan in December 2018 and used part of this loan to pay off the 
first loan. Again, 118 118 Money asked Mr H for details of his income. I can see that it has 
recorded down an income figure of £2000 and it has used the same expenditure figure of 
£735. Again, I consider there is a lack of detail here about how it might have assessed the 
information it gathered. I can also see that Mr H was in arrears on a credit and another credit 
card was now being reported as a delinquent account. When I consider the limited amount of 
information it had gathered on Mr Hs expenditure along with the fact this was now his 
second loan application with it and he was looking to lend for another 24 months, I think it 
ought to have considered further checks here, especially in light of what was showing on the 
credit search. I think the checks it carried out were not proportionate for loan 2 either.
I dont currently think that the checks 118 118 Money carried out before providing Mr H with 
his two loans were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to 118 118 Money that Mr H 
would have been unable to repay the two loans?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before loans 1 and 2 were 
provided, I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So, I need to decide whether it is 
more likely than not that proportionate checks would have told 118 118 Money that Mr H 
would have been unable to sustainably repay the two loans.
118 118 Money was required to establish whether Mr H could make his loan repayments 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments 
were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation when it agreed to lend 
to him on both occasions.
Mr H has provided our service with a screenshot of part of a bank statement leading up to 
him being granted loan 1. This is only an extract of his statements, but I think I can give 
some weight to what I can see on it. I can see that Mr H had made payments on 2 short term 
loans on the same day he was requesting loan 1 from 118 118 Money. One of these loans 
was listed on the credit search it had carried out but the other was not. So, Mr H was already 
repaying 2 short term loans and was applying to 118 118 Money for a third. I can also see 
that Mr H was deep into his overdraft and had a large balance to repay across two credit 
cards. As I have already mentioned Mr H was in arrears on 2 of his accounts as well. I think 
all of this is showing me that Mr H was struggling to manage his finances. If 118 118 Money 
had carried out proportionate checks, I think it is more likely than not it would have 
uncovered this, and then not lent to Mr H. So, I currently uphold Mr Hs complaint about loan 
1.
I can see that Mr Hs finances did not improve by the time he had applied for loan 2. His 
overall unsecured debt had, in a short space of time, increased further. He was in arrears on 
a credit card account and now one of his accounts was being reported as delinquent. It is 
more likely than not, on seeing this that Mr H was still having problems managing his 
finances, and this would have been uncovered if 118 118 Money had carried out further 
checks.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would 
more likely than not have shown 118 118 Money that Mr H would not have been able to 
sustainably repay either loan 1 or loan 2. So, Im satisfied that 118 118 Moneys failure to 
carry out proportionate checks resulted in it unfairly providing these loans to Mr H.
So, it follows that I currently think that 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. 118 118 Money responded and said it accepts the provisional 
decision. Mr H has not provided any further comments.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Mr H has not made any new points for me to respond to and 118 118 Money has accepted 
my findings. So, as neither party has anything further to add that I feel I need to comment 
on or that will change the outcome of this complaint, I dont see any reason to depart from 
my findings within my provisional decision. With that being the case, I uphold Mr Hs 
complaint.  
Putting things right 
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr H to repay the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because he has had the benefit of that lending. But as I have concluded 118 118 Money 
shouldnt have provided the loans, so it should look to remove the interest and fees from the 
principal amount. 
118 118 Money should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges on loans 1-2 and treat all the payments Mr H 
has made as payments towards the capital for each of these loans.
If reworking Mr Hs loan accounts results in him having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loans 1-
2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money should give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
