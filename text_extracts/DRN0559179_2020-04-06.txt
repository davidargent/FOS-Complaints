K820x#14complaint
Mr D and Mr J complain that Royal  & Sun Alliance Insurance  plc (trading as MORE TH>N) is 
responsible for poor service and damage under their home emergency insurance.
background
Mr D had MORE Th>N home  buildings  and contents  insurance.  It included the optional extra 
of home  emergency  cover  up to a limit of £1,000.00. Mr J was a joint policyholder.
Mr D and Mr J had a heated towel rail in the main bathroom. It was plumbed in to the central 
heating radiator system. The towel rail was leaking on Saturday  10 November 2018. Mr D 
called for help under the home emergency cover. 
He dealt with a helpline of a company  for whose actions I hold MORE TH>N responsible. 
Where I refer to MORE TH>N I include  that company. It struggled to find a local plumber. Mr 
D was expecting a visit on 15 November. But the helpline company said a plumber would 
visit on Friday 16 November 2018.  Mr D complained.
The helpline company sent him £100.00. 
On 30 November 2018 MORE TH>N said if Mr D instructed  a plumber it would reimburse  
the cost. It gave him some links to three well-known websites for reliable tradesmen. 
Through one of the websites, Mr D contacted a plumber who fixed the leak on 10 December 
2018. He wouldve charged £140.00.  Unfortunately  he had allowed dirty radiator water to 
escape in the bathroom. So the plumber waived  any charge.
Mr D cleaned up the bathroom but couldnt  remove a dark stain  on the wall. He complained 
to MORE TH>N.
In December 2018 MORE TH>N sent him £140.00  and £60.00, a total of £200.00. With the 
£100.00 from the helpline Mr D had received £300.00.
Mr D incurred a £190.00 invoice dated 6 February 2019 for re-painting  the bathroom walls 
and ceiling. 
When he brought his complaint to us, Mr D drew  a distinction between  the background to his 
complaint and his actual  complaint about  the events  from 30 November 2018. He said that 
MORE TH>N had only paid him £60.00  towards the £190.00  invoice  and it should  pay him 
the balance of £130.00. He also said it should pay him an additional £100.00 for making him 
bring the complaint to us.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think it 
would be reasonable to tell MORE TH>N  to cover the cost of redecorating the wall. She 
thought that the offer of £300.00 was fair.
Mr D disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says,  in summary, that:
MORE TH>N breached its contract  with him by failing to send a plumber to a home  
emergency.
Ref: DRN05591792By suggesting the services of the plumber, MORE TH>N became liable for the 
plumbers work.
MORE TH>N acknowledged, in its email  of the 18 December 2018, that it failed to 
inform him of its lack of affiliation with the plumber.
He is out of pocket  as a result of MORE TH>Ns breach.
Where a party is in breach of a contract, that party becomes liable for any loss the 
other party then suffers which  flows from that breach.  Consequently  MORE TH>N is 
liable for the damage  to his bathroom.
MORE TH>N escaped the plumbers  invoice. Therefore, it would be fair for it to pay 
the minimal amount which is outstanding for the damage caused as a result of its 
breach of contract.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D contacted the helpline around  lunchtime on 10 November 2018. But no visit was 
arranged and Mr D couldnt get through to the helpline on Sunday  11 November 2018.
After contacting the helpline on Monday  12 November 2018 Mr D was expecting  a plumber 
to visit on Thursday 15 November 2018.  But on the evening  of Wednesday 14 November 
2018, the helpline said a plumber would visit on Friday 16 November  2018.  That wasnt  
convenient for Mr D and he complained.
On 30 November 2018, MORE TH>Ns complaints  team contacted  Mr D. Rather than 
sending a plumber,  MORE  TH>N  offered to reimburse Mr D if he found a plumber. It emailed  
links to three websites. From one of them, Mr D contacted the plumber who visited on 10 
December 2018.  
I find that the plumber  accepted responsibility for causing the mess in the bathroom and 
thats why he waived his charge of £140.00. That was a benefit  to MORE TH>N as it didnt  
have to reimburse Mr D for any such charge.
After some other  emails,  MORE  TH>N  sent an email dated  18 December 2018. It included  
the following:
We should  have made it clear that we are not affiliated with the tradespeople on 
these websites. They are independent companies  who offer their services via [] 
trade finding sites in the public domain. Im sorry to note that they have stained your 
paintwork but we are not responsible for the quality  of work carried out by an 
independent contractor.
The £240  compensation  you have  been  offered and sent to date is fair in view of the 
service received. However, although we arent responsible for the damage caused by 
[the plumber], I think we could have explained that you would be entering into a 
Ref: DRN05591793private agreement with them. Due to this Im going  to send you a further £60 
compensation.
Notwithstanding that response, I consider that Mr D mustve realised all along that MORE 
TH>N wasnt  recommending  each  plumber on all the websites  and that he would  be entering 
into a private agreement with the plumber he chose.
I accept that Mr D wouldnt  have  found  himself in that situation if MORE TH>N had sent a 
plumber in mid-November 2018. However, I dont consider that it was a natural or 
reasonably foreseeable consequence that Mr D would end up with a plumber who 
accidentally caused  damage.
For that reason  I dont  find it fair and reasonable to hold MORE TH>N  responsible  for the 
damage to the bathroom or for the £190.00  cost of re-painting  it.
Mr D had already received £100.00  from the helpline company. MORE TH>N had intended 
to send a further  £140.00  but increased this by £60.00  and sent him £200.00. So in total he 
received £300.00.    
Overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct MORE  TH>N  to pay any more to Mr D or  
Mr J or to do any more in response to this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc (trading as MORE TH>N) to do anything further in 
response to this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D and Mr J to 
accept or reject my decision  before  6 May 2020.
