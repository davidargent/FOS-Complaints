The complaint
Miss D says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss D says that Sunny failed to carry out the appropriate affordability checks 
before lending to her, because if it had done it wouldnt have lent to her.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ds complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given as Miss Ds borrowing suggested she was having 
problems managing her money and that by loan 11 she was becoming persistently reliant on 
this type of lending. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to pay redress for loan 15 onwards. We told Miss D about the 
offer, but she didnt accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decided in my role as 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
 
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss D didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss D had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part, and Ill explain why.
I note there was a gap in the lending of three months after loan four was paid off. This was a 
relatively short break and Miss D had only been borrowing from Sunny for three months prior 
to that break so Ive borne this in mind when considering this complaint and what 
proportionate checks I think Sunny should have carried out at any given time during the 
borrowing relationship. 
And I think by loan six  and taking account of the three-month break  Sunny should have 
been looking to build a bigger picture of Miss Ds financial circumstances. This was the 
second loan Miss D had taken in just over a week, and for the same amount as the previous 
loan which was still outstanding. If Sunny had carried out additional checks, it would have 
seen that Miss D was having problems managing her money. Miss D was regularly using on-
line gambling websites. She was also borrowing from other short-term credit providers which 
would suggest that Miss D was juggling her finances in order to make ends meet. 
 All of Miss Ds loans were to be repaid over six months but I see that she regularly repaid 
her loans early  well before the term agreed at the outset  and sometimes only days after 
a loan was taken. I do appreciate this would have saved Miss D interest costs, but I would 
question why someone would repay a loan days after it was taken only to return shortly 
afterwards for further lending. As an example, loans one to three were all repaid on 15 
March 2016, but Miss D returned two weeks later for further borrowing at loan four and for 
the same amount as the total of the previous three loans  £400. This would suggest that 
Miss D was struggling to manage her finances effectively.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss D, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ds case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan 11. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss D was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss D had taken out 11 loans within eight months including the 
three-month break. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not that 
Miss D was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Miss D continued to be regularly provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. As an example, loans 11 and 12  totalling £200  were 
repaid early on 26 November 2016 and loan 13 was taken three days later on 29 
November 2016 and for the larger sum of £400. I think this makes it clear that the 
borrowing was unsustainable for Miss D and she was becoming persistently reliant 
on this type of lending.
 
Miss Ds last loan was taken out 27 months after her first loan. Miss D had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service what started out as short-term lending over 
an extended period.
 
I think that Miss D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ds ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans six to 24 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss D paid on loans six to 24; 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
remove any negative information about loans six to ten from Miss Ds credit file;
 
the number of loans taken from loan 11 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 11 to 24 should be removed from 
Miss Ds credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ds complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 July 2020.
