The complaint
Mr E, on behalf of E, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked a 
payment and didnt tell him it had done so. Mr E also complains about the time spent trying 
to sort matters out.
What happened
Mr E says he tried to pay £30,000 from Es account into his pension providers account on 6 
April 2020. He says he wished to take advantage of the depressed stock market but found 
out some days later that the payment had been blocked by NatWest. Mr E says he then 
spent some hours trying to sort matters out and eventually the money was paid about 11 
days late which meant he lost about £2,000 to £3,000 as the stock market had recovered. 
He says he was unable to make the complaint using NatWests online systems and didnt 
receive any contact from it about what took place and says the compensation it has offered 
isnt enough. He would like NatWest to pay for the investment loss.
NatWest says it acted in line with the account terms and conditions by blocking the 
transaction where it had security concerns. It says it has paid £150 compensation for the 
length of time Mr E spent trying to speak to it and for the service issues but says its not 
responsible for any lost investment. NatWest says it sent Mr E an e-mail on 7 April about the 
block but couldnt contact him by telephone as the number had recently been updated.
Me E brought the complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest was entitled in line 
with account terms and conditions to block a payment in these circumstances and did send 
Mr E an e-mail on 7 April 2020. He thought it reasonable to have expected Mr E to have 
checked the transaction and thought the compensation appropriate for that part of the 
complaint. The investigator didnt think NatWest was liable for the investment loss.
Mr E doesnt accept that view and in summary says he didnt receive the e-mail and 
questions why the transaction was blocked as he made a similar payment some days before 
and used NatWests card reader and correct details.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint and I dont require it to compensate Mr E for any investment loss he suffered for 
the reasons I will explain.
This is a complaint by E and not Mr E as the payment that was blocked was from Es 
account. That means I can only consider any impact NatWests actions may have had on E 
and not Mr E. And as its Mr E that says he suffered an investment loss that is not something 
I can consider even if I thought NatWest had acted unfairly.
Im satisfied that Es account conditions make clear that NatWest may block a transaction or 
suspend account access if it reasonably considers there may be fraudulent activity. I think 
that is what took place here having looked at NatWests records, that for whatever reason its 
security systems flagged up the attempted payment. I appreciate that this was a legitimate 
payment and I accept in those circumstances genuine customers are caused inconvenience 
and often frustration. But Im sure Mr E appreciates that fraud is a major problem for banks 
and building societies and that they have a duty to protect its customers money. I also dont 
think it matters that Mr E used a card reader and correct details to authorise the payment or 
that NatWest is under a duty to provide the exact reasons why the transaction was blocked.
I dont think NatWest made a mistake or acted unfairly by concluding it didnt wish to contact 
Mr E by telephone as the number had only recently been updated and that it reasonably 
concluded that was in its self a security concern. NatWests records say that an e-mail was 
sent to Mr E on 7 April 2020 and I have no reason to doubt that was the case. But I 
appreciate Mr E says he didnt receive it and I have no reason to doubt what he says about 
that. I make clear to Mr E that I have not seen the e-mail but simply a record that it was sent, 
and I cant fairly hold NatWest responsible for an e-mail not being correctly delivered.
There is no question here that Mr E spent time trying to speak to NatWest and that it didnt 
deal with parts of the complaint as it should. I have made clear that I cant order NatWest to 
compensate Mr E as this is Es complaint but overall, Im satisfied NatWest has paid a fair 
and reasonable level of compensation for those other matters and I appreciate that they are 
not the main part of this complaint in any event.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest was entitled to block the transaction and, in any event, I 
find E has not suffered any financial loss.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 November 2020.
