The complaint
Mr J complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has dealt with two payments 
made through PayPal for his online business. He thinks PayPal has ignored the terms he 
applies to sales, and wants to know why it has withheld a payment.
What happened
Mr J said that he has a small online business, selling laptops. He said he sold one, which 
was working fine. But then the buyer downloaded a new operating system, and the sound 
stopped working. Mr J said that changing the software like this is against the terms that he 
applies to his sales, but he said that when the buyer returned the item, PayPal upheld the 
buyers complaint, and took back from Mr J the money the seller paid for the purchase. 
PayPal also charged Mr J a Â£12 dispute fee.
Mr J said that around the same time, a second payment to him was held by PayPal, so he 
couldnt access it. He said PayPal had promised to release it within seven days, but it didnt. 
Mr J thought this hold had been put in place so that PayPal could deduct a dispute fee from 
this money, although he said that PayPal had already told him it wouldnt do that. 
Mr J showed us the email exchanges between him and the buyer. Mr J said the emails from 
the buyer showed he was rude and abusive. And Mr J showed us that hed reported 
problems with the buyer objecting to the delivery time to PayPal. It said it wouldnt charge a 
dispute fee if the buyer raised a complaint about this.
PayPal said that it couldnt know what condition the laptop was in when it arrived, and it 
thought that the fairest thing to do was to refund the buyer, once the item was returned. 
PayPal also said it placed a hold on a subsequent payment for security reasons. It said it 
didnt give Mr J a timetable for this payment to be released. PayPal said it did this in line with 
its own terms, and it had since released the funds.
Our investigator thought this complaint shouldnt be upheld. He said that he was sorry to 
hear about the family difficulties that Mr J was experiencing. But he didnt think PayPal had 
done anything wrong. He said that PayPal had explained it couldnt tell what condition the 
laptop was in when it was sent or received, so it felt the fairest thing to do was to tell the 
buyer to send the item back, and provide him with a refund if he did so. And Mr J wasnt 
covered by seller protection, because that didnt cover this type of buyer claim. Our 
investigator thought that PayPal had acted fairly.
Our investigator also said that PayPal had put a hold on the payment to Mr J in line with its 
agreement. And he said PayPal hadnt promised Mr J it would release this within seven 
days. So he didnt think PayPal needed to do more than this. 
Our investigator knew Mr J had mentioned other problems since then, but he said Mr J 
would need to raise those with PayPal first. 
Mr J said that our investigator had missed a crucial point. He said that the buyer had 
admitted that the laptop arrived with a different operating system, and it was the buyer who 
decided to download and install an update to this system. Mr J said hed pointed this out to 
PayPal, and to us. 
Our investigator said that the buyer had emailed Mr J to say that hed paid extra for this new 
operating system to be installed, and the laptop had arrived without this installed. Our 
investigator said that meant that the item wasnt as described when it arrived.
Mr J said that the debt collector that PayPal had instructed hadnt been told about his 
dispute. And he said that if the item arrived without the required operating system, and the 
buyer took it on himself to install that system, damaging the item in the process, then would 
we still say that the key issue was that the item didnt arrive with the right operating system?
Our investigator said she was just looking at what PayPal did. And she still didnt think it had 
been unfair. 
Mr J said that this totally ignored the terms of his sale, which meant the buyer shouldve got 
in touch straight away if something was wrong, not tried to fix it himself. Mr J wanted an 
ombudsman to consider his complaint, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
PayPal offers both buyer protection and seller protection. These are both limited forms of 
transaction guarantee, and any claim under either is adjudicated by PayPal. People using 
PayPal agree to the terms of these guarantees, when they agree to the overall terms PayPal 
applies.
What I have to do, when someone complains about how PayPal has applied its terms, is 
look at those terms to see if PayPal has done what it said it would do. And I also have to 
think about whether what PayPal has done was unfair or unreasonable.
In this case, the buyer made a claim under buyer protection, which PayPal upheld.
Ive looked carefully at the correspondence between the buyer and the seller, which PayPal 
could also see. I can understand why Mr J felt that this buyer had been rude and abusive 
from the start. However, I can also see that the buyer states a number of times that hed paid 
extra to have a specific operating system installed on the laptop. And he said that this 
system wasnt fully installed. He didnt say that hed downloaded the software himself. He 
said that the software setup needed to be run. When it was run, the laptop malfunctioned.
Mr J doesnt appear to me to have responded to this part of the buyers complaint, in the 
exchange he had with PayPal. What he said to the buyer was that he shouldnt have 
attempted to fix any problem with the laptop by altering the software. But that doesnt appear 
to be quite what the buyer says he did.
I think that the claims made by the buyer and the response made by Mr J in this case did 
mean that it was reasonable for PayPal to decide that the item Mr J sold wasnt as he 
described it, when it was delivered. Thats because it looked like a software upgrade the buyer had paid for, wasnt fully installed when the laptop arrived. So I dont think it was 
unreasonable or unfair for PayPal to decide that this item wasnt as described, and to require 
Mr J to make a refund, as long as the item was returned to him. 
Mr J says thats not fair, because the buyer had agreed under the terms Mr J applies to all 
sales, not to try to fix the item himself. I understand why Mr J is concerned about this, but I 
still think that PayPal has done what it said it would do, in its terms, and that it hasnt been 
unreasonable.
Mr J said he was then charged a dispute fee. Im satisfied that this is also part of PayPals 
terms, and I dont think PayPals earlier commitment not to charge a dispute fee, was made 
in relation to this dispute.
Ive also checked PayPals seller protection, and I can see that, as PayPal said, this sort of 
claim by a buyer isnt covered under that scheme, so unfortunately Mr J isnt entitled to a 
refund from PayPals seller protection scheme.
Mr J also complained that PayPal withheld some money for a later transaction. PayPal has 
shown us that its permitted to do this under the terms Mr J agreed to. And, although PayPal 
hasnt explained why it held this money, I dont think its unreasonable, after a recent 
dispute, for PayPal to allow some time to make sure that Mr Js next sale went through fine. I 
understand that PayPal has now released these funds. And I havent been able to see that 
PayPal had promised Mr J that it would do so earlier than it did. So I dont think PayPal has 
to do any more about this. 
I know that Mr J will be disappointed, but I dont think that PayPal has done anything wrong 
here. So I dont think that this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2021.
