K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued last month. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold some of the complaint. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Mr M has said that 
he accepts my provisional decision.  QuickQuid has provided us with some comments. 
Although I am only summarising here what QuickQuid has said, I have considered its entire  
response carefully before writing this decision.
QuickQuid has said that loans 3 and 5 were given to Mr M after it had introduced  some  
enhanced affordability assessments. It also disagrees that I should conclude  the final loan 
shouldnt have been agreed based solely on the number of loans and length of Mr Ms 
borrowing relationship.  It says there is no guidance from the FCA to support that reasoning.  
And QuickQuid says that it doesnt consider Mr Ms borrowing history to show  a consistent 
pattern of borrowing  there were some  breaks in his lending of up to 31 days and the 
amount he borrowed  on loan 4 had reduced  considerably. QuickQuid considers that it should 
be necessary to examine Mr Ms specific financial circumstances at the time of loan 5 before 
deciding whether it was reasonable to agree  this loan.  QuickQuid  has also confirmed that it 
has recently waived  Mr Ms outstanding balance on the final loan.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service has explained to QuickQuid, on a number of occasions, how it will consider the 
enhanced affordability assessments that were undertaken following  regulation  by the FCA in 
2015. QuickQuid  is aware  that it should take account of past decisions in future complaint 
handling. So I see little merit in considering this point further save  to say that I have taken 
account of the checks that QuickQuid says it did before  lending  to Mr M, when considering  
whether these loans  should have been  agreed.  And having done so I dont think  that the 
information QuickQuid  gathered was sufficient to suggest Mr M could afford his repayments 
on the third loan.
When a consumer takes several loans over a long period of time, its most  likely that the 
loans arent  being used  for their intended purpose  of temporary  cash flow problems. As 
QuickQuid will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter to CEOs of high cost lending  
firms that a high volume of relending..may  be symptomatic  of unsustainable lending 
patterns. And I think that is the case here at the time of the fifth loan.
I dont think it necessary to forensically  examine  Mr Ms bank statements from that time. 
I think the very fact that Mr M used credit, that was specifically intended for short term use, 
over such  a prolonged period is in itself evidence of the problems  he was having  managing  
his money and the unsustainable nature of his borrowing.
Ref: DRN82376602So Im upholding  this complaint in relation to loans 3 and 5 (including the top up loans) and 
QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mr M loan 3 (on 11 September  2016) or 
loan 5 (on 26 November 2016) and the subsequent  top ups. So for each of those loans 
QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr M on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
QuickQuid has confirmed  that it has waived the outstanding balance  on Mr Ms final loan. 
I think that it is reasonable that QuickQuid should be entitled to offset any capital that it has 
waived as part of that balance against  the compensation  that is due to Mr M.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ms complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 August 2019.

complaint
Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an irresponsible 
manner.
background
Mr M was given five loans  by QuickQuid between March and November 2016. He topped up his final 
loan by taking some additional borrowing on three separate occasions. Mr M successfully repaid his 
first four loans, but a balance remains outstanding on his final loan. A summary of Mr Ms borrowing 
from QuickQuid is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing  Date Repayment DateLoan Amount  
(inc Top-Ups)
1 15/03/2016 09/06/2016 £ 200
2 28/06/2016 11/08/2016 £ 200
3 11/09/2016 07/10/2016 £ 550
4 14/10/2016 29/10/2016 £ 150
5 26/11/2016 - £ 400
Mr Ms complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think  QuickQuid had been 
wrong to give the majority  of the loans  to Mr M. But he thought that QuickQuid  should have realised 
that Mr M would be unlikely  to be able to repay loan 3 in a sustainable manner.  So he asked 
QuickQuid to pay Mr M some compensation in relation to that loan.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  it 
has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Mr M could repay the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
Ref: DRN82376604the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr M could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Before lending  to Mr M QuickQuid gathered information from him about  his income,  and his normal 
expenditure. QuickQuid used this information to estimate how much money  Mr M had left over each 
month that he could use to repay  his borrowing. Each time Mr M borrowed he told QuickQuid that he 
had £675 a month  left over.
The amounts that Mr M borrowed on his first two loans  were relatively  modest compared  to the 
income hed declared. And the repayments seemed to be affordable  based on what  hed told 
QuickQuid about his disposable income. So given  Mr Ws loan amounts, what  was apparent about his 
circumstances at the time, and his history with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve  been proportionate 
for QuickQuid  to ask him for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything in the information Mr M provided or the information  QuickQuid shouldve 
been aware  of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what he was saying.  
The third loan that QuickQuid gave to Mr M was significantly  bigger than the first two loans.  I think  
that escalation in borrowing alone should have put QuickQuid on notice that Mr M might be 
experiencing some financial  pressures. And the fact that he took this loan just a month after repaying  
his previous borrowing  might  have added to those concerns.
The highest  repayment that Mr M needed  to make on his third loan was just over £673  he needed  to 
make two much smaller  interest repayments  in the preceding month. When he asked for the loan Mr M 
told QuickQuid that he had a disposable income  of £675. But Mr M needed to make the largest  
repayment just over two months after taking the loan so QuickQuid  says he could save  some 
disposable income  in the first month to put towards his final repayment. So it is effectively saying that 
I should  consider the average repayment  Mr M needed to make  each month on his loan.
But I dont agree  that was reasonable here. Mr M had taken two loans  in relatively  quick succession  
beforehand. I dont think that should have given  QuickQuid any confidence  that Mr M was in a 
position to save money each month  or indeed  that what hes said about his disposable income 
was likely  to be entirely accurate. So I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to have  given this 
loan to Mr M.
Ref: DRN82376605Mr M repaid this loan early. And the next loan he asked to take was much smaller   it was a similar 
size to his first two loans. So here I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for QuickQuid to ask 
him for the amount of information that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable. 
I dont think QuickQuid  was wrong to give loan 4 to Mr M.
But looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending  history with Mr M I think by the time Mr M 
asked for loan 5 the lender should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Mr M asked for loan 5 hed been  borrowing from QuickQuid for a lengthy period 
and he wasnt making any inroads  to the amount he owed the lender.  By then Mr M had paid 
a considerable amount  of interest  to QuickQuid to effectively service a debt over an extended 
period.
Mr M asked to increase his borrowing on this loan on three  separate occasions in the 
following month.  I think that should have been a clear indication to QuickQuid that his 
finances were  not in a healthy state  and it was unlikely  this borrowing could be repaid in a 
sustainable manner.
I think  that Mr M lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing at the time of loan 5 and 
the subsequent top-ups  because:
this borrowing had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing  him to 
take expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the sheer amount  of borrowing was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability  
to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im intending to uphold  this complaint  in relation to loans 3 and 5 (including the top up loans) and 
QuickQuid should put things right.
