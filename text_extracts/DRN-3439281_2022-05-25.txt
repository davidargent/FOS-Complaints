The complaint
Mr M is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have not blocked transactions 
from certain retailer and the way in which it dealt with his concerns. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
When Mr M raised his concerns with NatWest it asked him whether he had an 
account with the retailer in question. Mr M confirmed that he did, and he had made 
some purchases. However, he was unhappy with how much hed been charged. 
NatWest initially offered to cancel Mr Ms debit card in response to the concerns he 
raised however Mr M did not wish for that to happen. As Mr M had confirmed he had 
an account with the retailer, NatWest asked him to raise his issues with the retailer 
directly so it could establish how the transactions were made.  And, once hed done 
that he was asked to let NatWest know so it could see if it could assist him further.  I 
dont think this was an unreasonable course of action for NatWest to advise based on 
the information available to me. As Mr M did not go back to NatWest it didnt need to 
take any further action. 
Throughout his correspondence, Mr M has mentioned his dissatisfaction with how the 
retailer operates. He has said he is unhappy he did not receive the free gift hed 
selected, instead hed received something that was not of use to him. Mr M has also 
said hes unhappy about the way the retailer advertises items for sale and that its 
pricing isnt clear in respect of item cost and postage and packaging in the emails it 
sends. I appreciate Mr Ms concerns here however these arent issues that fall under 
my remit to investigate, or do I think that NatWest should have automatically started 
the chargeback process the payments he is unhappy about because of the general 
concerns he has. NatWest is entitled to follow its processes before attempting a 
chargeback of the payment.
Mr M has said he was unhappy with the way he was spoken to by NatWests staff, he 
mentioned he felt his concerns were dismissed. NatWest said it was sorry Mr M felt 
this way and offered him Â£50 compensation to reflect the experience hed had. Ive 
considered this amount and I think it is fair and reasonable, so I wont be asking 
NatWest to increase it. I dont underestimate Mr Ms strength of feeling about the 
retailer concerned and that he felt his concerns werent taken on board. However, I 
dont think NatWest has acted incorrectly in how it dealt with the matter. It gave him 
details of the next steps to take and the opportunity to return to it once he had done 
so. 
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint against National Westminster Bank 
Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2022.
