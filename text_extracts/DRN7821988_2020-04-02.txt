Mr S says Gain  Credit LLC (trading as Lending  Stream) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 6 payday loans Gain Credit provided to Mr S between  January 2016 
and July 2018. Mr Ss borrowing history  with Gain Credit is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 14/01/2016 05/02/2016 6 £320.00 £143.36
2 29/05/2016 05/08/2016 6 £390.00 £174.72
3 17/06/2016 17/07/2016 6 £110.00 £222.24
break in chain
4 25/06/2018 27/06/2018 6 £300.00 £223.20
5 29/06/2018 17/07/2018 6 £500.00 £356.00
6 22/07/2018 28/12/2018 6 £750.00 £553.20
Mr S complained that Gain  Credit made poor checks for each loan and was given several 
loans in a short space of time which affected  his personal situation. He concludes that Gain  
Credit lent irresponsibly to him. He wants the loans refunded with interest, a payment for 
loss of earnings, compensation for his mental distress  and a letter  of apology.
Our adjudicator rejected  Mr Ss complaint.  Mr S disagreed with our adjudicators  view and 
asked for the matter  to be looked  at again. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Gain Credit needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
In Mr Ss case, I think there were two lending  chains because  I noted there  was around a 
two-year gap after loan 3 had been  paid and before loan 4 was taken out. So I would expect 
less thorough checks might have  been reasonable and proportionate in the early stages of 
each lending  chain.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Gain Credit should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN78219882the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. However, I dont think we reach  that point 
in Mr Ss case.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Gain Credit  was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Ive seen a record  of the information Mr S provided  when he completed his loan applications. 
For the first chain of lending, Mr Ss lowest declared income  monthly income was around 
£1,100.00 and his highest regular monthly  outgoings were around  £400. Mr S needed  to 
repay at most around £222.24 per month.  The highest repayment amount was reasonably  
low in proportion to Mr Ss declared  income  even at its lowest point. I have considered 
Mr Ss arguments, but they do not change  my mind. So I think all the loans in the first chain 
were probably affordable.
Ref: DRN78219883For the second chain of lending, his lowest declared monthly income was £1,609.  And his 
highest monthly outgoings were  around  £373.  Mr Ss highest  monthly  repayment  was 
around £553.20. Again, the highest repayment  amount  was reasonably  low in proportion to 
Mr Ss declared income  even at its lowest point. I have  considered  Mr Ss arguments, but 
they do not change my mind. So again  I think all the loans  in the second chain were 
probably affordable.
I havent seen  any further information  that shows its likely Gain  Credit was made aware of 
any financial  problems Mr S might  have been having; or anything  that would have prompted 
it to investigate Mr Ss circumstances further. So I think it was reasonable for Gain Credit  to 
rely on the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments  Gain  Credit  did for these loans 
were proportionate  particularly  with the two-year gap between  each chain  of loans. And I 
think its decisions to lend for loans 1 to 3 in the first chain and for loans 4 to 6 in the second 
chain were reasonable. Im not upholding  Mr Ss complaint about them.  
I note Mr S said he had taken out more loans recently. If he wishes to complain  about  the 
new loans, he will first have to make  the complaints to the business. If Mr S is not happy with 
the result, then he can refer his complaint about  the new loans  to this Service.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im not upholding Mr Ss complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2020.
