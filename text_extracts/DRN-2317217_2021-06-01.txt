The complaint
Mr R complains that he was mis-sold an Advantage Gold Account (AGA) in 2010 by National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions of the adjudicator for the following reasons.
NatWest says this was an information only sale, and that it didnt advise Mr R to take out the 
AGA or recommend it to him. Ive seen no evidence that it was an advised sale, so I think its 
more likely than not it wasnt. 
But even if NatWest had recommended the AGA to Mr R, I dont think I can say it was 
unsuitable for him as he had a car, and he travelled in the UK and Europe which meant he 
could use two of the main benefits of the product.
Mr R says he was particularly interested in the mobile phone insurance and that he was 
wrongly informed it would cover the phone provided to him by his employer and available to 
him for personal use.
But there is no evidence that he registered a phone after the sale, and an example of the 
information document he was most likely given shows clearly that a phone owned by an 
employer is not covered.
So, I dont think I can reasonably say it is more likely than not that he only took out the AGA 
for the mobile phone insurance or that he was misinformed about it.
So, I cant uphold Mr Rs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2021.
