The complaint
Ms S has complained that Ikano Bank AB (publ) (Ikano) rejected her claim against it under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in relation to her purchase of some solar panels.
What happened
Ms S bought solar panels for her home in September 2015. The purchase was funded by a 
five-year interest-free loan from Ikano, and that business is therefore liable for the acts and 
omissions of the installer under the relevant legislation. In this case, that relates to the 
installer misleading Ms S into believing that the panels would be self-funding after eight 
years, which they werent. She further complains that the panels did not live up to their 
predicted performance, and that it would actually take 27 years for the panels to pay for 
themselves.
Ms Ss complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. He did not uphold it. Based on 
the feed-in tariff (FIT) statements, he said that the panels were not under-performing. He 
said that the installer had provided paperwork which clearly stated that the panels would not 
pay for themselves until between 13 and 14 years had elapsed. Ms S did not accept that 
opinion, and so the case was referred for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I do not uphold this complaint. I will explain 
why.
Did the installer tell Ms S the panels would be self-funding after eight years?
I think that the installer made it clear at the point of sale that the panels would not be self-
funding. I think that for two reasons.
Firstly, in the document entitled Predicted System Performance there is a table on the 
second page which clearly sets out how well the panels were expected to perform each 
year, and what this would amount to in financial terms, over a period of 20 years. There is a 
gap in the rows between year 13 and year 14, in which the only text which appears is 
System Payback, in bold type. This is the point at which the panels were expected to yield 
a benefit exceeding the loan amount, which was £8,095. The running total benefit after 14 
years was £8,142.57.
Secondly, the contract for the sale of the solar panels sets out the cost and the estimated 
benefit of the panels very clearly, and the benefits did not begin to approach the cost.
Immediately above the signature box, in the middle, it says in bold capital letters Estimated 
total 1st year benefit, and next to that on the right is the figure £551.19. I think this figure is 
conspicuous; it is not buried in some fine print. To the left it says that the finance amount is 
£8,095, payable over five years. This document was signed by Ms S immediately below 
those figures, and so I think that the installers salesman did enough to bring this information 
to her attention.
One fifth of the amount borrowed would clearly come to a repayment figure of over £1,600 
each year. That is nearly three times the stated benefit figure for the first year. Again, I think 
this is clear.
For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the installer misled Ms S about the benefits and 
cost of the panels. It was clear that the panels would not be self-funding during the term of 
eight years.
Did the panels fail to perform as predicted?
The sales documentation states that the panels were predicted to produce 2,370 kWh each 
year. (Ikanos final response letter gives a lower figure, but I cannot see where this figure 
comes from, and I presume that it is an error.)
I have reviewed the FIT statements, and they state that the panels performed as follows 
during the first three years:
Period covered Running total in kWh Output that year
1 September 2015 to 1 September 2016 2,282.45 2,282.45
1 September 2016 to 1 September 2017 4,767.32 2,484.87
1 September 2017 to 5 September 2018 7,204.34 2,437.02
Average over 3 years: 7,204.34  3 2,401.45
That is almost exactly as predicted.
My final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
