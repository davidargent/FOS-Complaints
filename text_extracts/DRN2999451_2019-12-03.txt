Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Sunny  provided  to Mr G between June 2015 
and May 2016.  Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan number Amount

1 200 12.06.15 30.10.15 337.41
2 200 19.06.15 04.12.15 368.23
3 250 26.06.15 11.12.15 460.53
4 200 06.11.15 24.03.16 337.05
5 400 04.12.15 20.05.16 735.84

8 250 30.05.16 30.11.16 426.82
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN29994512refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
Mr G didnt disagree with the adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 5, so I dont think 
there is any ongoing dispute  about  these loans. As such, I wont be making a decision about  
this lending. But as the loans were  part of the borrowing  relationship that Mr G had with 
Sunny, I will take them  in to account when considering his other loans.
Loans 6 to 8
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G with a view to seeing if
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt
have given Mr G any more loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan
6.
Loan 6 was the sixth loan Mr G had taken out in about six months.  Each of loans were  
repayable in instalments.
Mr G took out loan 6 on the same day that hed repaid loan 3. And only the week  before, 
hed taken out loan 5 on the same day that hed repaid loan 2. 
Although the amounts Mr G was borrowing sometimes fluctuated, he often had more than 
one loan open at a time. In the first month of borrowing he took out three separate instalment 
loans, and loan 6 was the third loan hed taken  in about a month. 
So Mr G wasnt  making any real inroads  into what he owed Sunny and by loan 6 his 
indebtedness was being prolonged. Loan 6 was taken out about six months after his first. 
Ref: DRN29994513This meant that Mr G had been  paying  large  amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt 
to Sunny over this time.
I consider that Sunny  should have taken this as an indication  that Mr G had become reliant
on short  term lending. And that he was in all likelihood using short  term loans for everyday
living costs  rather than to help with unexpected expenses. And so there  was a clear  risk that 
Mr G wouldnt  be able to meet his repayments  for this loan or any subsequent loans in a 
sustainable manner.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
Mr G remained  indebted to Sunny for almost another year.  
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 8 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 6 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from Mr 
Gs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN29994514my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 January 2020.
