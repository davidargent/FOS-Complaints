The complaint
Miss S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) failed to remove a 
search from her credit file when instructed to do so by the credit provider.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision to both parties on 31 October 2023, which set out the 
background and my provisional findings on this complaint. My provisional decision said:
Miss S complained to a credit provider, which Ill call Company A. In resolution to her 
complaint, Company A agreed to remove two searches dated 22 December 2021 from her 
credit file.
Following this, Miss S noticed only one search had been removed from her credit file with 
TransUnion. After bringing a complaint to this service about Company A, Miss S was 
provided with evidence of its request to TransUnion regarding the removal of the searches.
Miss S says the request clearly refers to removal of all searches, so complained to 
TransUnion about its failure to action Company As request in full on 7 April 2022.
In its final response, TransUnion said it was only asked to remove one specific search entry 
and it had followed this instruction. It asked Miss S to let it know if she would like a dispute to 
be raised on the remaining search. Miss S responded to TransUnion, disputing that 
Company A had only asked to remove one search, and confirming she would be referring 
her complaint to this service.
Following referral to this service, TransUnion raised a dispute with Company A on 
24 April 2023.
Our investigator reviewed matters and concluded that TransUnion hadnt acted fairly. They 
said Company A asked for all searches made on 22 December 2021 be removed from 
Miss S credit file, not just one of them. As it hadnt done this, our investigator recommended 
that TransUnion remove the remaining search immediately and pay Miss S £250 for the 
distress and inconvenience caused by the delay.
Miss S accepted our investigators recommendation. TransUnion disagreed and maintained 
that it had acted on Company As instruction, which specified the search reference for the 
avoidance of doubt. And said it couldnt have removed the remaining search, which had a 
different reference, without confirmation from Company A. TransUnion also disagreed it was 
at fault for the delay in the second search being removed, as Miss S hadnt confirmed she 
wanted to raise a dispute following its offer to do this for her in its email of 8 April 2022 and 
final response of 20 May 2022. It also wasnt made aware Miss S had referred the complaint 
to this service until 13 January 2023, so believes it to be unreasonable to be held 
responsible for delays caused by this service. 
As no agreement has been reached, the matter has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think TransUnion acted fairly. Ill explain why.
Company A sent an email to TransUnion on 7 January 2022, which said:
Due to a complaint, would you please remove all record of credit search conducted on 
22/12/2021 under the following reference
{7DD52F31-0425-49F1-A99D-0A041F4C05B4}
Company A may have referred to all search records conducted on 22 December 2021, but 
Im satisfied the inclusion of the specific search reference removed any doubt about what 
TransUnion was being asked to do.
I dont agree the second search by Company A being on the same date is enough to say 
that TransUnion shouldve removed that too, based on the above request. I say this because 
there could have been circumstances that meant the second search shouldve remained on 
Miss S credit file, such as an erroneous duplicate search.
Based on the above, I think TransUnion did what it was asked to do by Company A, and 
therefore isnt at fault for the second search not being removed at the same time as the first.
That being said, within Miss S complaint to TransUnion, and her reply to its final response 
letter, Miss S made it clear both searches shouldve been removed. So, I think TransUnion 
was reasonably aware that Miss S disputed the second search remaining on her credit file. 
And its reasonable to expect TransUnion to have raised the dispute with Company A at this 
point.
I appreciate TransUnion made Miss S aware of the option to dispute the second search and 
asked her to provide further information before it could proceed to do so. However, Im 
satisfied TransUnion already held the information it needed to raise the dispute. I say this 
because the second search has since been removed from Miss S credit file on 3 May 2023, 
following a dispute raised by TransUnion on 24 April 2023. This was actioned after the 
complaint was referred to this service, and without the information it had asked Miss S to 
provide previously. So, I think its reasonable to conclude that this couldve been done 
without a specific request from Miss S and submission of the information requested back in 
April 2022.
Had this been done in April 2022, when Miss S raised her concerns with TransUnion, the 
search wouldve been removed a year earlier than it was.
As this service is not the regulator, I cannot fine or punish TransUnion. But I can consider 
the impact caused to Miss S and I do think TransUnions inaction caused her unnecessary 
inconvenience and frustration over a prolonged period of time in order to resolve the matter. 
So, I think its fair that TransUnion pay Miss S £250 compensation in recognition of this.
My provisional decision
For the reasons set out above, I intend to uphold Miss S complaint and require TransUnion 
International UK Limited to pay Miss S £250 compensation.
Responses to my provisional decisionBoth TransUnion and Miss S have confirmed their acceptance of my provisional decision 
and offered no further comments or submissions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As there are no further submissions for me to consider in relation to this matter, I see no 
reason to alter the conclusions reached in my provisional decision as set out above.
That is, I dont think TransUnion were at fault for not removing both searches dated 
22 December 2021 from Miss S credit file, as Company As request specified the reference 
of the search it was asking to be removed. But I think TransUnions inaction, when Miss S 
raised concerns about the remaining search on her credit file, caused unnecessary 
inconvenience and frustration. So, it should pay Miss S £250 to reflect that.
 
Putting things right
TransUnion should pay Miss S £250 compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I uphold Miss Ss complaint about 
TransUnion International UK Limited. I now require it to put things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 December 2023.
