Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  and thought  the loans  from May 2015 (loan 5) 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 247 Moneybox  disagreed and the complaint was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247 Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247 Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
Ref: DRN50058472the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to explain that 247 Moneybox was required to establish  
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
The adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 1 to 4 should be upheld, I agree with the 
adjudicator. Mr L hasnt provided  any further information disagreeing with the adjudication.  
As such,  I dont theres an ongoing dispute about  loans 1 to 4 and so Ive focussed my 
decision on loans 5 to 17.
247 Moneybox has said before  lending to Mr L, it searched his credit file. From loan 5 
onwards, 247 Moneybox asked Mr L about  his monthly income. I can also see that before 
247 Moneybox lent loans 5 onwards, it asked Mr L about his monthly living costs.
Mr Ls declared income varied  from around £2,400 to £2,600 and his monthly  expenses  
including things like housing, utility and travel varied from around £520  to £1,280 throughout 
the lending.
From the information provided, I can see that 247 Moneyboxs search into Mr Ls credit file at 
the time of loan 5 showed that he had a recent delinquent account and his worst payment 
status had increased  from his previous  loan.  I can also see that by the time of loan 5, the 
number of accounts Mr L hed recently opened and the number  of accounts he settled  had 
more than doubled from the time of loan 1. I think the number of settled accounts within a 
short space of time suggests that Mr L was likely borrowing short  term loans.
Also by loan 5, I think 247 Moneybox  shouldve been concerned that Mr L may have been 
struggling to manage  credit and that a pattern of dependence on these loans was beginning 
Ref: DRN50058473to emerge. I say this because Mr L was generally borrowing a new loan on the same day he 
repaid his previous loan and the loan amounts were generally increasing.
Given Mr Ls borrowing history and the information 247 Moneybox found from its search of 
Mr Ls credit  file. Taking these factors altogether, I dont think  247 Moneybox should have 
lent loans 5 and 6. So Im upholding the complaint about those loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247 Moneyboxs lending history with Mr L, to see if 
there was a point  at which 247 Moneybox  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so 247 Moneybox  should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point 247 Moneybox ought to have realised Mr L wasnt  managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr L had been  indebted to 247 Moneybox  for around eight 
months. So 247 Moneybox ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr L 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ls first loan was for £80 and loan 7 was for £500  more  than six times his first 
loan.  At this point  247 Moneybox  ought  to have known that Mr L was unlikely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr L was provided with a new loan within  days and in some  
instances on the same day as settling a previous one. 
I dont think Mr L wasnt making  any real inroads to the amount he owed 
247 Moneybox which  would have let him free himself from the need to borrow. Loan 
17 was taken out more than three years after Mr Ls first. And it was for a larger  
amount. Mr L had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 247 
Moneybox over an extended period.
247 Moneybox continued  to provide credit  from loan 7 onwards and I think  that Mr L lost out 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 7 onwards and 247 Moneybox should  put 
things right.
In response to the adjudication, 247 Moneybox has said that Mr Ls loans werent  increasing  
after loan 9. Ive carefully considered this and it hasnt  changed  my decision and Ill explain 
why. 
Ref: DRN50058474I can see that the loan amounts from loan 9 onwards generally varied from £400 to £700  
except loans 13 which was £251.  I accept that the loan amounts didnt continue to increase  
from loan 9 but the loans  werent  consistently  decreasing and even when Mr L reduced his 
borrowing to £251  at loan 13, he borrowed around  double that amount within  four days of 
repaying it. And most  of the other  loans remained roughly at a similar  level.  
Overall, I dont  think the fact that the loan amounts werent increasing in this case suggest  
that Mr L wasnt dependent on these  loans.
putting things right  what 247 Moneybox needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 5 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 to 6 from Mr Ls credit file;
the number  of loans taken from September  2015  (loan 7) onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 17 should  
be removed from Mr Ls credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 247 Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247 Moneybox must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Active  Securities 
Limited should pay Mr L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 December 2019
