K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA failed to close his PayPal credit
account.
background
Mr M had a PayPal bank account  with credit (the credit account) which he told us he was
using for his business. Mr M said he asked PayPal to close the credit account but several
months later it was still showing on his credit  file. So, in March 2019  Mr M complained to
PayPal. But they didnt respond  so he brought his complaint to us.
Mr M told us the failure to close this account  had an impact on both him and his business.
Our investigator spoke  with PayPal who initially had trouble finding the credit account.
This was because when  Mr M had complained,  hed given a different email address from the
one registered  to the credit account. The email  address hed used was registered to another
closed PayPal account (the closed account)  which didnt  have any credit.
Once PayPal  found  the credit account, they removed the active credit. But PayPal told us
Mr M needed to contact them directly from the appropriate email address or via telephone to
close the account completely. They said theyd tried unsuccessfully to contact Mr M on the
details they had for him. We passed this information on to Mr M.
Our investigator was of the view that PayPal  should have closed the credit  account when
Mr M asked  them to several months  before he complained. They  said that PayPal should
pay Mr M Â£100 compensation and remove any negative  information from his credit file
caused by the credit  account staying open.
PayPal disagreed, they said they had no record of a request to close  the credit account.
They said that Mr Ms complaint had come from an email address connected with a closed
account. So, they werent aware he was complaining  about  closure  of the credit account.
PayPal also said that because of general  data protection regulation (GDPR),  they couldnt
respond to an unregistered email  address.
PayPal told us they had no record of ever receiving any calls from Mr M about the credit
account. And noted they had a record of only two calls relating to the closed account - both
of which  were from July 2018 and related  to closing this account.  So, this case  has been
passed to me for a decision.
I asked Mr M for more  information about  his attempts to close  the credit  account. Mr M told
our investigator that hed called PayPal two or three times in September  or October 2018
and had been told his account was closed. He said he contacted  them when hed noticed
late payment markers had incorrectly been  put on the account.
I also asked Mr M for more information  about the impact of this issue on him. Mr M initially
told us that during this time he didnt  feel he could apply for a personal mortgage  because of
the impact on his credit file. He later told us he had in fact applied  for a mortgage  and been
rejected. We asked Mr M for evidence to support his account, for example, call records or
proof of the mortgage decline.  Mr M provided a credit report but no further evidence.
After reviewing the evidence, I felt it was likely Id reach a different decision than the
Ref: DRN40954372investigator. So, I shared my provisional findings  with PayPal and Mr M so both had the
opportunity to make any comments  or provide further evidence.  My provisional findings
were:
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive noted that although  Mr M has told us this account was for his business, the service
agreement between him and PayPal indicates this was a personal account  not a business
one. So, Im satisfied  I can look into his complaint about the impact of this issue  on him
personally.
I wont be commenting on his concerns  about  the impact  on his business  because this
complaint is being  dealt  with separately.
Mr M has told us he spoke with PayPal and asked them to close  the credit  account on
multiple occasions in September and October  2018.  But PayPal have told us they have  no
record of a request  to close this account. Where  the evidence is conflicting,  I need to decide
whats most likely  to have happened.
PayPals records show no calls in relation to the credit account  and only two calls in relation
to the closed account, both from July 2018. Mr M says the calls he made about closing the
credit account happened  several  months  later in September  or October. So, I dont think
these calls are relevant to his complaint.  And given this, PayPals call logs do seem  to
support their suggestion that Mr M didnt  contact them regarding the closure of the credit
account.
Weve asked Mr M for evidence  of his calls to PayPal but he hasnt provided this. And whilst
Mr M told us PayPal  put late payment markers  on his account, the credit file he provided
shows no late payment markers. Ive also noted a number of other  inconsistencies in what
Mr M has said  for example, he told our investigator both that he didnt apply for a mortgage
because of the issues with his credit  file, and that he applied and was rejected. And these
contradictions lead me to place less weight  on his evidence  overall.
Given this, and in the absence  of any evidence to support Mr Ms account,  I dont think its
likely Mr M did speak with PayPal about  closing his account in late 2018 as hes suggested.
Based on the evidence  available to me, the first time I think  PayPal were aware Mr M
wanted to close  the credit account was when  our service contacted them about Mr Ms
complaint. It was only at this point they were  able to match  Mr Ms complaint email with the
correct account  as our service provided further  information about Mr M. Whilst I appreciate
Mr M lodged  his complaint with PayPal first, he did so with the email address for the closed
account. And I dont  think its unreasonable that PayPal didnt respond  to this complaint
about closure, given  the account it was connected to was already closed.
I can also see that Mr M received an automated response from PayPal following his
complaint which  made it clear he needed to contact  them from the email  address registered
to his account. So, Im satisfied PayPal took appropriate steps  to make Mr M aware of this.
As an aside,  I note that Mr Ms account it still open. PayPal has made  it clear  that Mr M will
Ref: DRN40954373need to personally  call them, or email from the correct email  address, in order to pass
security and action his request. This does not seem  to me to be an unreasonable  security
measure and so I dont think theyve acted unfairly here either.  I would advise Mr M to do
this if he still wishes to close  this account.
response to my provisional  findings
PayPal had nothing  further to add. Mr M told us he didnt agree. He said hed contacted  
PayPal many times, both by phone and email. 
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I appreciate  Mr M is telling our service 
that he contacted  PayPal  on multiple occasions.  But he hasnt provided any new information  
or evidence.  And based on what Ive seen, I dont  think PayPal did anything wrong here.  So, 
whilst I appreciate it will come as a disappointment  to Mr M, Im not persuaded to change  my 
findings.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 July 2020.
