The complaint
Mr G complains about the way AvantCredit of UK, LLC has administered his fixed sum loan
account.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In 2017 Mr G took out a fixed sum loan with AvantCredit. The payments were about 
£280 a month. To avoid additional interest and adverse information being recorded 
with the credit reference agencies (CRAs) Mr G needed to make a payment each 
month for the term of the loan.
In June 2020 Mr G told AvantCredit his income had been impacted by the pandemic 
and asked for a payment holiday. AvantCredit agreed a three-month payment 
deferral. During this time Mr G didnt need to make a payment and his credit file 
wouldnt be impacted but interest would continue to accrue. AvantCredit explained 
the deferred payments would need to be addressed at the end of the deferral period.
In September 2020 AvantCredit wrote to Mr G to say his deferral period was coming 
to an end. It said the deferred payments (£834.09) and accrued interest (£279.52) 
would be moved to the end of the loan if it didnt hear from him and payments would 
restart. Mr G responded to say he could restart making his contractual payments but 
questioned why hed accrued interest. AvantCredit replied to say it had said interest 
would accrue during the deferral period. AvantCredit called Mr G a few times later in 
September 2020 but didnt get through to him.
In February 2021 Mr G complained to AvantCredit. He said it hadnt been taking his
payments by direct debit and had recorded missed payments with the CRAs. He was 
also unhappy he hadnt received a satisfactory answer about the accrued interest. 
Mr G and AvantCredit exchanged various correspondence and as I understand it, 
payments restarted on or around May 2021 with Mr G making higher than contractual 
payments to bring the account up to date. What remains in dispute, again as I 
understand it, is what Mr Gs credit file should show and what compensation, if any, 
AvantCredit should pay Mr G.
In my view there are faults on both sides when it comes to payments being missed 
from September 2020 onwards. On the one hand, AvantCredit ought reasonably to 
have taken payments using Mr Gs direct debit and if, as AvantCredit suggests, it 
didnt feel it could do so without Mr Gs clear consent, I think it could have done more 
to get said consent. On the other hand, Mr G knew payments werent being taken 
and appears to have done nothing about it until he realised the impact to his credit 
file. Then from February 2021 onwards communications between the two parties 
wasnt particularly productive as Mr G wanted his credit file amended and 
AvantCredit wanted to agree a solution to Mr Gs deferred payments and getting the 
account back on track.
Looking at things in the round, Im inclined to say AvantCredit should remove any 
missed payments it recorded with the CRAs between September 2020 and 
May 2021. This is because, in brief, Im satisfied these payments were missed as a 
result of various failings and misunderstanding, rather than a direct refusal or inability 
to make them on the part of Mr G. However, given Mr G has a part to play in this and 
overall, Im satisfied AvantCredit intended to support Mr G through initially a payment 
deferral and later through various payment options, I dont consider compensation 
appropriate.
Finally, and for completeness, Mr Gs loan balance is the subject of daily interest, as 
set out in the loan agreement. I havent been presented with compelling evidence or 
arguments to persuade me the interest AvantCredit has charged him, including 
during the deferral period, goes against the agreement, or is unfair in some other 
way.
Putting things right
I intend to require AvantCredit of UK, LLC to remove adverse information linked to 
the loan from September 2020 to May 2021 from Mr Gs credit file.
Mr G responded to my provisional decision to say (but not explain why) it was factually 
incorrect and set out his disappointment and difficult personal circumstances. AvantCredit 
didnt respond
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and in the absence of any further material comments/evidence, I see no 
reason to depart from my provisional decision.
Putting things right
I require AvantCredit of UK, LLC to remove adverse information linked to the loan from 
September 2020 to May 2021 from Mr Gs credit file.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put things right as set
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2022.
