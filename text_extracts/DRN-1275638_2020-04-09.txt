In response to Mr Ls complaint, Sunny offered to uphold the complaint from loan 15 
onwards. Mr L rejected this offer and brought his complaint to this service.
 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed. 
 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman.  
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 
 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
 
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
 
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
 
Mr L didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr L had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint. After doing so Im going to uphold 
Mr Ls complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
 
Like the adjudicator, I think that when Mr L returned for further borrowing at loan five, by this 
time Sunny should have been looking to build a more in-depth picture of his financial 
circumstances. And if it had done so, it would have seen that Mr L was having problems 
managing his finances. Sunny has told us it asked Mr L about other credit commitments he 
had, and this was recorded as none. But if Sunny had a fuller understanding of Mr Ls 
financial position it would have seen that when he took loan five, he was borrowing from five 
other short-term credit providers. As well as those other credit commitments, at loan five he 
still had two loans outstanding with Sunny. I think this clearly shows Mr L was having 
problems managing his money. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr L had taken out six loans in just over six months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ls 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ls first loan was for £200 and loan six was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mr L was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan six onwards Mr L was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. As examples, loan nine was taken the same day that loan 
eight was repaid and when loan nine was repaid, loan 11 was taken at the same 
time. One of Mr Ls complaint points was that he had to re-borrow and his quick 
uptake in re-borrowing once a loan was repaid would suggest this was likely.
Mr L was repaying some of his loans earlier than the agreed term of the loan. While 
this would have saved Mr L interest charges it can equally be the behaviour of 
someone juggling their finances which I think is most likely in this case.
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 38 was 
taken out nearly four and half years after Mr Ls first. Mr L had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 38 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Putting things right
If the outstanding balances due on the last three of Mr Ls loans has been transferred to a 
third party Sunny should buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loans back, then 
it needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved:  
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr L which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr L as though they had been repayments 
of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
 
If this results in Mr L having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
 
Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Mr L. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Mr L. 
 
E. Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation to loan five.
 
The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 38 should be removed from Mr Ls credit 
file. Sunny does not have to remove loans 36 to 38 from Mr Ls credit file until these have 
been repaid, but any adverse information recorded about these loans should still be 
removed.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
If after doing the above Mr L still has an outstanding balance due, then Sunny should try and 
work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Mr L in order to repay 
what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Mr L fairly. 
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ls complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 May 2020.
