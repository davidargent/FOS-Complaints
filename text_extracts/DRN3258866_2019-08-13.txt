K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  failed to send him a new 
debit card, which meant he couldnt  access funds in his current account.
background
Mr B lives overseas. His debit card was due to expire in August 2018 and he expected  a 
new one to be sent to him. When he contacted NatWest  in early August he was told it 
doesnt send value items such as debit cards to where he lives for security  reasons. It said 
Mr B could either collect a debit  card from any of its branches when  he was next in the UK. 
Or he could nominate someone  to collect the card on his behalf,  if he provided signed  
authorisation. 
Mr B continued to correspond with NatWest and made a complaint in September  2018 
because he hadnt  received a reply. NatWest accepted it hadnt dealt with his 
correspondence very well and apologised for the inconvenience caused. However, it noted 
that it had replied to Mr Bs question about  a replacement debit card within five calendar 
days of his contact  in August 2018. It repeated the advice it had provided in that response.
Mr B remained unhappy  and approached this service. He said NatWest  should either have  
sent the card directly  to him or via the UK-based  person  hed nominated in 2015 when he 
last needed a replacement card. Mr B said without  a valid debit  card he cant move money 
from the UK in the way he prefers,  using a foreign exchange intermediary. That means hes 
been unable  to get access  to his UK state pension and hes had to borrow  money.  He also 
said hes lost money  because the value  of the pound  has fallen since  he wanted to transfer  
money from his NatWest account.  He wanted  NatWest to send him a debit card and 
compensate him for the money hes lost. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint as he didnt think  NatWest had done anything  
wrong. He thought it had followed its policy in not sending a new card direct to Mr B. It had 
also made Mr B aware of this policy in 2015  and he didnt think it would have been 
reasonable for NatWest to send the card to the person hed previously nominated  in the UK 
without further  consent.  As Mr B doesnt agree with the investigators  view, the complaint 
has been referred to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  and for largely the same reasons.
Its NatWests  policy  not to send debit cards  to the country where Mr B lives.  This is for 
security reasons because  of losses its suffered  due to fraud. It recommends that high value 
items should only be despatched to customers in certain countries on an exceptional  basis.  
The policy has been in place for several years and NatWest  has followed its own guidance  in 
deciding not to send a replacement debit card direct  to Mr B. As such, I think thats fair.
NatWest explained  its policy  to Mr B a few days after he asked about obtaining a new card in 
August 2018.  It explained why it wouldnt send a new debit card in the post and advised  him 
of two ways of getting a new one, either by collecting it from a branch in the UK or 
nominating a person in the UK to collect it on his behalf. I dont think there  was any delay in 
Ref: DRN32588662NatWest providing Mr B with that information and I think those were reasonable alternatives  
to present.
I can also see that NatWest had provided  the same information in August  2015 when Mr B 
had previously asked  about not receiving a debit card.  Its not clear from the evidence  Ive 
seen how Mr B obtained a debit card on that occasion. He believes  NatWest sent it to him 
directly while  NatWest  cant find any evidence  of doing that. Had it sent the debit  card 
directly to Mr B by post that might  have caused Mr B some confusion and might  have  led 
him to believe it would happen  again.  But, whatever did happen  in 2015, Im satisfied that 
NatWest provided clear and consistent advice in 2018. 
Mr B has also said that NatWest should  have sent the replacement debit card to the person 
hed nominated in 2015.  But I agree with our investigator that it wouldnt be reasonable to 
expect NatWest to have done that without first seeking further consent from Mr B  three  
years had passed in the interim  and his relationship with that individual might  have changed. 
I note that NatWest have  now agreed  to make an exception in this case  and send a debit  
card direct to Mr B. However, I dont think its decision to do that undermines its previous 
decision not to do so. That decision was taken in accordance with its guidance, which also 
allowed it to exercise  its discretion in exceptional  circumstances.  
So, in summary,  I dont think NatWest has done  anything wrong.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 September  2019.
