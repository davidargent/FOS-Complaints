The complaint
Mr P complains about a default date recorded on his credit file by National Westminster 
Bank Plc. 
What happened
Mr P had a current account and associated overdraft with NatWest. In 2016 NatWest says 
Mr Ps account fell behind. In August 2016 a debt advice service contacted NatWest and 
made offers on Mr Ps outstanding balance. NatWest says it asked for further information 
from the debt advisors but didnt receive follow up responses. NatWest says it took the 
decision to close Mr Ps overdraft and record a default on his credit file in October 2016. 
In April 2019 NatWest sold the debt to another business Ill call R. And R went on to record a 
default date of July 2016 on Mr Ps credit file in relation to the debt it purchased from 
NatWest. 
Last year, Mr P complained to NatWest and said the default date shouldve been recorded 
as July 2016, not October 2016. NatWest sent two responses to Mr Ps complaint but didnt 
agree it had made a mistake or reported the incorrect default date. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ps complaint. They thought NatWest had 
correctly recorded the default date and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mr P asked to 
appeal, so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Unfortunately, NatWest has told us it only has limited information available from the time the 
account was closed at default. But NatWest has been able to supply its contact notes from 
Mr Ps account as well as statements going back to January 2016. So Ive been able to look 
at the transactions on Mr Ps old account as well as the contact made. 
The statements show Mr Ps account was still active with transactions to merchants being 
processed until 22 July 2016. So whilst I understand R went on to record a default date of 4 
July 2016 as the default date, Im satisfied the account was still active and subject to new 
payments and debits beyond that date. The information Ive seen doesnt show the account 
had been closed or a default balance finalised on 4 July 2016. 
The contact notes show that the debt advice service contacted NatWest on Mr Ps behalf in 
August 2016. And the statements show payments of around Â£12 a month were then sent by 
the debt advice service to NatWest but no formal arrangement had been agreed. NatWest 
says it took the decision to terminate the account and record a default in October 2016. 
Whilst I understand Mr Ps view that the default shouldve been dated July 2016, I havent 
found evidence to support that. 
R sent us details of the information it received from NatWest when it purchased the account 
and outstanding balance. The spreadsheet contains reference to a default date of 4 July 
2016. I can see the 6 October 2016 is noted as the date the account was referred to 
recoveries within the spreadsheet. I appreciate the information noted in Rs spreadsheet 
does indicate the earlier default date, but Im satisfied the other information available shows 
the account was active on 4 July 2016 and hadnt been closed or defaulted. Based on the 
available information, Im satisfied NatWest recorded the correct default date for Mr Ps 
current account. 
Mr Ps also raised concerns about partial settlement offers he later made to R. But the debt 
was sold by NatWest in April 2019. I havent seen any information that shows NatWest was 
involved in later settlement offers Mr P made to R. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr P but as Im satisfied NatWest dealt with his complaint fairly Im 
not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2023.
