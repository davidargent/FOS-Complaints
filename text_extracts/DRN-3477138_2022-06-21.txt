The complaint
Mr H and Mrs H complain about National Westminster Bank Plcs handling of their mortgage 
application.
What happened
In 2017 Mrs H took out a mortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) which 
was secured over a property she shared with Mr H. The mortgage was subject to an early 
repayment charge (ERC) if it was paid back before the fixed term interest rate product 
expired in November 2022.
In May 2021 Mrs H applied to port the mortgage to a new property and borrow an additional 
amount. NatWest gave Mrs H a decision in principle to lend £211,000. Mr H and Mrs H 
asked about adding Mr H to the mortgage. But their joint application was declined based on 
Mr Hs credit history and the conduct of his bank account. When Mrs H reapplied in her sole 
name, NatWest were only willing to lend around the amount of her existing mortgage, much 
less than the £211,000 in the original DIP. Mr H and Mrs H decided to redeem the NatWest 
mortgage and borrow elsewhere, incurring the ERC. 
Mr H and Mrs H were unhappy NatWest hadnt explained the mortgage application process 
to them and how long things would take. Mr H was concerned NatWest initially carried out a 
soft credit search against him. He said theyd breached data protection legislation by telling 
Mrs H the joint application was declined based on his financial position. And he was 
unhappy NatWest hadnt explained more fully why theyd declined the joint application.
NatWest apologised they hadnt managed Mr H and Mrs Hs expectations about the 
mortgage application process and for service issues. They paid Mr H and Mrs H £100 
compensation. They didnt uphold the remainder of Mr H and Mrs Hs complaint. Since Mr H 
and Mrs H were unhappy with that outcome, they brought their complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman. 
To put things right Mr H and Mrs H wanted NatWest to reimburse the ERC of around £3,180. 
And they wanted NatWest to remove the searches theyd carried out from their credit files. 
They said NatWests actions delayed completion of their purchase. That had meant they 
couldnt take advantage of the stamp duty holiday the government put in place during the 
coronavirus pandemic. And theyd had to pay around an additional £8,750 as a result. Mr H 
and Mrs H thought NatWest should pay that, plus additional compensation. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly and didnt uphold the complaint.    
Mr H and Mrs H didnt agree.  So, their complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont set out here everything the parties have told us. No discourtesy is intended by that  
its simply a reflection of the informal service we provide. But Id like to reassure the parties 
Ive carefully considered all the information theyve provided. 
I acknowledge Mr H and Mrs Hs strength of feeling about what happened. I can understand 
it was disappointing NatWest werent able to offer them the mortgage they wanted, and they 
didnt complete their purchase in time to take advantage of the stamp duty saving.
I agree NatWest should have explained to Mr H and Mrs H at the outset the process 
involved in making the mortgage application to manage their expectations about what would 
happen and the time it was likely to take. NatWest acknowledged that and the time it took for 
the joint application appointment to be arranged. And they paid Mr H and Mrs H 
compensation to reflect their poor service. Beyond that, I dont think NatWest have behaved 
unreasonably or treated Mr H and Mrs H unfairly, as Ill explain.
Mrs H first approached NatWest in mid-May 2021 after she and Mr H had seen a house they 
wanted to buy. NatWest issued a DIP to Mrs H before Mr H and Mrs H decided to go ahead 
with a joint mortgage application. Mr H and Mrs H knew by around 3 June their joint 
application had been declined. And Mrs H had a decision on her sole application the same 
day. Overall, I think the timescales were reasonable, although I can understand Mr H and 
Mrs H were unhappy with the outcome. 
NatWest, like other lenders, are obliged under Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules to 
consider whether the lending they offer is affordable for their customers. So, it was 
reasonable for them to go through a detailed mortgage application with Mr H and Mrs H that 
considered their financial situation. 
Lenders also have their own criteria for lending which will include a range of things such as 
borrowers credit history and the lenders risk appetite. Lenders are entitled to make 
commercial decisions about lending provided they treat their customers fairly. I think 
NatWest did here. They explained they declined the joint application on grounds of Mr Hs 
credit history and activity on his bank account. I understand Mr H would have liked a more 
detailed explanation than the one NatWest provided about that. But Im satisfied the 
information they gave was reasonable and went far enough. I wouldnt expect NatWest to 
provide, for example, commercially sensitive information about how they assess mortgage 
applications. From his discussions with NatWest, I think Mr H was aware of how he was 
managing his own account. And he and Mrs H can carry out their own checks with credit 
reference agencies if they want to know more. 
I acknowledge Mr Hs concern NatWest didnt initially explain all the reasons why the joint 
application had been declined. And he felt theyd breached data protection legislation by 
sharing information about his finances with Mrs H. I think it was fair for NatWest to let Mrs H 
know the broad reasons why the joint application was declined. Im not aware NatWest 
revealed personal data or detailed information about Mr Hs transactions that would give rise 
to a data breach. But if Mr H has continued concerns about that, he could ask the 
Information Commissioners Office to investigate. 
Mr H believes NatWest carried out a soft credit check against him when Mrs H was initially 
applying in her sole name and before the possibility of him joining the mortgage application 
was raised. It seems more likely the check was done once the possibility of him applying 
jointly with Mrs H was raised. Even if thats not the case, I dont think the check will have 
impacted Mr H significantly as a soft check is unlikely to have affected his credit position.
I understand it will have been disappointing when NatWest were only prepared to lend 
around the amount on Mrs Hs existing mortgage when she made the second application in 
her sole name. The original DIP wasnt a promise to lend and was subject to Mrs H going through a full application to check affordability in line with FCA requirements. NatWest 
explained theyd become aware of a loan she had which meant they thought the mortgage 
would be unaffordable. I dont think they treated Mrs H unfairly by declining her application 
on that basis.
Bearing everything in mind, I think NatWest have compensated Mr H and Mrs H fairly for the 
service failures they acknowledged. Beyond that, I dont think NatWest have acted 
unreasonably or treated Mr H and Mrs H unfairly.
Even if Id thought they had, I dont think it would have been fair to ask NatWest to reimburse 
the ERC. Even if the mortgage application had been accepted, theres no guarantee they 
would have been able to port the mortgage. The application may not have gone through 
later, for example, if an unfavourable valuation for the new property had come through. 
When the application was declined, Mr H and Mr H had a choice about moving their 
mortgage to another lender. They knew Mrs H would be liable to pay the ERC if they 
redeemed before the fixed interest rate period had expired. It was clearly set out in the terms 
and conditions of the NatWest mortgage. And they went ahead knowing that. 
I dont think it would have been fair either to ask NatWest to reimburse the stamp duty. 
House purchases can be delayed  or not complete at all - for many reasons. It would have 
been too speculative to say that an action on the part of NatWest led to Mr H and Mrs H 
missing the deadline for completion in time to benefit from the stamp duty holiday. 
NatWest were entitled to carry out credit checks when assessing Mr H and Mrs Hs 
mortgage applications to see if their lending criteria were met. I cant ask them to alter the 
records those checks created. 
Bearing everything in mind, whilst I understand Mr H and Mrs H will be disappointed, I think 
the £100 NatWest paid them for the poor service they acknowledged theyd provided was 
fair to put things right. So, I dont uphold their complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr H and Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 19 July 2022.
