The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wrongly removed a credit he received 
to his account.
What happened
Mr P sold an item using an online website in November 2019. The buyer paid him £670 
using PayPal as the payment service. The buyer subsequently said that the item was 
significantly not as described and raised a claim under PayPals Buyer Protection. 
PayPal accepted the buyers claim and agreed that the buyer would receive a refund once 
hed returned the item to Mr P and provided it with proof of delivery.
Mr P says PayPal removed the credit from his account on 3 December 2019. But, he says 
he didnt receive the item back from the buyer. He raised this matter with PayPal. It said it 
had a tracking number from Royal Mail which showed that the item had been returned to 
Mr P. Mr P phoned Royal Mail to check what had happened. He says it told him the 
tracking number related to a different address. Because of data protection rules Royal 
Mail said it couldnt provide him with the address that the item had been delivered to.
Mr P asked PayPal to reconsider its decision. It said it was unable to grant his appeal as 
he hadnt provided sufficient documentation to support what hed said.
Mr P wasnt satisfied. He referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked into 
his complaint. He said he could see that Mr P had been selling goods on this online 
website for over ten years. There was no negative feedback and over 400 reviews. He said 
hed looked at the evidence PayPal provided but it wasnt enough to show that the item 
had been delivered to Mr P. And, in light of Mr Ps dispute at the time, he thought PayPal 
shouldve done more to confirm the item had been correctly delivered before it removed 
the credit from Mr Ps account.
Our investigator thought PayPal should refund Mr Ps account with £670.
PayPal didnt agree. So, the complaint was passed to me to decide. I issued a provisional 
decision in which I said:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide 
whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When items are purchased using PayPal both the buyer and the seller have certain 
protections as set out in the User Agreement. The buyer, subject to certain 
conditions, is entitled to a refund where the goods supplied are significantly not as 
described. In this case the buyer said the item supplied to him was faulty. So, he 
made a claim under the Buyer Protection provisions in the User Agreement. His 
claim was accepted subject to him providing proof of delivery of the returned item.
PayPal says the buyer provided it with tracking information which satisfied it that 
the item had been delivered back to Mr P. It says it hasnt been able to provide us 
with full details because of the passage of time. The information it has provided 
includes a Royal Mail tracking reference, the date and time of delivery and the 
region where the item was delivered. The information doesnt include Mr Ps 
address or postcode. But, at the time, the tracking information provided by the 
buyer was sufficient to persuade PayPal that the item had been returned to Mr P. 
And, on that basis, it refunded the buyer.
Mr P is adamant that the item was not returned to him. He sent PayPal an email on 
8 December 2019 challenging its decision. He said hed called Royal Mail and it had 
told him the item referred to under the tracking number hadnt been sent to his 
address. He said Royal Mail couldnt provide this information in writing due to data 
protection. But, he said that Royal Mail could confirm this all to PayPal if it contacted 
Royal Mail.
In response PayPal said it hadnt changed its view that the documentation hed 
provided was insufficient.
Mr P subsequently sent another email to Royal Mail to try to get further 
documentation from it to support what hed said. He explained to Royal Mail that 
hed been given a tracking number by PayPal - but he hadnt received the item. He 
provided his address and said that the item hadnt been delivered to his address. 
He asked Royal Mail for an email or letter saying that the tracking number wasnt 
for an item delivered to his address.
Royal Mail replied by email on 29 December. It said Mr P had been misadvised by X 
[the online website where hed sold the item] and Royal Mail was unable to provide 
the information on letter headed paper as requested.
Mr P says this shows that Royal Mail was confirming that the item hadnt been 
delivered to him. But, I dont think it did confirm that. Royal Mail made no 
comment about what address the item was delivered to. It confirmed only that it 
couldnt provide the information hed requested on letter headed paper. Royal Mail 
also didnt say Mr P had been misadvised by PayPal  it referred only to him 
having been misadvised by the online website where hed sold the item.
Ive also noted that Mr P didnt provide PayPal with a copy of the email from 
Royal Mail dated 29 December 2019. So, it wasnt able to consider its 
contents or seek any further clarifications.
The User Agreement makes clear that PayPal makes the final decisions under 
the Buyer Protection provisions of its agreement. But it is still required to act 
fairly and reasonably  having regard to both the seller and the buyer.
Having considered everything here, my current view is that PayPal has acted fairly 
and reasonably. It had received the tracking receipt from the buyer which it 
examined and accepted at that time. And, although Mr P said he hadnt received 
the item, Im not persuaded he did enough to provide evidence to PayPal to support 
what hed said.
In these circumstances, I dont think it would be fair and reasonable to require 
PayPal to re-credit his account with the purchase monies. And, although I know it will come as a disappointment to Mr P, my current view is that I dont intend to 
require PayPal to do anything further to resolve this complaint.
My provisional decision
For the reasons given above, my provisional decision is that I do not intend to uphold 
this complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
PayPal didnt respond to my provisional decision.
Mr P did respond. He said he was disappointed with the provisional decision. Hed spent 
many hours trying to prove that he hadnt received the item. He thought hed done 
everything possible. Hed spoken to PayPal, Royal Mail, the website where hed sold the 
item and the police. But he said PayPal hadnt done anything to try to contact Royal Mail. He 
also said the Seller Protection he was entitled to under his agreement with PayPal had been 
ignored.
So, I now have to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered the responses to my provisional decision, I have not changed my view 
about how this complaint should be resolved. I know this will disappoint Mr P. So, Ill explain 
why.
In his response to the provisional decision, Mr P referred to the Seller Protection he says he 
was entitled to under the User Agreement. And, as I said in my provisional decision, both the 
buyer and the seller have protections under the User Agreement. Seller Protection applies in 
certain circumstances, as set out in the User Agreement. 
The User Agreement makes clear that if the seller loses a claim under the Buyer Protection 
provisions, the seller forfeits the full purchase price of the item. In this case the buyer raised 
a claim because he said the goods were significantly not as described. PayPal upheld that 
claim in favour of the buyer and refunded the purchase price to him subject to proof of 
delivery of the item back to Mr P. PayPal examined the tracking information the buyer 
provided and it was satisfied that the item had been delivered back to Mr P. In these 
circumstances, Mr P lost the claim that had been raised under the Buyer Protection 
provisions. That was why he wasnt able to rely on the Seller Protection provisions in the 
User Agreement.
I understand Mr P is adamant he didnt receive the item. But, in circumstances where PayPal 
was satisfied, based on the tracking information it had seen, that the item had been 
delivered back to him, it was up to Mr P to provide evidence to support what he said. 
It is the case that Mr P spent time trying to get information to support what hed said. He 
says Royal Mail told him that the tracking number supplied by PayPal wasnt for any item 
delivered to his address. But, he wasnt able to get Royal Mail to confirm that in writing. And, 
he hasnt explained why he didnt send PayPal a copy of the email he did receive from Royal 
Mail dated 29 December. As I said in my provisional decision, PayPal wasnt able to 
consider that email. Mr P also hasnt commented on the issue I raised about the content of 
the email from Royal Mail. So, I remain of the view that Mr P didnt do enough to provide 
evidence to PayPal to support what hed said. Having considered everything, for the reasons set out in my provisional decision, and in this 
final decision, I dont require PayPal to do anything further to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I do not uphold this complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2021.
