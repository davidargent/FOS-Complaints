K820x#14complaint
Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd failed to process  direct debit payments as requested. 
Miss H also complains that NewDay didnt call her as promised after she raised a complaint. 
 
background
Miss H has a credit card with NewDay  and on 21 June 2018 amended her direct  debit  
instruction online.  
On 2 July 2018 NewDay  received a message from Miss Hs bank with a request to cancel 
the direct  debit instruction. NewDay wrote to Miss H on 3 July 2018  to confirm the direct 
debit had been cancelled. 
Miss H called NewDay on 6 August 2018  and again  on 13 August 2018 and asked whether 
the direct  debit payment would be collected.  Miss H was told that the payment would be 
collected, but it wasnt. As a result, the outstanding balance incurred some interest. 
Miss H complained and was asked to be available for a call over the following days.  But 
NewDay didnt call her as agreed and she took the step of calling to discuss what  had 
happened. When Miss H spoke  with NewDay on 28 August 2018 it explained her complaint 
hadnt been allocated. But the call handler  looked at it while Miss H was on the phone  and 
arranged for £10.85 of interest  to be refunded. NewDay also paid Miss H £30 for the service  
shed received. 
As Miss H didnt feel NewDays offer was fair she referred her complaint to this service.  An 
adjudicator looked at what had happened but said they thought NewDay  had dealt with 
Miss Hs complaint fairly  so didnt ask it to do anything else.  
Miss H complained about the way her case had been handled by the adjudicator  and also 
asked for it to be appealed to an ombudsman. As a result,  the complaints been passed  to 
me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Before I give my decision on Miss Hs complaint I want to make clear that it only relates the 
issues shes raised concerning NewDay. I understand Miss H has complained about how the 
investigation was handled by the adjudicator and thats been  dealt  with separately.  Under 
this decision, Im only looking at NewDays actions. 
From what  Ive seen one of the key issues here is why the direct  debit  instruction  Miss H 
amended online on 21 June 2018 wasnt in place to collect a payment in August 2018.  
NewDay has provided some systems  evidence  to show it received a bacs message on 
2 July 2018 from Miss Hs bank  asking for the direct debit instruction to be cancelled. A bacs  
message is an electronic  message banks  can send to each other regarding payment 
arrangements for items like direct debits. I can see from Miss Hs communication  with the 
adjudicator that she doesnt recall cancelling the direct debit instruction, but the evidence  Ive 
Ref: DRN57044702seen is quite clear in showing that NewDay received a bacs message to that effect from her 
bank. 
NewDay went on to write  to Miss H on 3 July 2018 to tell her the direct debit had been 
cancelled. NewDays letter asked Miss H to ensure her payments were still made in time.  
Miss H doesnt appear to have received NewDays letter of 3 July 2018 but Ive seen a copy 
and can confirm its correctly addressed.  I dont know why it wasnt received but Im satisfied 
from what Ive seen  that NewDay did write to Miss H on 3 July 2018 having  received a 
request to cancel her direct debit instruction the day before. 
Based on what Ive seen  I havent  found any evidence that NewDay  made a mistake in 
regards to Miss Hs direct  debit instruction. 
Its unfortunate that the call recordings from 6 August 2018 and 13 August 2018 arent now 
available. But I dont  think thats harmed Miss Hs case  here. Miss H has told us she called 
to check her direct debit would be collected and was told on 13 August 2018 that it would be. 
NewDays told us that because the person Miss H spoke to looked  at whether a direct debit 
arranged on 21 June  2018 would be collected  in August 2018 and confirmed that it would 
be. But I think a more comprehensive  check wouldve been sufficient to show there wasnt  a 
direct debit instruction  in place. I agree that Miss H wasnt given clear information when she 
called. 
Miss H says that she was told to be available at a specific time when she complained but 
NewDay didnt then contact her as promised. NewDay says Miss H was asked to give a time 
shed be available  to discuss  the complaint. I think its more likely  than not that Miss H was 
told to be available  at a specific time and I can appreciate why shes  annoyed that she 
wasnt called  as advised. 
Miss H went on to call NewDay instead and someone looked  at her complaint while she was 
on the phone. As a result, NewDay refunded the additional interest  of £10.85  Miss H was 
charged and paid her £30. 
Ive carefully considered  everything Miss Hs told us about her complaint and the impact the 
issues have had on her. But as I havent  found NewDay made a mistake  when it cancelled 
the direct  debit instruction Miss H amended in June  2018, I dont think  it would be fair to tell it 
to pay compensation  for that issue. 
I agree  that there were  times when communication and service  were poor and I can see why 
Miss H is upset. But NewDay has refunded the additional interest that was applied  so Miss H 
hasnt lost out financially as a result  of whats happened.  And I think  the £30 NewDays paid 
fairly reflects the impact  of the way it handled Miss Hs calls in August 2018  and failing to call 
her as agreed after she complained. As Im satisfied what  NewDay  has paid is fair, Im not 
telling it to take any further action to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept or reject  my decision 
before 19 March 2019.
