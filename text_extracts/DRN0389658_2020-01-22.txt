K821x#15complaint
Mrs D says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about one flex credit  account  and 22 instalment loans Sunny provided to 
Mrs D between June 2014 and October 2017. Mrs Ds borrowing history is summarised at 
the end of this decision.  
Sunny upheld Mrs Ds complaint about  loan 1  the flex credit  account  and has paid the 
redress for this loan. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Ds complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed and offered to uphold Mrs Ds 
complaint about  loans  12 to 23. Mrs D didnt accept Sunnys offer, so the complaint was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN03896582I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mrs Ds complaint. Having done  so, Ive decided  to partially 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain  why. 
There was a significant break in Mrs Ds borrowing  from Sunny. There was a gap of around 
six months between loans 1 and 2. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view this gap 
as an indication that Mrs Ds finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances that 
had caused her to take out loan 1. So, I will look at Mrs Ds borrowing in two separate  
lending chains. 
The first chain was made up of loan 1, and the second chain was loans 2 to 23. Sunny has 
agreed to uphold loan 1 so I wont consider that any further but will take this loan into 
account when  considering  Mrs Ds complaint about the other loans. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  had done  anything wrong when  it lent Mrs D loans  2 to 5. 
As there has been no further dispute about  loans 1 to 5, Ive focussed my decision on the 
loans still in dispute. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 6 would most likely  have shown  
that Mrs D was borrowing  from other short-term lenders and high cost credit providers. This 
was increasing her monthly  outgoings.  In addition,  I think the fact Mrs D repaid her loans 
much earlier than planned should have  caused some concern to Sunny. As that might be the 
sort of behaviour  that would  indicate someone  was facing  problems  managing their money 
and needing  to refinance loans on a regular basis. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs D, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mrs Ds case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7 I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs D was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs D had taken  out 6 loans  within 6 months.  So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mrs D was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances  and that Mrs Ds 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN03896583From  loan 7 onwards  Mrs D was provided  with a new loan within  days of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mrs D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  23 was 
taken out nearly two and a half years after Mrs Ds first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Mrs D had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mrs D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ds indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ds ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 6 and loans 7 to 23 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs D paid on loans 6 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mrs Ds credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 to 23 should be removed from 
Mrs Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mrs D a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.
