The complaint
Miss G complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited didnt properly check whether a hire 
purchase agreement, under which it supplied a car to her, was affordable for her  and that it 
shouldnt have provided the credit to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Miss G under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that she electronically signed in October 2019  the price of the car was 
£18,273 and she agreed to make 48 monthly payments of £341.60 and a final 
payment of £6,791.85 (she also entered into a loan agreement with a third party to 
pay for paint and fabric protection  but that cant be considered as part of this 
complaint and is being dealt with separately);
she contacted the dealer and tried to cancel the agreement a week later and then 
complained to MotoNovo Finance because she said that the agreement was 
unaffordable for her and that it hadnt accepted a reduced payment from her;
Miss G wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service but our 
investigator thought that the checks carried out by MotoNovo Finance were sufficient, 
Miss G met its internal assessment criteria and demonstrated her ability to pay back 
the loan with the information that she provided to them  so she didnt think that 
MotoNovo Finance had been irresponsible in lending to her;
Miss G has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman  she says 
that she emailed and phoned the dealer and MotoNovo Finance to cancel the 
agreement, she was employed part-time, shes described her personal relationship 
with the dealer, and she says that the dealer provided incorrect information about her 
employment and income  she also says that her financial difficulties are getting 
worse;
a credit provider should make proportionate checks about the affordability of the 
credit before providing credit to a customer  but whats proportionate will depend on 
the circumstances of the credit;
the information that was provided to MotoNovo Finance showed that Miss G was 
employed full time with an annual income of £18,000 and it says that it carried out 
internal checks and made a credit check with a third party which didnt show any 
reason why it shouldnt provide credit to her;
I consider that it made proportionate checks about the affordability of the agreement 
for Miss G and that it was reasonable for it to conclude, on the basis of the 
information that it had gathered, that the monthly payments of £341.60 were 
affordable for her;
Miss G also electronically signed the hire purchase agreement which clearly set out 
the financial terms on which the car was being supplied to her and the pre-contract 
credit information in which she declared that she could afford the monthly payments 
and didnt know of any reason why that would change during the term of the 
agreement;
Miss G says that the dealer provided incorrect information about her employment and 
income but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it did so and 
I consider it to be more likely than not that Miss G either provided that information or 
knew what information the dealer was using;
she also says that she contacted the dealer to cancel the agreement seven days 
after signing it - but the copy of the e-mail that shes provided doesnt refer to the 
agreement being unaffordable and says that she wanted to reject the car because it 
wasnt as described;
the right to cancel the hire purchase agreement was clearly described in the 
agreement and it says: You must contact us either in writing or by telephone to notify 
us of your intention to withdraw from this Agreement  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Miss G contacted MotoNovo Finance to cancel the agreement until she 
complained to it nineteen days after shed signed the agreement  and by then her 
right to cancel the agreement had ended;
I sympathise with Miss G for the financial difficulties that shes described, but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement wasnt 
affordable for her at the time that it was taken out or that it was mis-sold to her  or 
that MotoNovo Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the agreement; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MotoNovo Finance to 
allow Miss G to reject the car and to end the agreement, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
I suggest that, if she hasnt already done so, Miss G contacts MotoNovo Finance about her 
financial difficulties and tries to agree an affordable repayment arrangement with it for the 
amount that she owes it under that agreement. Its required to respond to her financial 
difficulties positively and sympathetically. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Gs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 March 2021.
