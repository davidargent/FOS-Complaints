K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs E have  complained about their offset mortgage held with National Westminster 
Bank Plc. 
background
Mr and Mrs E have  an offset mortgage  with NatWest taken out in 2010.  The mortgage  has a 
linked current account, and the balance  in this account is offset  against  the mortgage  
balance. This means less interest is charged  on the mortgage balance,  but no interest  is 
paid on the balance held in the current account.  
The complaint arose  after Mr and Mrs E made  a £500 overpayment to their mortgage 
account on 24 May 2018. Despite this, the mortgage payment increased from £1,005 per 
month to £1,007  per month.  Mrs E, who has dealt with the complaint throughout, queried this 
and said she was given  conflicting information  by NatWest about  how interest was 
calculated and applied.
In July 2018 NatWest  arranged  for an expert in its mortgage team  to speak to Mrs E so he 
could clarify  how interest is calculated.  The information he provided on the phone was 
confirmed in a letter dated 4 July 2018.
Unhappy with NatWests  explanation, Mrs E complained to us. An investigator looked  at the 
complaint. He was satisfied with NatWests clarification of how interest is calculated and 
applied. He noted NatWest had paid £30 compensation for any confusion over the 
information Mrs E had received, which he thought was fair. But he didnt think NatWest had 
done anything  wrong in relation to the way it was applying interest to the mortgage or 
calculating the monthly  repayments.
Mr and Mrs E didnt  accept the investigators findings. They said hed accepted what  
NatWest said without  checking if its methodology is correct. The investigator clarified that we 
wouldnt carry out our own calculations, but would  consider any calculations  done by an 
actuary. He reiterated  that he didnt think NatWest had calculated  the repayments  outside of 
the mortgage conditions.
Because Mr and Mrs E didnt agree, the complaint has been passed  to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator, for largely the same reasons.
We provide an informal  service and its not part of our role to audit accounts or carry out 
actuarial calculations. I also cant tell NatWest what systems it should have in place or the 
way in which it calculates interest on its offset  mortgage accounts. What Im required to do is 
to review the complaint and decide  whether  NatWest has acted fairly and reasonably.
With this type of offset account, as I understand it, the direct  debit is calculated as if there is 
a zero balance in the linked account,  so the full amount is taken  each month. But once  the 
offset interest is applied,  then this reduces the amount of interest applied and thus increases 
Ref: DRN88928772the amount of capital repaid for that month. The amount  of offset  interest varies month by 
month, depending on the balance in the linked  current account. 
Ive read NatWests detailed explanation in its letter of 4 July 2018 about  how the monthly 
repayment is calculated  and the impact  on this of overpayments and the balance in the 
linked current account. Ive also looked at the mortgage terms and conditions. Having done  
so, Im satisfied NatWest is administering the account in accordance with the terms and 
conditions. 
Im also satisfied that NatWest has given  Mr and Mrs E a full explanation of the query they 
made after the May 2018 overpayment. I cant see that NatWest is required to do anything 
further or to calculate interest  differently.  I appreciate Mr and Mrs E still think  NatWests 
explanation is insufficient but I think the bank has set out its position clearly.
I see NatWest  paid compensation  of £30 for giving Mrs E confusing information  when  she 
queried the calculation of her repayments.  I think this is fair in all the circumstances and I 
dont require NatWest  to pay anything further.
Its always open to Mr and Mrs E, if they are still unhappy, to have the account  audited by 
their own expert. If they do so, and this reveals any new discrepancies,  then Mr and Mrs E 
will be able to complain to us about  this, if theyre  unable to resolve the matter with NatWest.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs E to 
accept or reject my decision  before  28 March  2019.
