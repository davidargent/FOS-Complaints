The complaint
Mr B, through his representative, complains that Morses Club PLC, lent to him when he 
could not afford it.
What happened
Morses has explained that as the earlier loans were almost a decade ago then it has no 
information over and above what appears in the loan table below. So, it has not been able to 
send us any information as to why they are labelled as starting from loan 6 and what 
information it gathered from Mr B in 2013 to 2016.
Using the information we have from Morses and some information from Mr Bs validation 
report then here is the table of what we know to have been approved loans. I have included 
the gaps in the lending relationship which does make a difference as to how we expected a 
lender to assess affordability.

Morses final response letter (FRL) does not uphold Mr Bs complaint. After Mr B had 
referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, one of our adjudicators looked 
at it all. He thought that for loans 6 to 10 he just did not have any information to make any 
assessment. And for loans 11 and 12 which he treated as a new chain of lending, the 
information from Morses showed that Mr B was able to afford the £15 and £20 a week 
repayment. So, our adjudicator did not uphold any part of the complaint.
Mr B was not content and said that he thinks he should be entitled to something. So, the 
unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high cost, short-term and home 
credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mr B could afford to pay back the amounts 
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks could have considered a number
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Bs 
income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish 
that any lending was sustainable for Mr B. These factors include:
Mr B having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be 
more difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr B having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr B coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr B. 
Morses was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether he technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr B was able to repay his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Bs complaint.
The two gaps in the lending chain were referred to by our adjudicator. A significant break 
during which a customer is not in debt to Morses for nine months or seven months, as Mr B 
was here, gives a clear indication that he was not reliant on the credit, that the reason for 
need the credit in the first place may have dissipated, and that he was not stuck in a cycle of 
debt. 
I have reviewed whether we have any other complaints for Mr B on our case management 
system, and we do not. I have looked to see if Mr B or his representative has sent to us any 
documents to establish his financial position for loans 6 to 10 but they have not. We have an 
explanation from Morses as to why it has no details about the loans 6 to 10 or anything prior to that. It has told us that due to data cleansing and the passage of time it has no other 
records. This is understandable and reasonable. 
And so, with no information about any of the loans 6 to 10 I can only decide on the limited 
information I have.
I can see that loans 6 to 10 were all repaid early. I see that the loans were relatively modest 
in amount and in term length. None of them overlapped and in the circumstances I have 
nothing to lead me to conclude either that Morses had lent irresponsibly or that Mr B could 
not afford them. I do not uphold the complaint about loans 6 to 10. 
For loans 11 and 12 we have a little more information. For loans early in the new lending 
chain, as I think that loan 11 is the first loan in a new loan chain, then Id expect 
proportionate checks to mean that Morses could rely on information it gathered from Mr B. 
Here it seems that Mr B informed Morses what his income and expenditure was on a weekly 
basis and I have duplicated here what Morses has sent to us:
LOAN INCOME EXPENDITURE DISPOSABLE 
INCOME
11 £900.00 £375.00 £525.00
12 £650.00 £265.00 £385.00
Morses information sheet says that Mr Bs expenditure was on a mortgage, childcare and 
groceries. So, I think its easy to see that on this information the repayment sum for loan 11 
at £15 a week was affordable. There was a gap of almost a month before Mr B took loan 12. 
And again, the figures tell me that Mr B was able to afford the £20 a week repayment sum. 
Plus, I have been provided with the repayment records and I do not see that Mr B was 
struggling to repay from those records. And it is reasonable for a lender to review the 
account history before lending again. Here, that account history looked positive. For all the 
above reasons I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.  Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or reject my decision before 
28 October 2022.
