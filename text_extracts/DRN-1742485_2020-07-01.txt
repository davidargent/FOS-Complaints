The complaint
Mr T complains about the service he received from Santander UK Plc when he tried to 
transfer money using telephone banking. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
When Mr T called Santander he wasnt able to give the security passcode. I wouldnt 
expect a business to complete a transfer without the account holder answering the 
security questions correctly. 
Mr T was told he could reset the passcode in branch or via online banking. So there 
were options available to him that wouldve allowed a transfer to be sent.
Ive listened to Mr Ts call with Santander on 15 January 2020. Im satisfied 
Santanders call handler gave Mr T the correct information about transfers and 
followed his instruction to close the account. Mr T didnt express and obvious 
dissatisfaction with the service he had received during his call. 
Im satisfied Santander dealt with Mr Ts complaint fairly, so Im not telling it to take 
any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
