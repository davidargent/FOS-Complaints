DRN-2080381
The complaint
Mr D complains that Yorkshire Building Society (trading as Chelsea Building Society) has 
reduced the interest rate on his savings accounts by more than the Bank of Englands base 
rate.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on summarising the reasons for my decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The Bank of England base rate was reduced to 0.1% on 19 March 2020 in an 
emergency move to help control the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Yorkshire Building Society subsequently reduced its rates in April 2020 to 0.5% and 
1.3% on Mr Ds respective savings accounts with them. Both of these rates are 
above the base rate of 0.1%.
 
In any event, the terms and conditions of Mr Ds accounts allow for Yorkshire 
Building Society to adjust interest rates in line with changes in the Bank of England 
base rate, so they have done nothing wrong by reducing their interest rates following 
the base rate reduction. This has also been applied across their savings accounts, so 
I cannot say that Mr D has been treated unfairly as all customers would have 
experienced a reduction in interest rates.
I appreciate this will come as disappointment to Mr D, but this is a commercial decision 
taken by Yorkshire building Society in response to the Bank of England base rate reduction 
and economic impact of the pandemic  which is action they are entitled to take in such 
circumstances.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2020.
