The complaint
Mr U complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC (AvantCredit) lent to him in an irresponsible
Manner.
What happened
Mr U was given 3 loans by AvantCredit. The details of these are as follows:
Number Date taken Amount Term Repayment
1 14/01/2017 £2000 24 months £112.89
2 11/08/2018 £2500 24 months £142.88
3 06/05/2019 £9500 36 months £420.35
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in February 2022. Both parties have 
received a copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from 
the decision below. I said;
Loans 1 and 2
Ive seen how AvantCredit asked about Mr Us financial circumstances when it agreed loans 
1 and 2. I can see from looking through the documentation it has supplied that it asked him 
basic questions about his income and some expenditure. It then says it verified Mr Us 
income and carried out a credit check on each occasion. But Im not satisfied that these 
checks went far enough on either occasion.
I dont think AvantCredit has been able to show that its checks were proportionate when it 
agreed to loan 1 or 2 when I consider the size of each loan, the term of 2 years and the 
amount payable on each occasion. In addition, the credit search results provided for both 
loans showed enough I think that it would have wanted to find out more and look to carry out 
a full review of Mr Us finances. In particular, Mr U had several payment arrangements for 
loans showing in the credit search results for loan 1. And AvantCredit ought to also have 
been concerned about the increase in overall unsecured debt showing in the search results 
provided for loan 2.
For the above reasons, I consider AvantCredits checks should have included a full review of 
Mr Us financial circumstances, including further verification of his expenditure so it could 
ensure that the loan repayments were affordable and sustainable when it considered Mr Us 
applications for loans 1 and 2.
I need to think about what AvantCredit would have seen if it had carried out proportionate 
checks. An investigator asked Mr U through his representatives, to provide his bank 
statements from around the time he applied for the loans. Im not suggesting here that this is 
the check that AvantCredit should have done on each occasion. But I think looking at his 
bank statements would give me the best picture of what the lender should have seen.
Mr U has not been able to provide our service with bank statements from before and around 
when he took out loans 1 and 2 though. So, I havent been able to see what AvantCredit 
would have most likely seen if it had carried out further checks. So, because of this, I am 
unable to safely conclude that Mr U was given loans that were unaffordable for him. 
Loans 3
I havent looked into whether AvantCredit carried out proportionate checks or not for loan 
3. This is because I am currently looking to uphold Mr Us complaint here anyway. I will 
explain why. 
I looked at the overall history and pattern of lending of these loans. By the time of Loan 3, 
AvantCredit ought reasonably to have realised it was increasing Mr Us indebtedness in a 
way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so it shouldnt have provided this 
loan. 
I say this because:
 By the time Mr U was asking for loan 3 he had been borrowing from AvantCredit for 
around 24 months with no significant breaks in between each loan;
Mr U had repaid loan 1 and then around 4 months later applied for loan 2. When he 
repaid loan 2 he then came back a month later and asked for loan 3;
Mr U wasnt making any inroads to the amounts he owed AvantCredit. The 
amounts he was asking for had increased from loan 1 to loan 3;
Mr U had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to AvantCredit 
over an extended period;
I think, the presence of these high cost loans on Mr Us credit file was likely to have had 
implications for Mr Us ability to access mainstream credit. I think on balance AvantCredit 
ought reasonably to have realised at this stage that Mr U was in a cycle of debt and had 
become reliant on it for providing credit and so was harmful for him. 
So, I am currently upholding this complaint about loan 3 and direct AvantCredit to put things 
right. For loans 1 and 2 I havent seen enough to conclude that AvantCredit did anything 
wrong.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. Mr U responded through his representatives and said he 
accepted the decision. AvantCredit did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr U has not made any further points and AvantCredit has not responded. So, as neither 
party has anything further to add, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings within 
my provisional decision. With that being the case, AvantCredit now needs to put things 
right. Putting things right
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr U to repay the principal amount that he borrowed for 
loan 3, because he has had the benefit of that lending. But he has been indebted with 
interest and charges on lending that shouldnt have been provided to him.
AvantCredit should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges on loan 3 and treat all the payments Mr U has 
made as payments towards the capital.
If reworking Mr Us loan account results in him having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then AvantCredit should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*.
Remove all entries relating to loan 3 on Mr Us credit file. At this point, any 
information about this loan was likely to be adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. AvantCredit 
should give Mr U a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Us complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK LLC to put 
things right as described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2022.
