Mr S complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to 
him.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks and it 
thought the first five loans were sustainable. It agreed that it shouldnt have approved Loans 
6 and 7. It agreed to refund the interest paid in respect of those loans and to remove any 
negative information in relation to them from Mr Ss credit record.
Mr S referred his complaint to us. Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She thought 
118 118 Money was wrong to have offered Loans 2 to 5 to Mr S. 
As 118 118 Money didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Ss complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr S would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr S wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Ss ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loan wouldnt cause Mr S undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr S. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.Loan 1
When he applied for the loan, Mr S told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £2,500 
and his expenses were £525. He was living with his parents. 118 118 Money carried out a 
credit search. There was nothing very concerning revealed by the credit search. Mr S had a 
total credit limit of £1,000.
I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan and 
the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Ss monthly income So I dont think 118 118 
Money ought to have been concerned the loan wouldnt be sustainably affordable for Mr S. It 
follows I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr S Loan 1. 
Loan 2
As 118 118 Money has accepted that it shouldnt have approved this loan, I dont need to 
consider it further.
Loan 3
When he applied for this loan, Mr S said his monthly income was £1,750 and he had 
outgoings of £350. 118 118 Money carried out a credit search. It calculated that hed have 
credit commitments of £741.10 and other regular outgoings of about £460. On those figures 
he would have had a disposable income of £341.10 after making the new loan repayment of 
£97.80 to 118 118 Money.
118 118 Moneys credit search showed that Mr S had taken out a loan of £20,000 three 
months previously and he owed a total of £22,300. I think 118 118 Money should have been 
concerned about his need to borrow so soon after taking out a very large loan. In addition his 
credit commitments with the Loan 3 repayments would be more than 50% of his monthly 
income. Due to these factors I think 118 118 Money should carried out further checks to 
assure itself that Mr S would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way over the 12 
month term. I think it ought to have carried out a more thorough review of Mr Ss finances. 
As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the checks carried out before providing 
this loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Ive looked at Mr Ss bank statements from around the time he applied for this loan. Im not 
suggesting here that these are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily have 
done. But I think looking at these would have given a good indication of the extent of Mr Ss 
financial situation at this time. These show that in the month before he took out Loan 3 his 
outgoings were about £2,000 more than money coming into his account and his credit 
commitments were more in the region of £900. So I dont think that 118 118 Money treated 
Mr S fairly when it agreed to make Loan 3 as it was likely that giving him more credit would 
simply add to his indebtedness.
Loan 4
Seven months later Mr S applied for another loan of £1,237.94 part of which was used to 
settle Loan 3. In his application Mr S said his monthly income was £2,300 but 118 118 
Money thought it was more likely to be around £1,840. 118 118 Money carried out a credit 
search. It calculated that hed have credit commitments of £741.10 and other regular 
outgoings of about £660. On those figures he would have had a disposable income of £342 
after making the new loan repayment of £96.90 to 118 118 Money.
Although 118 118 Money assessed the loan as affordable, I dont think the pounds and 
pence affordability showed the full picture here. 118 118 Moneys credit search showed that 
Mr Ss total borrowing had increased slightly since Loan 3. He was now over the limit on two 
credit card accounts and £1 under the limit on a third. I think 118 118 Money should have 
been concerned about the need for further borrowing within a short time of both Loan 3 and the large loan taken out 10 months previously. Mr Ss credit commitments with the Loan 4 
repayment would be about 45% of his monthly income. Because of this again I think 118 118 
Money should carried out further checks. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that 
the checks carried out before providing Mr S with this loan were reasonable and 
proportionate.
Looking at Mr Ss bank statements from the month before he applied for this loan, I can see 
that he was paying out over £800 in credit commitments and despite having a loan of £200 
paid in, one direct debit payment had been returned. I think if it had done further checks 118 
118 Money would have detected that he was borrowing to stay afloat and that providing 
more credit would make his situation worse rather than better.
Loan 5
Once more 118 118 Moneys calculations showed that on paper at least Mr S would have 
disposable income after making his new loan repayment. But 118 118 Money would have 
been aware from its credit search that the amount Mr S owed on all his credit commitments 
had sharply increased to over £38,000. Thats an increase of about £16,000 in 20 months. I 
think that should have rung some alarm bells for 118 118 Money and before lending for the 
fifth time, it should have carried out further checks.
Mr Ss bank statement for March 2017 shows that £353 was paid in and £3,017 was paid 
out. His financial situation had clearly deteriorated further. If 118 118 Money had carried out 
proportionate checks, I think it is more likely than not that it would have uncovered this and 
then not made the loan. So Im not persuaded that 118 118 Money acted fairly in lending to 
Mr S.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
As I have concluded 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Loans 2 to 5, it should:
  refund all interest, fees and charges applied to those loans;
pay interest* of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; and
remove any negative information about Loans 2 to 5 from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ss complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
