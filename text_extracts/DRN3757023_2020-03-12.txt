K820x#14complaint
Mr W says Barclays  Bank  UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold him a Tech pack from its feature 
store in 2012. Hes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ws complaint and didnt think the feature store pack  
had been mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ws complaint. 
Ive looked at everything thats been provided  on this complaint. And having done  so, I 
havent seen anything to suggest Mr W was mis-sold his Tech pack. 
I think that Mr W freely chose to take the Tech pack as I note that he had held a fee-free 
current account prior to the upgrade. And therefore,  I think  he wouldve known that fee free 
accounts were available to him. It seems from the notes made by Barclays at the time that 
Mr W agreed to add the pack as he was about  to buy a laptop and this account came  with 
Gadget cover. In addition, Mr W did register a phone on the same day as taking out the 
pack. So overall, I think he chose to agree to the tech pack  knowing he did not have to as he 
was interested  in the benefits that the pack came with.
I accept that Mr W may not have  been provided with all the information  about all of the 
benefits. But I havent seen anything to suggest clearer  information  wouldve changed his 
decision to agree to the pack.  And, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 April 2020.
