The complaint
Mr M complains that Ikano Bank AB (publ) wont reimburse him for the cost of removing the 
packaging after his kitchen was installed. His partner is also involved in his complaint. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about Ikano Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier and 
that Ikano Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
the kitchen suppliers terms and conditions say that removal of rubbish, waste or old 
appliances from the site isnt included;
Mr M says that he phoned the kitchen supplier when the kitchen was being installed 
and was told that it did remove the rubbish - but it didnt do so and hes paid Â£65 for it 
to be removed  so he claimed that amount from Ikano Bank under section 75 (hes 
also complained about other issues with the kitchen but this complaint is only about 
the removal of the packaging);
Mr Ms partner says that they have a call recording in which the kitchen supplier 
confirms its promise to remove the packaging - but the recording hasnt been 
provided to this service;
its clear from the kitchen suppliers terms and conditions that removal of packaging 
(and other waste) isnt included - so when the contract for the supply and installation 
of the kitchen and the loan agreement with Ikano Bank were entered into I dont 
consider that the services to be provided included the removal of packaging;
I consider that any later comment by the kitchen supplier about removal of the 
packaging didnt form part of the contract that Mr M entered into with it; 
Im not persuaded that the kitchen suppliers refusal to remove the packaging or to 
reimburse Mr M for the cost of doing so is enough to be a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Ikano Bank to reimburse Mr M for the amount that hes claimed, to pay him any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2020.
