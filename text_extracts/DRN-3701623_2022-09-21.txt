The complaint
A, who has power of attorney for Mr H, complains that NewDay Ltd didnt refund transactions 
he made when was A says Mr H was vulnerable and lacked capacity. 
What happened
A has a power of attorney for Mr H. A complains that NewDay allowed Mr H to make 
transactions at a time when he says Mr H lacked capacity and was vulnerable because of ill 
health. A says Mr H was the victim of a number of scams, and would like NewDay to refund 
£3,443.51.
Our investigator looked at this. Following the investigators involvement, NewDay agreed to 
write off the remaining debt. But the investigator didnt think NewDay needed to do more.
NewDay agreed. A didnt  A thinks NewDay should refund the remaining transactions.
I issued my provisional findings on this complaint on 17 August 2022. 
I said that Mr H would be liable for the transactions as long as hed authorised them. Some 
of the transactions on the account appeared to have been unauthorised  but Mr H reported 
these at the time, and had received a refund. 
With all this in mind, I thought it likely that Mr H agreed to the transactions he didnt question. 
Although I recognised what A had said about the conditions Mr H was living in, Mr H appears 
to have contacted NewDay on a number of occasions to discuss his account, including in 
September 2020 when he questioned a number of payments made from the account. 
NewDay didnt appear to have been aware that Mr H was particularly vulnerable until 
February 2021. 
Most of the transactions were relatively small in value, and took place over a considerable 
time. So I wasnt persuaded NewDay should have realised they were unusual or could have 
done more to protect Mr H.
I further noted that the transactions in question took place from 2016 onwards. And so while 
I accepted that, based on what A had said, that Mr H may have lacked capacity in February 
2021, this didnt mean hed have lacked capacity to make the earlier transactions. 
Meanwhile, the transactions Mr H made in August and September were refunded after Mr H 
contacted NewDay to question them. I thought the fact that Mr H was able to contact 
NewDay to discuss this suggested he might in fact have been able to manage his day to day 
finances  while the refunds also meant that the transactions closest in time to the point at 
which A discovered what had happened had already been refunded. Finally, I noted that 
NewDays offer to write off the outstanding balance included the value of the later 
transactions on the account.
With all this in mind, aside from telling NewDay to write off the remaining balance I wasnt 
minded to tell NewDay to do more.
I said Id consider any further comments by 14 September 2022.
NewDay has replied and agreed with my findings.
A has raised some further points:
A doesnt dispute that Mr H authorised the transactions in question. But A thinks 
NewDay could have done more to protect Mr H, especially as he says some of the 
transactions were well known scams.
A doesnt think its relevant that NewDay was unaware of Mr Hs circumstances until 
February 2021
A says that theres evidence that Mr H was living in these conditions from earlier  
and invites me to award a refund of the transactions from 2019 onwards
A doesnt see why the redress should be to write off the outstanding balance, given A 
personally made goodwill payments to keep the account going.
Ive therefore considered the complaint again.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Apart from the unauthorised transactions  that NewDay refunded at the time  theres no 
dispute that Mr H made the transactions in question. So the normal starting point would be 
that Mr H can be held liable for these: the Payment Services Regulations 2017, for instance, 
say that a payment transaction is to be regarded as having been authorised by the payer if 
he has consented to it.
I acknowledge what A has said about Mr Hs state of mind, and the evidence A has sent us 
about the conditions Mr H was living in. I have every sympathy for A and Mr H. But A 
accepts that Mr H authorised these transactions. Mr H likewise appears to have contacted 
NewDay to question unauthorised transactions on the account during this period. So it 
seems Mr H was able to monitor his spending on the account and that these were payments 
Mr H wanted to make.
And as Ive previously explained, the value of many of the later payments from the account 
have either been refunded or are included in the amount Mr H will no longer have to repay 
as the outstanding balance has been written off  this accounts for most of the spend from 
April 2020 onwards. The earlier payments are increasingly distant from the point at which A 
discovered what had happened to Mr H. Considering everything, Im not in a position to say 
Mr H lacked capacity to make these transactions or that he shouldnt therefore be treated as 
having authorised them for the purposes of the applicable regulations.
Ive also thought about whether NewDay could have done more to protect Mr H. But Im not 
persuaded it necessarily could. The transactions were relatively low in value  most were 
less than £30  and took place over a number of years  from 2016 to 2020. Given the 
period over which the transactions took place, Im not persuaded that the number or value of 
these transactions would necessarily have put NewDay on notice that something had gone 
wrong. So I dont find that NewDay should have blocked or asked further questions about 
these payments, or that Mr H has lost out as a result. And given Mr H was in touch with 
NewDay about unauthorised transactions, it seems likely hed have told NewDay, if questioned, that hed agreed to them. NewDay didnt know of Mr Hs situation until 2021, 
several months after the latest transaction on the account. Im not persuaded NewDay could 
have done more.
A has also questioned what Ive proposed NewDay do to put things right. NewDay had 
agreed to write off the outstanding balance  and says it will not pursue him for the 
remaining balance. I think that is fair in the circumstances of Mr Hs complaint.
I recognise that A is dissatisfied that he made payments towards the debt on Mr Hs behalf. 
But I have no power to compensate A. 
A also suggests the amount written off is arbitrary, as its based on what Mr H happened to 
owe. But given everything thats happened, Id expect NewDay to respond sympathetically to 
the situation Mr H found himself in  and thats what their decision to write off the 
outstanding balance has done. It removes the value of the later transactions from the 
account. Finally, writing off the balance avoids the need to carry out a detailed analysis of 
Mr Hs current ability to afford to repay the outstanding amount.
Putting things right
For the reasons above I reach the same conclusion as my provisional decision. NewDays 
offer to write off the outstanding balance is fair. To bring finality, Ill direct NewDay to do this 
in this decision.
My final decision
For the reasons above my final decision is that NewDay Ltds offer to write off the 
outstanding balance of the account is fair. I understand NewDay Ltd has already done this  
it now should do this if it hasnt already. I make no further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2022.
