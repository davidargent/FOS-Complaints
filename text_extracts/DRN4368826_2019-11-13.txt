This complaint is about ten instalment loans  Sunny  provided to Miss S between June 2015 
and May 2016.  The table  below contains some of the information  Sunny has provided about  
the lending.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Sunny disagreed  with the adjudicators  
opinion. It said there  was a long gap between the star of loan 1 and loan 4 and it didnt think  
the pattern  of lending itself showed that Miss S was having financial problems. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN43688262the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss S complaint. Ive decided  to uphold Miss S 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
After some correspondence, Miss S didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about 
loans 1 to 4. And Sunny agrees that it shouldnt have approved  loans 7 to 10. Because of 
this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement  about these loans. So I wont be making 
a decision about  this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship  Miss S had 
with Sunny. So they are something  I will take into account when  considering the other loans  
she took.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss S, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss S case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
up to loan 5 the amounts Miss S was borrowing had been  generally increasing. This 
was largely because Miss S was unable to repay  her earlier  loans fully before  taking  
out new borrowing. For example  loans 1 and 2 were still active  when loan 3 was 
started. And loans 3, 4 and 5 were all active at the same time. This pattern continued 
going forward
The amount  Miss S borrowed for loan 5 was a significant increase on the amounts  
that had gone before. She borrowed £500 for this loan. Loans  3 and 4 were  still 
outstanding making the total she had borrowed, and was still paying  for, to be near 
£1,000. And Miss S was in debt for all of this time, even though she didnt start all of 
the loans in a short period of time
And I have noted that whilst Sunny  didnt  make an offer of compensation in respect  
of loan 6 it did say to the adjudicator that the pattern of lending  was problematic and 
it ought to have made further enquires before lending  (as above it thinks  that it was 
wrong to lend from loan 7 in any event)
Ref: DRN43688263So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss S was having to 
borrow further to help with longer term financial problems and cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loans were leaving in her finances. It was likely that her 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny.  Loan 10 was 
taken out around 11 months after Miss S first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss S 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 
5 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Miss S ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans
Im upholding the complaint about loans  5 and 6 and I agree with the offer Sunny has made  
about loans 7 to 10 and so Sunny should put things right.
Sunny has agreed  that it was wrong  to lend any after loan 7. This is because  it thought  it 
was likely that Miss S had become reliant on credit at this point  and so it shouldnt have 
approved any further loans. This is an agreement of sorts but, put simply, in this case  I think 
this was evident at an earlier point as Ive detailed above. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loan 5 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 10 should be removed from 
Miss S credit file.
If Miss S still owes Sunny any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final three loans  
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.  Sunny  
should then re-work  the account as if all payments made by Miss S went  to towards  the 
principal. But importantly,  Sunny needs  to make sure that Miss S doesnt  repay  more  than 
the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Miss S hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed Sunny can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Miss S has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Miss S.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN43688264my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss S complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 December 2019.
