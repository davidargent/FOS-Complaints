The complaint
Mr G, who complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Aquacard, irresponsibly 
granted him a credit card account he couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
Mr G entered into an agreement with NewDay to have access to credit by way of a credit 
card account. The account was opened in October 2014 with a credit limit of £250. This 
increased to £650 in January 2015, to £1,550 in May 2015, to £2,550 in September 2015 
and then £3,800 in January 2016. NewDay has agreed to uphold Mr Gs complaint for the 
two final credit limit increases that were granted in August 2017 and February 2018, when 
the credit limits were increased to £5,100 and then £6,200. Mr G has already received a 
refund of account fees and interest. 
Mr G says NewDay didnt complete adequate affordability checks when it opened his 
account. He says if it had, it would have seen that the agreement wasnt affordable for him 
as he had already been using high levels of borrowing. 
NewDay said that it carried out reasonable and proportionate assessments to check Mr Gs 
financial circumstances before granting him the card account and each of the first four credit 
limit increases.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought NewDay didnt act 
unfairly or unreasonably by approving the account.
Mr G didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before opening the account, Ive seen that NewDay obtained details about Mr Gs income, 
his work and other information relating to his financial situation, including details about 
money hed owed elsewhere. Ive also seen that NewDays credit check showed no adverse 
information for the previous two years, although he had before then defaulted on two 
accounts. 
Ive reviewed the information and evidence NewDay gathered at the time of the account 
opening. Having done so Im satisfied that the checks that were completed on balance 
showed that the initial agreement was affordable to Mr G. I say this because at the time 
Mr G had a monthly income of around £1,600. And whilst he had a number of other credit 
accounts, the most recent credit checks suggested he owed only a relatively modest sum of 
£900 in unsecured debt. Mr G also didnt have any recent arrears or account defaults and 
had no County Court judgments. All of this suggests that given his financial situation at the 
time and the low opening credit limit of £250, and whilst it would have been proportionate to 
find out more about Mr Gs committed outgoings at the time, its likely that NewDay didnt act 
unfairly when approving his application.
Its possible that NewDay didnt carry out adequate checks before providing Mr G with the 
first four credit limit increases. But Ive seen that up until the fifth and sixth two increases  
for which NewDay has made an offer  each of the four credit limit increases on the account 
were largely well managed and Mr G was not using the full credit limit available to him. 
We also asked Mr G for some further details and evidence about his financial circumstances. 
This would have help us to understand what, if anything, NewDay might have found out if it 
completed reasonable and proportionate checks. However, Mr G hasnt provided sufficient 
information to help us determine whether or not NewDay made a fair lending decision about 
each of the four increases. As Im not able to say that NewDay acted unfairly, I dont think 
they need to do anything to put things right. 
So, in the absence of any extra evidence from Mr G to the contrary, I havent seen enough 
evidence to show that more thorough affordability checks would have led NewDay to think 
that the credit it provided to Mr G for the account opening and the first four credit limit 
increases were unreasonable. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2023.
