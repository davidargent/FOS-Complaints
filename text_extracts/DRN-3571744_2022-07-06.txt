The complaint
Mr F complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the currency they used to 
process a transaction he made, leading to an increased charge due to conversion rates.
What happened
Mr F held an account with PayPal. On 21 February 2022, Mr F added a new card to this 
account. This card was provided by a Bulgarian company. PayPal accepted this card and 
sent Mr F an e-mail on the same day, explaining they would use Bulgarian Lev (BGN) as the 
cards default currency when it was being used. But PayPal also explained within this e-mail 
that this currency could be changed.
Shortly after, on the same day, Mr F used his PayPal account and the newly added card to 
make a purchase with an online retailer. But this transaction was processed in BGN, which 
meant Mr F was charged an additional £1.12 due to the conversion charges. Mr F was 
unhappy about this, so he raised a complaint. 
Mr F didnt think PayPal were fair to set the currency of his card to BGN when he thought it 
wouldve been reasonably clear he intended for transactions to be processed in British 
Pounds (GBP). So, he thought PayPal should refund him the £1.12 hed been overcharged 
due to the currency conversion and be compensated for the inconvenience this situation 
caused.
PayPal responded and didnt agree. They thought they had acted fairly, and in line with the 
user agreement, when setting the cards currency to BGN and so, converting the payment 
and charging Mr F the costs associated with this. But as a gesture of goodwill, PayPal 
offered Mr F a £5 voucher that hed be able to use on any purchase made through them. Mr 
F was unhappy with this as he didnt intend to use his PayPal account again, meaning he 
wouldnt make use of the voucher. So, he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They recognised Mr Fs 
frustration with the additional charges and the comments he made relating to experiences 
hed had with other payment providers. But they didnt think PayPal had done anything 
wrong when setting the cards currency to match the country of the card provider. And they 
thought PayPal made Mr F reasonably aware this was the case and that this could be 
changed. So, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr F didnt agree. He explained he hadnt read the e-mail PayPal sent explaining the default 
currency of the card. And he didnt think this e-mail was clear. Mr F thought PayPal 
shouldve given him the option to select the currency when he made the transaction and he 
thought it was unfair that this didnt happen. Mr F maintained his belief PayPal had acted 
unfairly and that their business process should be amended so that the currency of a card is 
made clear when it is added, rather than after the fact in an email. As Mr F didnt agree, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as our 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr F. I dont doubt Mr Fs 
testimony that he assumed any transaction he made via PayPal using his new card would be 
processed in GBP. So, when he realised this hadnt happened and that hed been charged 
an additional £1.12 due to the conversion from BGN to GBP, I understand why hed be left 
frustrated and upset. And I can appreciate why Mr F would want this £1.12 to be refunded to 
him.
But for me to say this £1.12 should be refunded, and that PayPal should also compensate 
Mr F for the upset hes felt, Id first need to be satisfied PayPal did something wrong. So, I 
need to be satisfied that PayPal made a mistake, or acted unfairly, when setting the cards 
default currency to BGN. Or, that PayPal didnt make Mr F reasonably aware of this and 
make him aware he had the opportunity to change this before he made the transaction. And 
in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
exactly what Ive been able to consider, and how. I understand Mr F is unhappy with how 
PayPal have processed the payment, and he feels this is different to other payment 
providers hes used. But our service is unable to comment upon, or ask a business to 
change, a commercial process or system. So, Im unable to direct that PayPal should make 
a wholesale change to the way they process similar payments. And the role of our service is 
to investigate each complaint on its own merits, based on its own individual situation. So, 
Ive not been able to consider Mr Fs experiences with other payment providers when 
deciding this complaint.
Instead, my decision has focused solely on the actions of PayPal in Mr Fs specific situation, 
and whether I think these were fair. And Ive first thought about PayPals decision to list Mr 
Fs cards default currency as BGN.
PayPal have explained this was due to the card being provided by a Bulgarian company. 
And although I recognise Mr F resides in the United Kingdom, I dont think I can say PayPal 
have made a mistake, or acted unfairly, by defaulting the card currency to the national 
currency of the card provider as I think the card has a clear link to its provider.
But I would expect PayPal to make Mr F reasonably aware of this, and the options available 
to him if he wanted the currency to be changed.
I can see on the same day that Mr F added the card to his account, PayPal sent Mr F an e-
mail at around 10.51pm, which explained that PayPal would apply BGN when this card is 
being used before going on to explain Note that a cards currency can be changed a limited 
number of times each month. I think this e-mail shows PayPal making a reasonable attempt 
to notify Mr F of the card currency. Although I appreciate Mr F doesnt think this e-mail was 
clear, and that he wouldnt understand what BGN stands for, I think the e-mail makes it 
reasonably clear that the message relates to the currency associated to the card. And if Mr F 
had any concerns about this, I wouldve expected him to ask PayPal for clarification.Mr F has instead confirmed he didnt read this e-mail, as it was received as he was 
completing the transaction that incurred the additional charge. And he didnt think the subject 
line of the email made him reasonably aware the e-mail needed to be read. While I 
appreciate Mr Fs point, I dont think this means PayPal have acted unfairly here. Although I 
understand why Mr F may not have read this e-mail, I dont think PayPal would have any 
way of knowing this e-mail hadnt been read nor would I expect them to second guess this. 
So, from PayPals point of view, I think they were reasonable to assume Mr F was made 
aware he could change the currency associated to the card and, as he didnt and continued 
with a transaction, that he was happy for them to process the transaction using BGN.
And I have seen that the email was sent around 15 minutes before the transaction was 
completed. So, I think Mr F had the ability to read the email and change the currency before 
this transaction was made.
Ive also thought about Mr Fs comments about the information he was given before he 
completed the transaction himself. Mr F says it wasnt made clear that the transaction would 
be processed in BGN. And he says he wasnt given the chance to change this during the 
transaction itself. PayPal say Mr F wouldve been given this choice but are unable to provide 
any evidence to support this, as the transaction has already been completed.
So, both parties testimony disputes the other. And as I wasnt present at the time the 
transaction was completed, Im unable to say for certain what information was available to 
Mr F. And because of this, Im unable to say for certain that PayPal definitively made an 
error, or purposefully withheld important information.
What I am able to say for certain is that PayPal did email Mr F before the transaction was 
made explaining the cards default currency was set at BGN. And that PayPal explained Mr 
F was able to change this if he wished to do so. Although Mr F didnt read this e-mail, I can 
see he changed the currency on the card the following day so, I think its reasonable for me 
to assume Mr F had some understanding of how to do this.
So, based on the above, I dont think I have seen evidence that satisfies me PayPal made a 
mistake, or acted unfairly. And because of this, I dont think it would be fair for me to direct 
them to offer Mr F anything more than the £5 voucher I can see has been credited to his 
account. So, I dont think PayPal need to do anything more on this occasion.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2022.
