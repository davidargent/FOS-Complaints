The complaint
Mr J is unhappy with how esure Insurance Limited have settled a claim under his motor 
insurance policy.
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
My role is to look at what esure did to see if I think they acted fairly and reasonably 
when coming to a liability decision about the car accident. Any decision about liability 
is a matter for the courts.
After reviewing the evidence, it was the opinion of esure that there was no 
reasonable prospect of success if the matter went to court. So, they decided to settle 
the claim with full liability against Mr J. esure are allowed to make this decision under 
the policy terms.
Having carefully looked at what happened Im satisfied that esure fairly considered all 
the evidence when coming to the liability decision. This includes everything submitted 
by Mr J including photographs, medical information and his testimony.
esure made a decision as they were entitled to do under the policy, even if Mr J 
disagrees. Im happy that esure did this in a fair and reasonable way.
I understand the liability decision means Mr J has to pay an excess. However, Im satisfied 
esure considered all the information in a fair and reasonable way when coming to that 
decision.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 September 2020.
