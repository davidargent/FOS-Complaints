Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few loans with Sunny and seemed to be 
dependent on this type of loan. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Gs complaint from 
loan 17 onwards. The offer was put to Mr G, but he didnt accept it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Mr G 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making any 
findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr G and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Gs fourth loan in two months, I think Sunny 
should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Gs finances before lending him 
this loan. 
Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 4, its likely to have found 
that as well as having two loans still outstanding with itself, Mr G was borrowing from 
another short-term lender and the repayments for all these loans were increasing his 
monthly outgoings. And this was most likely an indication that he was in a cycle of debt and 
was further borrowing to cover the hole that repaying his previous loans was leaving in his 
finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 11. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out 11 loans in four months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Gs first loan was for £100 and loan 11 was for the same amount. By now, Sunny 
ought to have know that it was unlikely that Mr G was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 11 onwards Mr G was provided with a new loan within weeks  sometimes 
days - of taking out a previous one. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 23 
was taken out nine months after his first. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 11 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Gs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding Mr Gs complaint about loans 4 to 23 and Sunny should put things right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 10 from Mr Gs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 11 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 11 to 23 should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
