The complaint
Mr C complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA hasnt refunded him for a payment he 
didnt authorise.
What happened
Mr C cleared an outstanding balance on his PayPal credit account, and says he asked 
PayPal to close it. Two further retail transactions were taken, and Mr C contacted PayPal to 
dispute them.
PayPal offered to refund half the payments, but Mr C cleared the balance himself and asked 
to close the account. PayPal told Mr C hed have to wait to close, and he should call in.
Mr C contacted PayPal a few days later, when the payment was cleared and again asked to 
close the account. Mr C was told to call in to close the account, but it doesnt appear he did.
A short time later a payment for over £500 was taken, for a professional employment 
website. Mr C contacted PayPal again to complain. Mr C didnt think the payment should 
have left as his account should have closed and he said the payment was fraudulent.
PayPal responded to say there was nothing to indicate Mr C asked to close his account just 
after hed cleared the balance. The two payments to the same retailer were genuine and 
Mr C needed to pay this off to close the account.
PayPal also said the larger payment was taken via a billing agreement. PayPal had opened 
an investigation into the payment but thought it was authorised, so wouldnt refund it. And 
PayPal said it had reported accurate information to credit reference agencies.
Unhappy with this response, Mr C brought his complaint to this service. An investigator 
looked into things and thought Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. The investigator thought 
Mr C had made it clear he wanted to close the account.
And, the investigator thought the payment of over £500 hadnt been authorised by Mr C. The 
investigator thought PayPal should refund this payment, any associated interest and pay £50 
compensation to Mr C.
Mr C agreed with this, but PayPal didnt. PayPal said it hadnt made any errors and asked for 
an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As a general rule PayPal cant hold Mr C liable for payments where the evidence suggests 
he didnt authorise them.
Mr C paid the two retailer payments that debited his account, soon after hed brought the 
account to zero. It seems Mr C was willing to write off this loss to enable him to close the 
credit account, and PayPal hasnt carried out an investigation into these payments.
I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further with these two payments.
But, once Mr C had brought his credit account to zero a second time, its very clear he 
wanted to close this facility. Mr C sent several messages to say he wanted the credit 
account closed, but this wasnt done.
PayPal asked Mr C to call in to close the facility. Looking at the messages Mr C had sent 
PayPal, I think it was fairly clear he wanted nothing further to do with PayPal. In the 
circumstances, I think it would have been reasonable for PayPal to close the credit account.
But, it didnt, and in the specific circumstances I dont think it made a difference. Mr Cs 
PayPal account would likely have remained open. It seems Mr C was only looking to close 
off the credit facility.
If this had been done, any further payments would have debited a PayPal account where 
there was no credit facility. And Mr C would then likely have had the amount debited from his 
linked bank account.
However this payment would have been financed, Mr C maintains it wasnt an authorised 
payment. PayPal says it cant be unauthorised because it was set up as a billing agreement 
and had been paid previously.
Mr Cs explained he used the website in 2020 when looking for a job. PayPals shown Mr Cs 
account was debited for six months, from August 2020 to January 2021 inclusive. The 
monthly payments were less than £25.
Mr C was then debited over £500 in December 2021. The investigator has said theyd expect 
the website to take money closer to January 2021, and I agree. It seems the larger payment 
debited from Mr Cs PayPal account was for a yearly subscription.
If this payment was related to the six month subscription Mr C took in 2020, Id also expect 
the website to take an annual fee once the six month deal expired. 
By taking the payment in December 2021, it looks like Mr Cs paid for a yearly subscription in 
arrears  and I dont think this is very likely.
I also dont think its very likely Mr C took a six month subscription and allowed it to expire, 
waited several months then took a yearly subscription at the same time as he was cancelling 
the account linked to it, and then disputed the payment.
I think its more likely this payment is an error by the retailer, which means Mr C didnt 
authorise this specific payment.
PayPals said if a billing agreements in place the payment cant be unauthorised, but I dont 
think this is correct. Any error in a payment, like I thinks happened to Mr C, would potentially 
be unauthorised, regardless of whether a billing agreement is in place or not.
I dont think Mr C authorised the larger payment that debited in December 2021. And this is 
regardless of the fact hed paid the same retailer before. I cant be sure exactly what happened here, but Im satisfied the payment wasnt one Mr C agreed to make.
Mr C didnt pay the amount on the credit account, and PayPals added some further interest. 
PayPals also recorded adverse information on Mr Cs credit file. 
Since I dont think the large payment to the website was authorised by Mr C I dont think its 
fair for PayPal to apply interest or record missed payments on Mr Cs credit file.
And I can see Mr Cs been put to a fair amount of inconvenience, especially around some 
constant messages about the closure of his account. While I think most of the inconvenience 
has been caused by what appears to be an error by the website that charged Mr C, I also 
think PayPal should pay Mr C £50 to compensate for the inconvenience it caused.
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold Mr Cs complaint and PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should:
refund the payment to the website Mr Cs disputed
refund any associated interest on this payment
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file
pay Mr C £50 for the inconvenience
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 May 2023.
