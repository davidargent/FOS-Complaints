K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that his loans from CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, were 
unaffordable and shouldnt have been made to him  and he says that theyve caused him 
financial difficulty.
background
Mr D was given five loans  by QuickQuid between February 2016 and October  2017.  And he 
topped up three of those loans by taking  some additional borrowing shortly  after the initial 
loan. Most  of Mr Ds loans were repayable in two or three monthly  instalments. A summary  
of Mr Ds borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows:
loan number date taken amount borrowed maximum repayment 
amount
1 28 February 2016 £350 £431.20
2 2 October 2016 £950 £1,178
3 19 April 2017 £750 £924
3a 2 May 2017 £950 £1,178
4 28 July 2017 £500 £612
4a 3 August 2017 £600 £763
5 13 October 2017 £500 £620
5a 15 October 2017 £1,000 £1,240
Mr D increased  the amount he borrowed for loans 3, 4 and 5, so Ive labelled these top ups 
as a.
Mr D doesnt think QuickQuid carried out proper checks. If it had done so, he says it would  
have seen that he couldnt  afford to repay the loans  and that he became reliant on them to 
meet his normal expenses. Loan  5 remains  outstanding.
QuickQuid said it had performed affordability  checks by asking Mr D about his monthly  
income and expenditure. It also carried out a credit reference agency  checks  for each of the 
loans. Mr D was employed and it considered he had enough disposable income  to make the 
repayments when  they fell due without financial difficulties.
The adjudicator thought  the checks QuickQuid did for the first loan went far enough and its 
decision to lend was reasonable.  But he thought  QuickQuid shouldnt  have lent to Mr D from 
loan 2 onwards.  This is because he didnt think Mr D could afford the repayments to these 
loans. And this would  have  been clear if QuickQuid  had done better checks. So he asked 
QuickQuid to refund interest and charges for these loans, pay interest on those amounts and 
remove any adverse information  from his credit  file.
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator. It says that the loan was due to be repaid  over 
three months. And taking Mr Ds total disposable income over those months, compared with 
the total he had to repay, it says the loan was easily affordable  for him.
my provisional findings
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr D 
and to QuickQuid  on 31 October 2018. I summarise my findings:
Ref: DRN87227652QuickQuid was required  to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether 
Mr D could afford to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr D was borrowing and his lending  history, 
but there was no set list of checks QuickQuid had to do.
QuickQuid was required  to establish whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. 
Being  able to sustainably  meet the repayments  is defined  as being without undue  
difficulties, on time,  while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  further to meet the repayments. QuickQuid should realise, or it ought 
fairly and reasonably  to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
QuickQuid told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr D. It asked him for details 
of his income, and his normal expenditure, before  agreeing each loan. And it gathered 
information on Mr Ds circumstances from a credit reference agency.
Each of Mr Ds loans needed  to be repaid  over 3 months. But the capital wasnt 
repayable until the final month. This meant that Mr D only repaid interest at the start of 
the loan, and his final repayment  was much larger. QuickQuid says that this repayment  
arrangement allowed  Mr D to save money  each  month towards his final repayment.
I thought the checks QuickQuid  did for loan one were  proportionate and it wasnt wrong 
to conclude that the loan was affordable.
The amount  Mr D asked to borrow for his second loan with QuickQuid was a substantial 
amount of his income. I thought this should have  prompted QuickQuid to ask Mr D not 
only ask about  his normal living expenses, regular financial commitments  and any other 
short term lending but it should have taken  steps  to independently verify his true financial 
position before agreeing to lend,  perhaps  by asking him for evidence of him income and 
outgoings, such as payslips or copies of bills. Or it couldve looked at things like Mr Ds 
bank statements.
QuickQuid believed  it checks went far enough.  It said it independently  checked  Mr Ds 
income and expenses by validating the information he gave to it against his credit  report 
and the average  expense data published by the Office for National Statistics.
QuickQuid concluded that Mr D had disposable  income of £1,125  per month  to meet  
repayments of £197.60,  £235  and £1,178. It asked him to agree that, as the last payment 
was greater than his normal disposable income,  hed need  to save  over the period of the 
loan so that he could make  the last payment.
I considered that better checks would have shown QuickQuid that Mr D was gambling on 
a regular basis. Whilst I accepted that gambling  is a decision  Mr D made with regards to 
how he spent his disposable income, as a responsible lender, Id have  expected 
QuickQuid to consider  such  expenditure in the context of whether it was appropriate  to 
lend to Mr D and whether he could afford to save towards the final loan repayment.
Ref: DRN87227653I concluded that QuickQuid would have  seen that Mr D didnt have enough to save 
towards the last repayment and it shouldnt have given Mr D loan two.
For similar reasons,  I didnt think  Mr D could save  enough to meet the final repayments  
for loans 3 and 5 and the top ups.
As loan 4 was for a lower amount  and Mr Ds gambling seemed to have decreased  the 
month before he took the loan I thought  Mr D should have been able to afford  this loan 
and the top up.
Subject to any further representations from Mr D or QuickQuid,  my provisional  decision was 
that I didnt  think  QuickQuid should  have  agreed  to lend to Mr D for loans 2, 3, 3a, 5 and 5a 
(in the table  above).
QuickQuid didnt accept  my decision. In summary,  it said that it did carry out enhanced 
checks and it couldnt reasonably know that Mr D was gambling.
Mr D responded to say that this was one of the most difficult and hard periods of his life. 
When he realised that at the end of three months  he had to pay more than half his salary it 
left him little option  but to apply for another loan so that he could pay his living expenses.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid has said that it did take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. It says that it asked Mr D about his other credit commitments  and these  
included short term/payday loans. It then validated this information against a report  it 
obtained through a third-party  credit  reference agency (CRA), which I understand provided  
data about national income  and expenditure figures held by the Office of National Statistics 
(ONS). It estimated  that Mr D had a disposable  income of £1,125 for loan 2, £1,158 for loan 
3 and £807 for loan 5 and, based on this, considered Mr D could afford to repay the loans.
But before considering whether or not this might be sustainably affordable  for Mr D, I dont 
think it was reasonable  in these instances  for QuickQuid to make the assumption that he 
was in a position to be able to save money  over time to meet  the loan repayments. I noted 
that Mr D was given  a three payment  loan where  the highest monthly repayment was in 
excess of what QuickQuid  had recorded  as his monthly disposable income.  And Mr D asked 
QuickQuid for additional borrowing (or to top up) loans 3, 4 and 5 within a few days  of 
borrowing the principal  amount.  I thought  this should have alerted QuickQuid to the 
possibility that Mr D mightve been seeking  further  funds to cover  the hole left in his finances 
by the repayment of the previous loans. Mr Ds actions during the course  of his lending  
history with QuickQuid suggests it was unlikely that hed be able to carry over disposable 
income into month three,  even though he mightve  been aware  thats what he needed to do 
so. So my view that QuickQuid should not have agreed these  loans for Mr D remains  
unchanged.
putting things right
Ref: DRN87227654I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr D for the loans 2, 3, 3a, 5 and 5a 
(in the table  above). So, in order to put things right, for each of those loans QuickQuid 
should:
refund  any interest and charges  applied to the loans (2, 3, 3a, 5, 5a) 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ds credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to 
put things right as detailed above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
