The complaint
Mr P complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) processed his cash 
withdrawal from the wrong account causing an unarranged overdraft. He is unhappy with 
their actions to recover the money resulting in adverse information being recorded on his 
credit file.
What happened
In October 2019, Mr P went to a NatWest branch to withdraw money from his savings 
account. NatWest incorrectly gave Mr P the money from his current account. This resulted in 
an unarranged overdraft.
NatWest wrote to Mr P several times asking him to repay the overdraft. They didnt receive a 
reply so they sent a notice dated 1 December 2019 saying that formal demand would be 
made on or after 18th December 2019.
Mr P wrote to NatWest on 23 December 2019 confirming that hed now received the letters. 
He told NatWest that he no longer lived at the mailing address used. Hed checked his bank 
statements and complained that the cash withdrawal had been taken from the wrong 
account. He said that he had only just become aware and wanted the bank to stop the 
recovery process while his complaint was investigated.  He confirmed that his mail was now 
being redirected and said that letters could continue to be sent to this address as he should 
receive them. He also provided email contact details.
NatWest replied to Mr P on 14 January 2020. They emailed the letter again on 21 January 
2020 as he hadnt received it. They agreed with Mr Ps complaint about the cash withdrawal, 
apologised and offered to compensate him with £100. They asked him to call their 
collections department promptly to arrange repayment. They confirmed that they had 
removed any adverse data recorded from 4th October 2019 to 31 January 2020 because of 
their error.
Mr P rang NatWests collections department on 17 February 2020. He waited 45 minutes to 
speak to someone and was told that they couldnt find his letters and that his account had 
been transferred to their recoveries department. So, Mr P wrote to NatWest again on 18th 
February 2020 to complain about his treatment and said that a specific timescale hadnt 
been given to contact the collections department. He was also unhappy with the tone of 
NatWests letters.
NatWest replied on 25 February 2020 agreeing to Mr Ps complaint and apologising about 
the wait and his missing letter. But they did not agree that they had not been clear about 
when he should contact the collections department. NatWest offered further compensation of 
£75 for the agreed complaint.
NatWest wrote to Mr P again on 2 March as they hadnt amended his credit file as agreed. 
They confirmed that this had now been corrected and offered a further £20 compensation. 
This was followed by another letter where NatWest said that they hadnt addressed his 
earlier call waiting time. They sent a box of chocolates to apologise.
In the absence of the debt being repaid or a repayment agreement Mr Ps debt was 
transferred to a debt collection agency.
Mr P is still unhappy with NatWests responses to his complaints. In particular, he is 
concerned about the impact upon his credit history records. So, he referred his complaint to 
this service. One of our investigators has looked into Mr Ps complaint. He agreed that 
NatWest had made errors here. He thought that their responses and compensation were fair 
in the circumstances. But he did not agree that NatWest needed to do anything more.
Mr P was unhappy with the outcome and has asked for his complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There appears to be four main issues:
The cash withdrawal,
Repayment of the outstanding debt,
The impact upon Mr Ps credit history record,
The service provided by NatWests Collections department.
I shall address each aspect separately.
The cash withdrawal
NatWest have provided printouts of Mr Ps accounts at the time of the withdrawal. It is clear 
that there wasnt enough money on his current account to cover the cash withdrawal 
requested. The printouts do show that there were plenty of funds available in his savings 
account.
NatWest said that they made a mistake here. They have said that it appears to be down to 
human error. They have apologised in writing and paid compensation of £100 to Mr P. I think 
thats fair to reflect the impact this mistake would have had on Mr P  so Ive gone on to 
think about whether NatWest should do anything more here.
Repayment of the outstanding debt
While NatWest made a mistake in taking the money from the account they did  Mr P 
nonetheless received that money. But when Mr P received that money it created an 
unauthorised overdraft, which means that the money Mr P received wasnt taken from his 
savings or any available balance. Strictly speaking  the money he received was NatWests, 
so NatWest is entitled to ask him to repay this. Shortly after withdrawing the money, Mr P 
transferred the balance of his savings account. This meant that NatWest had no clear source 
from which the money could be repaid.
NatWest wrote to Mr P on a number of occasions. But Mr P had moved away from that 
address and had not provided NatWest with new contact details. I have seen NatWests 
Current Account Terms. They say, If your contact details change, you should tell us as soon 
as you can to ensure you receive our communications. NatWest asked Mr P to provide his 
new address details in their letter of 14th January. I havent seen anything to confirm that Mr P has provided these to NatWest. So, I cant hold NatWest responsible for Mr P not 
receiving any letters theyd sent.
Regarding the transfer of his account to the Recoveries department, NatWest explained that 
their letter of 14 January 2020 had asked that he contact their Collections department 
promptly to arrange repayment. Although there was no specific date mentioned, I think this 
did make Mr P aware that he needed to act sooner rather than later in respect of what he 
owed here. But Mr P didnt contact them for almost four weeks after NatWests letter. Thats 
a long time, without any clear reason why he took that long to get back to NatWest and so I 
think its fair that NatWest then took the steps that they did.
The impact upon Mr Ps credit history record
 
NatWest confirmed in their letter of 14 January 2020 that they had removed any reference to 
the debt from Mr Ps credit history for the period from the withdrawal in October to 31 
January 2020. They also asked Mr P to contact their collection department promptly to 
agree repayment of the amount owed. Although the situation is unfortunate, I think that 
NatWest were fair about this and couldnt have done anything more. Their response and 
actions would put Mr P back in to the position that he should be and provide time to make 
arrangements to clear the debt before the end of the month.
NatWest later admitted that the amendment to Mr Ps credit history had failed. They 
apologised again and confirmed that it would be corrected. They paid further compensation 
of £20. I can see how this would further upset Mr P. But I think NatWest did the right thing in 
promptly telling him and making sure that they put things right.
So, as regards Mr Ps various complaints, once he contacted NatWest, they looked at and 
responded to each one and paid compensation, where appropriate. I think that they acted 
fairly on each occasion.
 
So, looking at everything in balance, I believe that if Mr P had repaid the debt promptly 
following NatWests letter of 14th January 2020 and before 31 January 2020, then his credit 
history would have been clear of any adverse information. NatWest had cleared the adverse 
information up to that point. Unfortunately, Mr P chose not to repay the debt during this 
period. This led to NatWest transferring the debt to their Recoveries department and the 
default being recorded.  All banks have an obligation to ensure that the information recorded 
with credit reference agencies is accurate. Because the debt remains outstanding, I agree 
that NatWest shouldnt be removing the default from Mr Ps history.
The service provided by NatWests Collections department 
NatWest have apologised for the delays on the phone that Mr P experienced.  They also 
apologised that his letters could not be found when he called. They paid a further £75 in 
compensation. I can appreciate how telephone lines can be very busy at peak times during 
the day. I think NatWests response was very fair here too.
NatWest also explained that the content of their letters was regulatory and factual. They 
apologised if their tone had caused offence.
 
Overall, the various mistakes made by NatWest are unfortunate and do complicate things 
here. However, I think they have addressed these in a fair and reasonable way. The issue 
remains that Mr P still owes NatWest the debt. Im satisfied this is legitimately owed to 
NatWest and that it is entitled to chase this as it has done here. For this reason, I shall not 
be asking NatWest to do any more.My final decision
For the reasons set out above I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2021.
