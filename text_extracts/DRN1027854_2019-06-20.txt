K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. He said 
these loans werent affordable and he had to borrow  again  to make the repayments to his 
existing loans. This caused him financial problems. 
background
This complaint is about 19 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr H between  January 2010 
and January 2015. Mr Hs lending history  is in a table at the end of this decision. 
QuickQuid didnt think that the financial Ombudsman Service should look at loans 1 to 7 as it 
said that Mr H had brought them  outside of our time limits. After some correspondence,  Mr H 
withdrew his complaint about these loans.  So I havent looked at loans 1 to 7 as they are no 
longer part of this dispute.  But I have thought about them  when Ive looked at the other loans 
Mr H took. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint and thought  the loans 8 to 19a shouldnt have been 
given. QuickQuid disagreed, it said that:
the adjudicator  shouldve  looked in more detail  about Mr Hs income  and expenditure 
before saying the complaint should be upheld
the regulators rules, contained in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) section 
5, dont say that reborowing is in itself wrong. So he shouldnt  have upheld the 
complaint on this basis
As no agreement was reached  the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN10278542refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying  that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because CONC defines  sustainable as being  without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
I havent looked in detail  at Mr Hs income  and expenditure for each  loan for loans 8 to 19a. I 
dont think this is needed here.  QuidQuid  should be aware of our approach  to reborrowing. 
Its published on our website and it has received decisions about it before. So I wont  look at 
this in detail but I will point QuickQuid to CONC 6.7.22G which  says A firm should  not allow 
a customer to enter into consecutive agreements with the firm for high-cost short-term  credit 
if the cumulative  effect of the agreements would be that the total amount payable by the 
customer is unsustainable. And similar guidance is given in the Office of Fair trading 
regulations which apply to some  of the earlier loans.  
So Ive looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
By the time Mr H took loan 8 he had been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for around  a 
year and a half. I can see there  were some  breaks in the lending but I dont think  
these were long enough for QuickQuid to have  thought Mr Hs circumstances had 
improved substantially.
Mr H borrowed  large amounts from QuickQuid. Loan 1 was for £400 but this quickly 
increased to around £1,500 for loans 4 and 5. He borrowed  around this amount for 
the remainder of the lending. The largest  repayment  for each of these loans was over 
half of his declared income. 
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. He had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect;  service  a debt to QuickQuid over an extended 
period. QuickQuids records shows that Mr H borrowed  over 5.1 years. He took loans 
with a value of £24,350 and he repaid  interest of £9,072.80
Ref: DRN10278543So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr H was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness had become unsustainable.
I think that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  8 to 19a and QuickQuid should put things  
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 8 to 19a
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 19a should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr H compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 July 2019.
