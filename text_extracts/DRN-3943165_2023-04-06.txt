The complaint
Miss T complains that Monzo Bank Ltd wont refund money she lost when she fell victim to a 
scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties. So rather than repeat them all 
again here, Ill briefly summarise the key points.
Miss T was contacted by a fraudster with a job opportunity. As part of this, she was 
convinced to open an account with Binance, top this up and send money to a fraudsters 
wallet  she was told shed get this money back and with more money available, shed be 
able to earn a higher commission. 
Having realised shed been scammed, Miss T told Monzo about what happened. It declined 
to refund her as the money had been sent to an account in her name, so it didnt think the 
payments that left her Monzo account were the cause of her loss. Unhappy, Miss T brought 
her complaint to our service to investigate. 
Below is a summary of the payments in dispute which were all made to Skrill Ltd by faster 
payment:

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
In line with the Payment Services Regulations 2017, Monzo is expected to execute 
authorised payment instructions without undue delay. Its not in dispute that Miss T 
was scammed. But nor is it in dispute that she authorised the payments. So the 
starting position is that its fair to hold the account holder, rather than the bank, liable. 
But there are some situations where we believe that banks  taking into account 
relevant rules, codes and best practice  ought to have identified a fraud risk, so 
should have looked at the wider circumstances surrounding the transaction before 
making the payment. If Monzo failed to do so, and that failure led to a fraudulent loss, 
it might be fair to hold it liable.
I can understand why Monzo simply processed the payments on 26 and 27 May 
2022 without completing additional checks. While there were multiple payments in a 
relatively short space of time, these werent for significant amounts  most were for 
£10 or fewer. 
But I think Monzo ought to have been concerned by the fourth payment to Skrill Ltd 
on 28 May 2022 for £1,130. This was the fourth payment that day, and the third 
payment in just over an hour to the same payee. The amount had also increased  to 
over £1,000. Taking this all together, I think it represented a significant departure 
from how the account usually operated.
Monzo submit that because the payments all went to an account in Miss Ts name, it 
didnt have cause for concern. But it remained that it didnt know the circumstances 
surrounding what was a remarkable pattern of payments that had emerged. And by 
2022, Im satisfied Monzo had a good understanding that scams often involve 
someone moving money to an account with a cryptocurrency provider in their own 
name before moving it on again to the fraudster. Therefore, I dont think the fact they 
went to Miss Ts account means Monzo was reasonable to conclude she wasnt at 
risk of fraud. 
If Monzo had questioned Miss T about what the payment was for, I think she 
wouldve been upfront that it was part of a job opportunity she was contacted about 
online, where she was being asked to pay on the basis that shed receive it back plus 
commission. I think this ought to have concerned Monzo and, had it warned her that 
it sounded like a scam, I think its likely shed have stopped dealing with the 
fraudsters. 
So, in summary, giving the unusual pattern and value, I think Monzo ought to have 
been concerned when Miss T attempted a further payment to Skrill for £1,130. And I 
consider it likely the scam could have been uncovered at this point  preventing the 
further loss from this account. 
However, Ive also considered whether Miss T should fairly be held partly responsible 
for what happened by way of contributory negligence. The starting point for this is 
considering what a reasonable person would be expected to have done in the 
circumstances. 
Miss T was contacted by someone out of the blue online about a job where shed be 
paid relatively well for seemingly straightforward tasks. So I think there was a 
question about whether this was too good to be true. 
I realise she initially received a payment from the fraudsters that reassured her it was 
genuine. But I think she ought reasonably to have worried when she was asked to transfer her own money to keep earning  and that she could earn a higher 
commission if she transferred higher sums. Having reviewed her WhatsApp 
conversations with the fraudsters, the reasons she was given for spending her own 
money were difficult to make sense of and at odds with the advert she received that 
the job didnt include any fees. 
Despite these red flags, Ive not seen that Miss T carried out any of her own research 
to satisfy herself that the company was genuine before she made the payments. 
Taking all of this into account, I consider it fair to reduce the compensation by 50% 
due to contributory negligence. 
Putting things right
Monzo should refund Miss T £3,896  comprising 50% of her loss from the payment for 
£1,130 onwards. For ease, here is a table breaking this down: 
Date Amount Amount Monzo should refund
28 May 2022 £1,130 £565
28 May 2022 £2,220 £1,110
29 May 2022 £4,442 £2,221
Total £7,792 £3,896
Monzo should also pay 8% simple interest per year on this amount, accruing from the dates 
of payment to the date of settlement, less any tax lawfully deductible. This is to compensate 
Miss T for the time shes been deprived of these funds.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Monzo Bank Ltd to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2023.
