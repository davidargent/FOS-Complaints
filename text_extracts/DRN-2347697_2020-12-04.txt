The complaint
Mr B complains, as a sole proprietor of a company  which Ill refer to as company A, about 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs (PayPal) refusal to offer seller protection on an item 
company A sold. The payment transaction was reversed and Mr B wants PayPal to refund 
this and pay compensation of £200.   
What happened
Company A sold an item and received payment of £225 through its Paypal account. 
The buyer then opened a dispute and Mr B escalated the dispute to a claim. The buyer then 
changed the reason of his complaint from non-receipt to the item being Significantly Not as 
Described. PayPal then allowed the buyer to return the item and later found the claim in the 
buyers favour. PayPal reversed the payment from company As account but, because there 
werent sufficient funds in this account, when the reversal was completed, it created a 
negative balance. Mr B appealed the decision but this was denied.      
 
Mr B complained to PayPal and they said they had used the correct procedures and had 
acted in line with their User Agreement. They said, without any admission of liability, they 
were willing to issue a credit to company As PayPal account in the amount of £225.37 in 
order to resolve the negative balance on the account.  
Our investigator looked into things for company A. She thought PayPal had acted in line with 
their User Agreement. She felt PayPals offer to credit company As account was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances and wouldnt be asking them to do anything further. Mr B 
wanted PayPal to pay this directly into his bank account. PayPal refused and said they could 
only credit company As Paypal account. Mr B then asked for the credit to be applied to a 
separate PayPal account. PayPal refused and said they consider company A to be liable for 
the outstanding balance, but as a gesture, theyve made an offer to resolve the negative 
balance on company As account so the credit would only be applied to that account. Mr B 
disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr B will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
claim. 
I can see PayPals User Agreement sets out the steps which form part of the dispute 
resolution process. This says that, where a buyer and seller cant reach an amicable 
settlement, then PayPal will make a final decision. It goes on to say that if a buyer files a 
Significantly Not as Described claim, PayPal may require them, at their expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller. Ive seen from information provided by PayPal, they allowed the 
buyer to do this and the item was returned. The buyer provided tracking information and, 
according to the tracking number, the item shows as having been returned. This allowed the 
buyer to be eligible for PayPals Buyer Protection. 
PayPals Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on Sellers section of the User Agreement says,
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Describedyou may 
be required to accept the item back   
The User Agreement also allows PayPal to reverse payments where a buyer has made a 
PayPal Buyer Protection claim against a seller. So, taking this all into account, I think PayPal 
have followed their policy and it wasnt unreasonable for them to deal with the claim under 
their Buyer Protection process. The buyer had returned the item and, having then found in 
their favour, PayPal reversed the payment which had been made to company As account.     
I understand Mr B feels PayPal havent considered his claim under their Seller Protection 
process, but from the information Ive seen, I think they have. The Seller Protection process 
says, 
You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a 
timely mannerIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and 
other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for PayPal Seller 
Protection.
Ive seen that, when the decision was communicated to Mr B, he was given the option to 
appeal  which he did. PayPal then listed the conditions under which an appeal could be 
considered. They also set out further steps Mr B needed to take, this included obtaining a 
police report or completing an affidavit. They set out a time frame by which they needed this 
information. They also said if they dont receive a response by the date listed, then they will 
consider the appeal closed. Having not heard back, PayPal didnt grant Mr Bs appeal and 
wrote to him confirming this. So, I think PayPal have acted fairly and reasonably in dealing 
with the claim and have acted in line with their User Agreement.
PayPal have already made an offer to credit company As account by £225.37 to settle the 
complaint. I dont think PayPal are being unreasonable in saying the credit can only be 
applied to company As account. This has been made as a gesture and in order to resolve 
the negative balance on the account. Mr B should contact PayPal directly if he now wishes 
to accept this.
  
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld and I 
wont be asking PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take any further action.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask company A to 
accept or reject my decision before 1 January 2021.
