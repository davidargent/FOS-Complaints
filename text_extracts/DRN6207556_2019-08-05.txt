K820x#14complaint
Mr Cs unhappy that National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest)  are chasing him for payment 
of a debt on a personal credit card account  which he thought  had been paid off in 2016. 
background
NatWest say that Mr C held a personal  credit card account with them,  and the last payment 
for this account was made in December  2012.  Due to financial difficulties Mr C filed for 
Bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy was annulled by the Court in 2013 because  Mr C appointed  an 
insolvency practitioner (IP) to manage  his individual voluntary arrangement  (IVA). 
Mr C has provided a copy of a letter sent by his IP to NatWest in October 2013. The letter  
referred specifically to a business account, and asked whether NatWest wanted to make a 
claim from the IVA. The response from NatWest  confirmed that there  wasnt a balance  on 
the business account referred to.
On 1 December  2014, Mr Cs IVA failed. Mr C says that in September  2016  he took out a 
loan, and paid all his creditors  in full. Mr Cs IP applied to the Court to have the outstanding 
bankruptcy petition dismissed, which was granted in September  2016. 
NatWest say they were  informed in March 2018  that Mr Cs IVA had failed. Because  of this, 
they started  pursuing  Mr C directly  for the balance owed on his personal credit card account.
Mr C complained to NatWest about them  chasing him for this debt as he believed all his 
outstanding debts had been cleared  in 2016. Mr C says NatWest should  waive  this debt. 
NatWest say they only found out that the IVA failed  in 2018, so thats  why they only started 
chasing Mr C from this time. 
The investigator was empathetic  to Mr Cs circumstances but found that NatWest  acted  fairly  
in chasing Mr C. This was because  theres no evidence of the personal credit  card debt 
being repaid to NatWest, and so theyre entitled  to contact  Mr C directly for payment. Mr C 
didnt agree with this, saying that NatWest  held his home address and shouldve contacted 
him, and that it seems  likely  that NatWest have sold the debt.  As the complaint couldnt  be 
resolved, its been passed to me for decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I understand that this has been  an 
upsetting time for Mr C. Having reviewed the case, I think NatWest  have acted  fairly,  and I 
wont be recommending  they do anything more.
Mr C feels strongly  that when he appointed an IP in 2013 to manage his IVA, NatWest were 
contacted and they didnt  advise the IP of any outstanding debt owed to them. Ive seen that 
Mr Cs IP did contact  NatWest in 2013, but the letter was specifically asking about  Mr Cs 
business account. NatWest responded saying there wasnt a balance  on Mr Cs business 
account. I understand Mr Cs comments that NatWest shouldve  told the IP about  the 
personal credit card account at the time.  
In this case I think its fair that NatWest provided a response to the specific  account  that was 
detailed in the letter sent to them in 2013.  The letter was asking NatWest if they wanted to 
Ref: DRN62075562make a claim for Mr Cs business account, and this was the account  NatWest provided a 
response for. So I cant say theyve  acted unfairly  by failing to provide details of the personal 
credit card account debt.  
Mr C says NatWest  shouldve  contacted him at his home address. As Mr Cs IVA was being 
managed by his IP it was reasonable for NatWest to have corresponded directly with the IP, 
so I cant say theyve  acted unreasonably here.  
Mr C says NatWest  shouldve  contacted him sooner about the outstanding debt. I accept 
that it mustve come  as a shock to Mr C when he was contacted by NatWest  about a debt he 
thought had been settled  in 2016.  Overall  I dont think the amount of time between  Mr C 
thinking that his debts  had cleared in 2016, and NatWest contacting him in 2018  was 
unreasonable. In reaching this view Ive considered that theres no evidence to show  that the 
debt had been settled. I think it was fair for NatWest to contact Mr C at the first opportunity 
that they became aware that the IVA had failed. 
Mr C says its likely NatWest have sold his debt.  I havent seen any evidence to say this is 
the case. So I cant say theyve done something  wrong here. 
The evidence shows Mr C had a personal  credit card account  with NatWest, and the last 
payment for this account  was made  in December  2012, with an outstanding  balance 
remaining due. I havent seen any evidence to say that the outstanding balance  has been  
cleared. I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest  to waive  this debt. 
my final decision
For the reasons  provided I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 September 2019.
