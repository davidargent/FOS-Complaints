The complaint
Mr M complains that ReAssure Limited (ReAssure) provided incorrect valuation statements 
for his pension. This led to concern about his pension. 
What happened
Mr M has a pension policy with ReAssure. 
Mr M said that the following had occurred:
-The statement he received on 17 September 2018 gave the value of his pension as 
£23,224.24. He said that this was £74,167.64 lower that the previous statement hed 
received on 4 April 2017. 
-Mr M said hed requested a correction of this statement by phone, but that this hadnt 
happened. 
-The statement he received on 27 February 2019 gave the value of his pension as 
£23,007.38. 
-Mr M said hed requested a correction of this statement by phone. He said that he 
received a correction letter dated 1 April 2019 which gave the pension value as 
£109,028.20.
-Mr M said he received a statement dated 28 September 2019 which gave the 
pension value as £121,661.73. 
Ive not been sent copies of the statements referenced above. But I have seen copies of the 
statements covered in the next section.
ReAssure sent Mr M an annual pension statement dated 25 February 2020 which gave the 
value of his pension as at 21 February 2020 as £25,578.78. He said this was almost 
£100,000 lower than the value shown on the September 2019 statement. 
Mr M called ReAssure on 9 March 2020 about his concern that his pension had fallen in 
value. ReAssure confirmed the same day that the February 2020 annual statement was 
wrong. They said theyd send a corrected statement. The call note recorded that Mr M was: 
a little disgruntled as this is the second time he has been quoted incorrect values. It also 
noted that a warning flag would be added to stop the problem from happening again.
ReAssure sent Mr M a new statement dated 10 March 2020. This showed that the value of 
his pension on 9 March 2020 was £121,156.53.
ReAssure sent a further statement to Mr M dated 4 August 2020. This showed that the value 
was £23,936.72 on 28 July 2020. Mr M requested a corrected statement by phone. 
ReAssure issued a further statement to Mr M dated 18 September 2020. This stated that as 
at 15 September 2020 the pension fund value was £45,545.17 and the transfer value was 
£116,224.94. The letter apologised for any previous incorrect information and provided a 
brief explanation about why the values given were different. 
Mr M called ReAssure on 24 September 2020. He said the 18 September 2020 letter hadnt 
mentioned the value of his protected rights. ReAssures call note recorded that this was: 
apparently a system error, the flag doesnt work ref manual statements. The notes also 
stated that Mr M was: very confused and fed up and that they needed to provide Mr M with 
clear information on how the protected rights were calculated. 
ReAssure sent a further letter dated 28 September 2020. This included a table showing the 
price, units and value for the same managed fund, in three separate rows. The letter stated 
that both the fund value and the transfer value were £23,768.09 of which £9,305.89 was 
protected rights.
Mr M called ReAssure to query this letter on 2 October 2020. He said he felt that the 28 
September 2020 letter had been intended to correct the letter sent on 18 September 2020, 
which itself had tried to correct the information provided in the 4 August 2020 statement. Mr 
M said he felt as if hed been trying to get a correct valuation since 10 March 2020. The call 
note recorded that Mr M was very unhappy. And noted that the valuation sent on the 28 
September 2020 was: completely wrong.
ReAssure sent a corrected statement to Mr M on 5 October 2020, with values as at 4 
October 2020. The statement included a table showing the price, units and value for two 
different funds, with each fund shown in three separate rows of the table. This stated that the 
pension fund value was £45,237.01 and the transfer value was £115,963.33. 
The 5 October 2020 letter also included the pension fund value and transfer value as at 10 
March 2020. It said these were £43,311.92 and £119,972.85 respectively.
Mr M complained to ReAssure on 10 October 2020. He said hed received contradictory 
information. He said that the 5 October 2020 letter gave a different value for the fund as at 
10 March 2020 from the letter dated 10 March 2020.  He wanted to know which valuation 
had been correct.
Mr M felt that the statements hed been sent hadnt been consistent. And that hed 
repeatedly been sent valuations which were too low. He felt hed had to try on a number of 
occasions to get the correct values. He also queried the value of his protected rights and 
said that he had no way of confirming the value of this himself. Mr M said that he was 
increasingly concerned, given how close he was to his retirement age, that the figures being 
quoted were incorrect.
ReAssure issued their final response to the complaint on 9 November 2020. They 
acknowledged that theyd provided Mr M with incorrect information which had caused him 
some concerns. They apologised for providing incorrect information. And said that Mr M had 
now received the correct information, including the Protected Rights element. ReAssure 
didnt offer any compensation for their errors or the distress and inconvenience theyd 
caused Mr M. 
Unhappy with the response, Mr M brought his complaint to this service. He said that 
ReAssure hadnt called him when they said they would. And that although the final response 
letter had stated that hed been provided with the correct information, he hadnt been given 
everything he'd requested. 
Our investigator felt that the complaint should be upheld. He felt that ReAssure had caused 
Mr M distress and inconvenience. And that they should pay him £300 compensation. He also felt that ReAssure should provide Mr M with a clear and accurate updated statement which 
included a breakdown of his protected rights, as hed requested. 
ReAssure didnt agree with our investigator. They felt that the letter theyd issued on 5 
October 2020 had confirmed why the values hed been provided with previously were 
incorrect. They acknowledged that the incorrect values theyd given him mayve caused Mr 
M upset, but said hed been free to contact them at any point about his concerns. They 
apologised for sending conflicting information. But felt that they hadnt caused him to suffer 
any financial loss. And felt that no compensation should be paid.
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has come to me for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im going to uphold it. I agree with our investigator that ReAssure should 
provide Mr M with compensation for the distress and inconvenience theyve caused him. Ill 
explain the reasons for my decision. 
ReAssures position is that their apology for the incorrect statements is enough to resolve 
the complaint. They feel that as the incorrect statements didnt cause Mr M a financial loss, 
they shouldnt be required to compensate him. 
I dont agree with ReAssure that there should be no compensation just because theyve not 
caused Mr M a financial lost.
From what Ive seen, the following points that Mr M has raised with ReAssure have either yet 
to be resolved, or have yet to be fairly considered: 
-The failure to address Mr Ms query about what he felt was contradictory information 
about 10 March 2020 values in the 5 October 2020 correction letter. 
-The failure to provide Mr M with clear and accurate details about his protected rights. 
-the upset caused when ReAssure repeatedly provided Mr M with incorrect  and 
significantly lower - valuations. 
I went on to consider each of these points.
Failure to address all of Mr Ms complaint points
As I noted above, ReAssure failed to address Mr Ms query about what he felt was 
contradictory information in the 5 October 2020 letter. Im of the view that it wouldve been 
difficult for Mr M to believe that the figures quoted were correct, given how many times 
theyd been wrong. Therefore I consider that ReAssure shouldve responded to this query as 
quickly as possible in order to give Mr M confidence about the service they were providing 
him. ReAssure also failed to respond to Mr Ms request for clear and accurate details about 
his protected rights. 
ReAssure sent Mr M a statement dated 10 March 2020. This showed that the current value 
of his pension was £121,156.53 as at 9 March 2020. ReAssure also included a value as at 
10 March 2020 in their 5 October 2020 correction letter. This stated that the transfer value 
had been £119,972.85 on 10 March 2020. Mr M queried the difference in values in his complaint email of 10 October 2020. But Ive seen no reply to this point from ReAssure. 
From what Ive seen, Mr M understood that the two valuations referred to in the previous 
paragraph were both as at 10 March 2020, but actually one was as at 9 March 2020. 
Therefore I suspect that there was in fact no contradiction here. The values were simply for 
different dates. However, as I stated earlier, I consider that ReAssure shouldve replied as 
quickly as possible to Mr M to reassure him about this point. 
Mr M also requested details about the protected rights element of his pension on more than 
one occasion. But the only information Ive seen ReAssure provide on this point was within 
their 28 September 2020 letter. This said that both the fund value and the transfer value 
were £23,768.09 of which £9,305.89 was protected rights. Mr M was subsequently told by 
ReAssure that this letter was: completely wrong.
ReAssures final response letter stated that Mr M had now received corrected information 
which included the protected rights element. But that wasnt correct. The updated valuation 
information ReAssure had sent to Mr M didnt include any information on his protected rights.
Our investigator asked ReAssure to provide an updated valuation of Mr Ms protected rights. 
They did this, stating that as at 17 June 2021 the value was £54,333.76. But I dont consider 
that Mr M has been provided with a full response to his original query about his protected 
rights. As such, I consider that ReAssure should provide Mr M with a clear and accurate 
pension statement which includes a breakdown of his protected rights, in line with his 
request.
I next considered the impact on Mr M of ReAssures errors.
Incorrect information and its impact on Mr M
The evidence shows that Mr M was provided with incorrect valuations on 25 February 2020, 
4 August 2020 and 28 September 2020. Mr M has also said that ReAssure made additional 
errors before these dates. On each of these occasions the valuations stated a significantly 
lower value for Mr Ms pension. 
Mr M is relatively close to reaching his retirement age. So its clearly very important for him 
to have correct values for his pension. From what Ive seen, ReAssure have failed to give Mr 
M any comfort that the values theyve given him were correct. I would expect this to be very 
concerning for any customer, and even more so for one approaching his retirement age. 
Mr M has told this service that the incorrect values were a cause for concern. Ive also seen 
evidence that he also expressed his concerns about the incorrect valuations to ReAssure. 
ReAssure consider that as their errors didnt cause Mr M a financial loss, theres no need for 
any compensation.
This service can only consider making an award for distress or inconvenience if a complaint 
has been determined in favour of the complainant and if the businesss mistake has resulted 
in adverse consequences for the complainant. 
While ReAssure have acknowledged their mistakes, I consider that they didnt respond to 
their mistakes as well as they could have. From what Ive seen, they didnt put things right 
quickly. I say this because its evident that Mr M had to make repeated attempts to get 
incorrect statements corrected. 
ReAssure have acknowledged that they made errors in the statements they sent to Mr M. And have apologised for their errors. But as ReAssure didnt fully address all of Mr Ms 
complaint points, I dont consider that theyve fairly concluded his complaint.
From what Ive seen, Mr M has been unfairly impacted by ReAssures errors. I consider that 
ReAssures errors caused Mr M more than the levels of frustration and annoyance he might 
reasonably expect from day-to-day life. Im satisfied that the impact has been more than just 
minimal, and therefore I dont agree that an apology is enough to remedy the errors. 
Therefore I consider that compensation of £300 for the distress and inconvenience caused 
would be fair and reasonable under the circumstances of this complaint.
Im also not satisfied that the complaint has been fully dealt with as Mr Ms query about his 
protected rights has yet to be fully addressed.
For the reasons Ive given above, I uphold the complaint. 
Putting things right
ReAssure Limited must:
-Provide Mr M with a clear and accurate pension statement which includes a 
breakdown of his protected rights.
-Pay Mr M £300 for the distress and inconvenience theyve caused him.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint. I require ReAssure Limited to take the 
actions detailed in the Putting things right section above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2022.
