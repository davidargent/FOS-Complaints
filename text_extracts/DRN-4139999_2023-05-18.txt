The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has mishandled requests he 
made for his personal data.
What happened
Ms S says that in March 2021 he made a Subject Access Request (SAR) to NatWest for the 
personal data it held on him. He says he did not receive a response to this request until 
many months later, outside the required timescale, and that when he did receive NatWests 
response it did not include all the data he had requested. 
Mr S raised several complaints about this with NatWest. The first complaint was raised in 
around July 2021, and NatWest responded to that complaint in a final response letter dated 
4 August 2021. In that letter NatWest agreed that Mr S had been given poor service on a 
phone call with the bank, and that it had not yet sent him a call recording he had requested 
in March 2021. In this letter NatWest said it would pay Mr S £500 for any distress and 
inconvenience caused by this and also confirmed it would raise a SAR for all his personal 
data.
NatWests records show that it sent Mr S the SAR on 2 September 2021. But Mr S was 
unhappy with what this SAR included, he did not feel it had included all the data he had 
asked for, and he raised those concerns with NatWest. NatWest wrote to him in November 
2021 to say that it had provided all the personal data it held. At this time it appears that Mr S 
was promised a call back from the SAR team to try to resolve his concerns.
When that call back did not happen Mr S raised further concerns with NatWest in March 
2022, and NatWest confirmed that it would arrange for the SAR team to call Mr S back as 
promised. 
NatWest considered a further complaint about the data it had provided in August 2022, and 
wrote to Mr S on 4 August 2022 to explain why it had asked him certain security questions. 
But this was not the response Mr S was looking for, he had wanted to know what data 
NatWest held regarding the answers to those security questions, not why they had been 
asked. As Mr S felt his complaint was not being resolved by NatWest he referred his 
concerns to us.
At that stage NatWest considered all that had happened and agreed that it had not provided 
all the data Mr S had requested in his SAR, it offered to pay him £150 to recognise the 
impact of this. Mr S was not happy with this offer, and maintained that he still had not had all 
the information he felt should have been supplied under the SAR.
One of our Investigators looked into what had happened. They felt that there had been some 
delays in NatWest responding to the SAR, and that some data had not been included, but 
considered that overall NatWests offer to pay £150 was fair. They also noted that any 
specific concerns about the data provided under the SAR would be better addressed by the 
Information Commissioners Office (ICO).
Mr S did not agree with the Investigators findings, he felt that NatWest had failed to comply 
with the law. So as an informal agreement could not be reached, the complaint has been 
passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres a great deal of correspondence on this complaint and Mr S has provided detailed
submissions, all of which I have considered. In this decision I will focus on issues which are -
in my opinion - relevant to reaching a fair outcome to this complaint. This isnt meant as a
discourtesy to Mr S. It simply reflects the informal nature of our service. 
I also want to make it clear that our role as a dispute resolution service has its limitations, so 
I want to clarify that:
The ICO regulates compliance with data protection laws in the UK. It has a number of 
powers including the power to order businesses to comply with data protection laws. 
Only the ICO can determine whether or not an organisation has broken data 
protection laws.
This service cant act in place of the ICO, or make a finding about whether or not a 
business has broken data protection laws. But we can look at whats fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint.
Here, the complaint arises from the fact that Mr S says NatWest delayed replying to an SAR 
request, and then did not provide all the data Mr S had requested. Ive carefully considered 
what both parties have said regarding the SAR request. 
Mr S initially contacted NatWest in March 2021, Ive seen records of the contact between 
Mr S and NatWest at that time and it seems clear that Mr Ss request at that stage related 
only to copies of call recordings rather than to a full SAR. NatWest has agreed that it did not 
send the relevant call recordings when requested, and paid Mr S £500 to apologise for the 
inconvenience caused. In this letter NatWest confirmed that Mr S had now asked for all the 
information NatWest held on him. And it was at this point that the full SAR request was 
raised.
NatWest sent the SAR response to Mr S on 2 September 2021, within the required 
timescale, so I dont consider that there was any delay in NatWest providing this initial SAR 
response. But I can see that there were then some issues with NatWest responding to 
Mr Ss further concerns about the data provided under the SAR.
Specifically, NatWest seems to have misunderstood what specific information Mr S was 
looking for, and did not call him back when it said it would. NatWest has agreed that it did 
not originally provide all the data Mr S was looking for, and has now provided some 
explanation as to why this happened  specifically that when collating data for an SAR it 
carries out reasonable searches in its systems but these searches did not find everything 
Mr S was looking for. NatWest says it has now provided everything it holds, including the 
specific information that Mr S requested.
I appreciate that Mr S disagrees that all the data has now been provided, but Im satisfied 
that NatWest does seem to have now taken reasonable steps to provide everything Mr S 
has asked for. And as Ive noted, it is not our role to decide whether NatWest has met its obligations under the relevant legislation, or has followed the law, that it more appropriately 
considered by the ICO as the relevant regulator.
My role is to consider whether NatWest has treated Mr S fairly and reasonably, and I 
acknowledge that errors have been made here. There were issues with the 
comprehensiveness of the data that was sent to him, and with the overall service provided to 
him. But on balance Im satisfied that £150 is reasonable compensation here.
Ultimately, while I understand Mr S may remain unhappy, the compensation that has been 
offered by NatWest is in line with what I would award, so I wont be asking it to do anything 
more.
Putting things right
NatWest should pay Mr S the £150 it has offered, if it has not already done so.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part, National Westminster Bank Plc should put things right in the 
way Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 June 2023.
