The complaint
Miss C is unhappy that NewDay Ltd increased the credit limit on her credit account on 
several occasions, all of which she feels were unaffordable for her at those times.
What happened
In March 2018, Miss C applied for a NewDay administered credit account. Her application 
was accepted, and NewDay provided Miss C with a credit account with an initial credit limit 
of £300.
In July 2018, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Cs account to £1,300. Further credit 
limit increases followed in November 2018 and January 2019, to £2,000 and £3,750 
respectively.
In 2021, Miss C raised a complaint with NewDay because she felt the later credit limit 
increases had been unaffordable for her at those times, and that this should have been 
apparent to NewDay, had they undertaken checks into her financial position before 
approving her for those increases.
NewDay looked at Miss Cs complaint. They confirmed that in all instances they had 
undertaken checks into Miss Cs financial position before offering credit to her. NewDay also 
explained that there had been nothing resulting from these checks which they felt should 
have given them cause to suspect that Miss C might not be able to afford any of the credit 
being offered to her. Because of this, NewDay didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint.
Miss C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They didnt feel that the 
information that NewDay had assessed before increasing the credit limit from £300 to £1,300 
did reasonably suggest that Miss C would in all likelihood be able to afford such an increase. 
So, they recommended that this complaint be upheld in Miss Cs favour on that basis. 
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a  
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for 
that customer at that time.
NewDay contend that they did that here and note that before approving Miss Cs initial 
application for credit they took details from Miss C of her annual income to assess whether 
they payments that might become due on the account would likely be affordable for her. 
NewDay also confirm that they reviewed information about Miss C obtained from a credit 
reference agency to get a better understanding of Miss Cs wider financial position at that 
time. And NewDay maintain that there was nothing resulting from these checks that should 
reasonably have given them cause to suspect that Miss C might not be able to afford the 
credit account with an initial credit limit of £300.
Having reviewed the information that NewDay assessed in this regard, its notable that Miss 
C confirmed to NewDay that her annual income at the point of application was £17,799. This 
equates to a net monthly income of approximately £1,300.
Miss C also confirmed to NewDay that she was living in rented accommodation, and the 
information that NewDay obtained from the credit reference agency included that Miss C had 
six historical defaults with a combined default balance of £13,800, as well as an outstanding 
payday loan with a balance of £804.
Given Miss Cs relatively low monthly income at that time, as well has her high levels of 
existing credit commitments  which totalled approximately 80% of Miss Cs gross annual 
income  I find it difficult to conclude that any further provision of credit was affordable for 
Miss C at that time, especially without a more detailed analysis of Miss Cs expenditure, 
including her rental and other essential expenditure, which I feel the information referenced 
above should have promoted NewDay to investigate and which NewDay notably didnt 
undertake.
However, Miss C has confirmed that she was looking to improve her credit score at that time 
and that it was through a third-party credit score improvement website that she was 
approached by NewDay and offered a credit account with the reasonably low credit limit of 
£300. And Miss C has further confirmed that she felt this low credit limit was manageable for 
her and that she was happy with it. And so, on that basis it does seem reasonable to me that 
NewDay would have approved Miss C for a new credit account with an initial credit limit of 
£300 in March 2018.
 
But in July 2018, just four months after approving Miss C for a credit account with a £300 
credit limit, NewDay increased the credit limit on the account by over 430%, to £1,300. Very 
little appears to have changed in regard to Miss Cs personal and financial circumstances to 
have prompted such a dramatic credit limit increase, and its notable that Miss C still had a 
significant combined default balance and was still paying off her payday loan, such that her 
debt to income ratio remained prohibitively high. 
Furthermore, in the two months immediately preceding the credit limit increase, Miss C had 
used the NewDay credit account to withdraw cash and had incurred charges on the account 
as a result. Because of such cash withdrawal charges, using a credit account to withdraw 
cash is a high cost way for in individual to withdraw cash, and I feel that this should have 
been highly suggestive to NewDay that Miss C might have struggling financially at that time, 
such that the provision of further credit to her might not be in her best interests.
Ultimately, taking all the information above into consideration, I dont feel that it was fair and 
reasonable for NewDay to have increased the credit limit on Miss Cs account in the manner 
that they did here, and Im satisfied that the information that was available to NewDay at that 
time should have reasonably given NewDay cause to suspect that Miss C might not be able 
to afford any further credit at that time such that further credit shouldnt have been offered to 
her.All of which means that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss Cs favour on the basis that I 
feel that the credit limit increase from £300 to £1,300 that took place in July 2018 shouldnt 
have been provided to Miss C by NewDay.  
I realise that this might not be the outcome that NewDay were wanting, but I trust that theyll 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Cs account all charges and fees incurred on the account 
after the point of the credit limit increase in July 2018. 
NewDay must also reimburse to Miss Cs account all interest accrued on any portion of the 
account balance over £300 from the point of the credit limit increase in July 2018.
If these reimbursements result in an account balance in Miss Cs favour, NewDay must pay 
this balance to Miss C along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of payment.
If, following the above reimbursements, a balance remains outstanding for Miss C to pay, 
NewDay should provide appropriate forbearance to Miss C if necessary to help her to pay 
back that balance, ensuring that no interest is accrued on any portion of the balance that 
remains over £300.
Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse credit reporting relating to this account from July 
2018 onwards.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 April 2022.
