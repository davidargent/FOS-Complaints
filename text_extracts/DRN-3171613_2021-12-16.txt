The complaint
Mrs A complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) for its handling of her 
concerns that money was being taken from her account. She wants NatWest to open a 
replacement account for her, with a corresponding overdraft, and to compensate her for her 
distress and inconvenience.   
What happened
Mrs A purchased some jewellery from a retailer. At that time, she used her NatWest card, 
and set up a repayment plan for the items to spread the cost. 
Some items did not arrive and, when others did, they were of poor quality. Mrs A returned 
these to the retailer.
Mrs A noticed that payments continued to leave her account to the retailer. She cancelled 
her card and alerted NatWest that, to her mind, the transactions were not authorised. 
NatWest opened a fraud claim and investigated.
Some days later NatWest declined Mrs As fraud claim as it had established that the retailer 
was continuing to take pre-authorised repayments as part of a plan. NatWest rejected the 
fraud claim. 
Mrs A had a number of calls with NatWest and, during these, it became clear that she ought 
to have issued a chargeback claim for the goods, and that she was not advised of this earlier 
by NatWest. 
In the meantime, some continuing payments to retailers have been taken from Mrs As 
account, despite her having cancelled the card that was used, and alerting NatWest that she 
did not now authorise the payments. 
NatWest ultimately proceeded with a chargeback claim and refunded Mrs A the money that 
had been paid towards the jewellery. 
Mrs A complained to NatWest, she felt that NatWests handling of matters had caused her 
great stress and inconvenience and she wanted her account to be made into a new account, 
with her same overdraft facility, so that she would not have any further payments taken from 
her account relating to transactions made on old cards. 
NatWest replied to her complaint. It considered that it had not acted wrongly in declining the 
fraud claims, but acknowledged that there had been customer service failings in the way it 
had handled matters. NatWest offered Mrs A £100 compensation and £15 to reflect her call 
costs. 
Mrs A was not happy with this and contacted us. 
Our investigator partially upheld Mrs As complaint. He thought that NatWest had acted 
reasonably in declining the fraud claims and in advising Mrs A that an overdraft on a new 
account would be subject to a credit check and affordability check. He thought that the 
compensation offered by NatWest was insufficient to reflect the distress Mrs A had been 
caused, so he recommended that NatWest increase this to £200.
NatWest has agreed to this resolution. Mrs A has not accepted his view. She thinks that the 
amount of compensation he put forward is not enough to reflect the time she spent on the 
phone and the upset she has suffered.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have read the view issued by my colleague and his reasons and I largely agree with him. 
NatWest has acknowledged a number of customer service failings, including a delay in 
advising Mrs A that she needed to apply for a chargeback, rather than make a fraud claim.
This is because the transaction and payment plan were initially authorised by Mrs A, and the 
issue was primarily about the quality of the goods and then that the payment plan continued 
after Mrs A had returned the goods. As such the appropriate route was always a chargeback 
dispute. 
I am pleased that Mrs A was ultimately able to obtain a refund through the proper process 
but I appreciate that this took longer than it would have done if she had been advised 
promptly that the issue was not fraud. 
I also see that Mrs A has been concerned at other continuing payments from her account 
and that she has cancelled cards and has wanted to change her account details to prevent 
this happening again. I therefore appreciate how upset Mrs A has been through this. 
I agree with the investigators comments about NatWest having to carry out checks before 
offering an overdraft on any other account, and that we cannot direct NatWest to issue an 
overdraft in the same terms. My colleague explained to Mrs A that if she is unhappy with any 
decision taken in relation to a further account, she would be able to complain about that at 
the time. 
Overall, I agree that Mrs A has received an inadequate customer service and some things 
could have been better communicated to Mrs A to allay some of her worries. I think that the 
recommended compensation put forward by my colleague, of £200 in total, is appropriate to 
reflect these failings. 
I appreciate that Mrs A does not think that this is sufficient compensation, but I am satisfied 
that it is in line with other awards we would make in similar circumstances, to customers who 
had suffered similar levels of distress and inconvenience. 
Consequently, whilst this may be disappointing for Mrs A, I agree with the investigators 
conclusions and uphold the complaint in the same terms. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mrs As complaint and direct National Westminster 
Bank Plc to:
Pay to Mrs A a total of £200 compensation for her distress and inconvenience.   Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2022.
