The complaint
Mr E complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handling of a seller dispute. 
What happened
In January 2021 Mr E sold a fishing rod through a third-party website. The buyer of the rod 
claimed the rod was damaged and raised a buyer dispute with PayPal. The fishing rod was 
returned to Mr E, he inspected it and found no damage, so he sent the rod back to the buyer. 
PayPal eventually upheld the claim in Mr Es favour and the money was returned.
Mr E raised a complaint with PayPal, as he said he didnt receive the money back after hed 
returned the item. PayPal looked into the complaint and said it had refunded Mr E and he 
had the item back  so it was unsure what his complaint was about. 
Mr E then brought his complaint to our service, and it was whilst it was with us that PayPal 
spoke to Mr E and located the refund in an old closed account. Our investigator looked into 
what happened and due to the money being paid to the closed account, thought PayPal 
should pay Mr E £100 for the inconvenience caused.
PayPal didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator for largely the same 
reasons. 
Following the investigators view, I asked PayPal for clarity on what had happened with Mr 
Es refund. PayPal said that it applied the refund in March 2021, to an account that Mr E had 
closed in January 2021. So, it did make an error. 
PayPal told our investigator that as Mr E had decided to send the rod back to the buyer 
himself, no compensation was due, as it was his choice to do so. But having considered this 
point, Im satisfied this didnt impact on the fact PayPal have delayed Mr E receiving his 
refund due to it going to the incorrect account. After all, Mr E had successfully defended the 
dispute, so was right to return the item to the buyer. 
Having considered the time Mr E spent without the refund, Im satisfied PayPal should pay 
Mr E to compensate him for this loss.
Putting things right
To compensate Mr E for being without the £389 for around seven months, Im satisfied 
PayPal should pay Mr E £100 compensation. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr E £100 compensation.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
