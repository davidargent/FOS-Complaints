The complaint
Mrs P complains that she was mis-sold an investment she made in two bonds issued by
Basset & Gold Plc (B&G plc). Mrs P says she misled that her capital would be protected
but she has since lost her money and would like this to be refunded.
What happened
The bonds Mrs P invested in were a B&G Plc 3 Year Fixed Monthly Income Bond and a
B&G 3 Year Compounding High Yield IFISA Bond. For a period of time, sales of these bonds
were dealt with by Basset Gold Ltd (BG Ltd), a separate business from B&G Plc, the issuer
of the bonds. BG Ltd arranged applications for investments in the bonds. And it was
responsible for advertising and marketing the bonds. Potential investors were also able to
call BG Ltd, to discuss the bonds.
B&G Plc and BG Ltd were both appointed representatives of Gallium Fund Solutions Limited
(Gallium). B&G Plc and BG Ltd were appointed representatives of Gallium from 17
February 2017 to 28 February 2018.
Basset Gold Finance Ltd (BGF)  an independently authorised business, which was not
connected to Gallium  took over from BG Ltd at some point in 2018. Gallium says this
happened before the appointed representative agreement between it and BG Ltd came to an
end and has made submissions on this point  albeit inconsistent ones. For the remainder of
this background section I have referred to BG Ltd as the business Mrs P interacted with, but
the point of dispute is noted, and I will consider in my findings whether Mrs P actually dealt
with BGF instead.
Mrs P and the investment in the bonds
Mrs P invested a total of Â£16,000 in the bonds.
BG Ltds log of applications records the following:

The certificates for the bond Mrs P actually invested in records the applications dates as 29
September 2017 for the B&G Plc 3 Year Fixed Monthly Income Bond and 2 February 2018
for the B&G 3 Year Compounding High Yield IFISA Bond.
Mrs P says she doesnt recall much about the application process but remembers having
phone discussions with representative of BG Ltd.
Mrs P was retired at the time of investing and says she was attracted to the bonds as they
had a good return of interest and were protected by the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (FSCS) if they failed. She also says she had previously only invested in ISAs,
shares and savings accounts.
On 8 January 2019, B&G Finance Limited (which by that point had taken on the role of BG
Ltd), sent an email to all investors then holding B&G Plc bonds. This referred to the fact that
nearly all the money invested in B&G Plc bonds had been lent to one short term and pay day
lender, called Uncle Buck. Following action by the FCA, Uncle Buck went into administration
in March 2020 - and B&G Plc went into administration shortly afterwards. As a result, Mrs P
has not had her invested capital returned to her.
The application process
From the available evidence, it is not completely clear how Mrs Ps application was made.
She recalls speaking to a relationship manager at BG Ltd when completing the application.
This is supported by the available telephone records.
I have seen screen prints of each stage of BG Ltds online application process. These show
the online application journey that potential investors underwent. This consisted of two
stages, designed to meet the rules restricting who the bonds could be promoted to and on
how to test whether the investments were appropriate for the potential investor. The first was
certification. The second was the appropriateness test.
Galliums response to the complaint
Gallium did not uphold Mrs Ps complaint. It said Mrs P had been given sufficient information
and risk warnings about the investment. It then made further submissions, once Mrs Ps
complaint was referred to us. I have considered the submissions in full.
I have also considered what Gallium describes as its position statement, which sets out
general information on the background to complaints about B&G Plc bonds.
Our investigators view
One of our investigators considered Mrs Ps complaint and concluded it should be upheld.
They said, in summary:
The application process  both in terms of the certification of Mrs P as a restricted 
investor and the assessment of the appropriateness of the bond for her  was 
misleading and didnt gather sufficient information to comply with the FCAs rules.
Overall, BG Ltd, on Galliums behalf, didnt comply with its regulatory obligations. 
Had it done so, Mrs P wouldnt have decided to invest or BG Ltd should have 
concluded that it shouldnt allow Mrs P to invest. For these reasons, both 
cumulatively and individually, it was fair to uphold the complaint and for Gallium to 
compensate Mrs P for the loss she has suffered.
Galliums response to the view
Gallium did not accept the investigators view. It said, in summary:The acts the complaint is about took place after B&G Finance Ltd  an independent 
business with which Gallium had no relationship - became authorised. Once B&G 
Finance Ltd became authorised it took over from BG Ltd and so B&G Finance Ltd is 
responsible during this interim period, not Gallium.
Our findings went beyond the scope of Mrs Ps complaint.
Regardless of label, Mrs P was required to confirm that he met the requirements of a 
restricted investor and confirmed that she did. It is not fair or reasonable to conclude 
that the use of the word everyday contributed to Mrs P giving an incorrect 
declaration, and it was reasonable for it to rely on the declaration.
The appropriateness test answers, and these confirmations were sufficient for 
Gallium to satisfy itself that prospective investors had sufficient knowledge and 
experience of the bonds to understand the risks those bonds involved, as per the 
relevant rules.
It was reasonable for Gallium to rely on the outcome of this test..
The investigator provided evidence to Gallium that supported that BG Ltd were involved in
the arranging of investments during the interim period. They sent copies of correspondence
from other cases we have reviewed that showed emails and paperwork in use at the time
consistently set out prior to 1 March 2018 that they belonged to BG Ltd as an appointed
representative of Gallium Fund Solutions Limited. The investigator remained of the view the
evidence shows BG Ltd promoted and arranged the B&G bond Mrs P took out on in
February 2018, and Gallium was responsible for the actions of BG Ltd here.
Gallium has provided a witness statement from its former director, dated 16 February 2023
on subject of who is responsible for arranging the investment, which says:
He understands that the only regulated activities that continued to be carried out by 
BG Ltd in the interim period, were that BG Ltd remained responsible for the making 
of telephone calls with investors or prospective investors concerning their bond 
investments.
It is his understanding that in relation to telephone calls between Basset & Gold 
representatives and investors/prospective investors in the bonds, during the interim 
period all regulated activities relating to the financial promotions concerning the B&G 
Plc bonds, as well as activities concerning the arranging of bond investments, were 
conducted by BGF - BG Ltd continued to be responsible for the content of telephone 
calls between Basset & Gold.
On 4 January 2018, he received an email from the owner of Basset & Gold, which 
confirmed that Basset & Gold (he says this meant BGF) had been authorised by the 
FCA. The owner requested a meeting to discuss the best way to transition the 
regulatory business away from Gallium to the new firm.
He believes the meeting took place on 11 January 2018. No notes are available but 
he recalls what was discussed.
Gallium also provided a general submission which contained some further evidence
relating to what it describes as the interim period. This included:
A copy of the 4 January 2018 email from the owner of Basset & Gold referred to in 
the witness statement.
Copies of Galliums Appointed Representative Monthly Compliance Report for 
Basset Gold, for each month from February 2017 to February 2018.
Copies of the documents applying to terminate BG Ltd as Galliums appointed 
representative, submitted by Gallium to the FCA on 1 March 2018, and some 
associated emails.Some email correspondence between Gallium and BG Ltds compliance officer about 
B&G Plc becoming an appointed representative of BGF, and the transfer of approved 
persons.
A list of calls made by B&G Ltd which Gallium had monitored, month on month.
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in August 2023. I include a copy below:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given what Gallium says about the interim period  that it is not responsible for the act(s)
this complaint relates to - I have first considered all the available evidence and arguments to
decide whether we can consider Mrs Ps complaint.
It is not clear how exactly Mrs Ps applications came about  whether it was done online,
over the phone or through the post  or on what basis it proceeded. Ill consider this further
later in this provisional decision. But, for now, it is sufficient to say Mrs Ps complaint is about
the arrangement of her investment in the bonds and the exchanges she had with the
representative in the period up to the arrangement of the investments being concluded. In
short Mrs P says she was misled during those exchanges.
Rule DISP 2.3.1R says we can:
consider a complaint under the Compulsory Jurisdiction if it relates to an act or
omission by a firm in carrying onregulated activitiesor any ancillary activities,
including advice, carried on by the firm in connection with them.
And the guidance at DISP 2.3.3G says:
complaints about acts or omissions include those in respect of activities for which
the firmis responsible (including business of any appointed representative or agent
for which the firmhas accepted responsibility).
This guidance is drawn from the relevant legislation, which is paragraph 3 of s39 to the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMSA):
the principal [here, Gallium] of an appointed representative is responsible, to the
same extent as if he had expressly permitted it, for anything done or omitted by the
representative in carrying on the business for which he has accepted responsibility.
So I need to consider whether Mrs Ps complaint is about a regulated activity, carried on by
an appointed representative of Gallium, for which Gallium accepted responsibility.
Is Mrs Ps complaint about a regulated activity?
I am satisfied Mrs Ps complaint relates to a regulated activity. The bonds were a security or
contractually based investment specified in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (RAO). At the time Mrs P made her investments, the
RAO said regulated activities include arranging deals in investments. Acts such as obtaining
and assisting in the completion of an application form and sending it off, with the clients
payment, to the investment issuer would come within the scope of Article 25(1), when thearrangements have the direct effect of bringing about the transaction.
So I am satisfied the application process  whether it took place online or over the phone 
falls within the scope of Article 25(1). It involved making arrangements for Mrs P to invest in
the bonds, and had the direct effect of bringing about the transactions.
Was Gallium responsible for the acts the complaint is about?
Under the appointed representative agreement in place between BG Ltd and Gallium, in
relation to bonds, BG Ltd was allowed to carry out promoting activitieswhere the Company
has approved the financial promotion. And Gallium allowed BG Ltd the right under its
authorisation with the FCA to give advice in connection with advising, arranging, or dealing
in investment products for present and prospective clients and in connection therewith to
display, advertise, promote, . for the sole purpose of promoting the sale of the same.
This agreement was in force during the period up to the date of Mrs Ps later investment  2
February 2018. So, if BG Ltd carried out the arrangements, that is business for which
Gallium accepted responsibility and the complaint can therefore be considered against it.
I note Gallium, says from 2 January 2018 BGF began to promote the bonds to investors and
that the website and telephone line was the responsibility of BGF from that date. However 
save for the witness statement, which is unclear on several points and in any event
inconsistent with the position set out in response to the view  it has provided no evidence to
support this point. Mrs Ps first bond was taken out in September 2017 and so its clear that
Gallium is responsible for this. So I will focus on whether Gallium is also responsible for Mrs
Ps subsequent investment made in February 2018.
I will turn to the witness statement shortly. The evidence available otherwise all shows it was
BG Ltd  not BGF  which made the arrangements in this case. The evidence available
otherwise all shows it was BG Ltd  not BGF  which made the arrangements in this case.
Ive paid particular attention to the February 2018 Appointed Representative Monthly
Compliance Report which Gallium provided. The following questions are asked of Basset
Gold:
Does the Appointed Representative stationery (including website) properly identify
the firm as an Appointed Representative of Gallium Fund Solutions Limited? And
have you provided copies to Gallium?
Have you attached a list of all investors you have promoted to this month? Have all
investors been categorised as appropriate to receive the financial promotions prior to
promotion and such categories kept on file?
Each of these questions was answered Yes.
Attached to the February 2018 Appointed Representative Monthly Compliance Report is a
report all the investment business undertaken that month  which includes Mrs Ps 2
February 2018 investment.
Although the report refers to Basset Gold and not specifically to either of the appointed
representative businesses it clearly relates  at least insofar as what I refer to above - to the
activities of B&G Ltd, as it was B&G Ltd  not B&G Plc  which operated the website, made
promotions and arranged investments.
Gallium also provided a copy of the January 2018 Appointed Representative Monthly
Compliance Report which features a post-it note stuck to it, which says:Pls note the total of money raised for B&G for Series 6 & 7/ They may need to
consider new loan documents soon. Although probably will not be our issue as
terminating end of Feb, but worth mentioning to them
This suggests that Mrs Ps investment was made prior to the termination date at the end of
February 2018.
Mrs P says she dealt with a Relationship Manager helping her through the application on the
phone. While the full history of call recordings arent available, from what I have been able to
listen to, it is apparent that Mrs P has an existing relationship with the person they were
dealing with and they were quite familiar with each other.
If the Relationship Manager was no longer working on behalf of BG Ltd, and after 2 January
2018 and was instead working for BGF, I would have expected this to be explained. I say
this given Mrs Ps interactions with BG Ltd were ongoing at that point. But Ive not seen
evidence this happened, in fact to the contrary it seems more likely the Relationship
Manager was still working on behalf of BG Ltd.
In addition to this, through other complaints this service has adjudicated on, we have seen
numerous examples of bond sales that link BG Ltd to arranging investments during the
interim period. We have seen evidence in the form of emails and telephone calls that
indicate that investors were dealing with representatives of BG Ltd when arranging bonds
around the time period when Mrs P took out her investment. For example, weve seen
several emails from January 2018 sent to investors from BG Ltd Relationship Managers and
the email footer states, Basset Gold Ltd is an appointed representative of Gallium Fund
Solutions Limited which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Gallium says the available evidence suggests that Mrs P applied to invest through a website
process approved by BGF. But I have not seen any evidence of the type Gallium refers to.
As I have set out, I have not seen any evidence specific to this investment which makes any
reference to BGF- all references are to BG Ltd.
Returning to the witness statement - this includes the following:
On 4 January 2018, I received an email from [name of the owner of the Basset
Gold/Basset and Gold businesses], the ultimate owner and controller of Basset &
Gold, which confirmed that Basset & Gold had been authorised by the FCA. I now
know that it is BGF that was the entity authorised by the FCA, and that BGF had
become FCA authorised on 2 January 2018. [name of the owner of the Basset
Gold/Basset and Gold businesses] requested a meeting to discuss the best way to
transition the regulatory business away from Gallium to the new firm.
I met with [name of the owner of the Basset Gold/Basset and Gold businesses] in the
hotel he was staying in London the week following his email. I believe the meeting
took place on 11 January 2018 as [name of the owner of the Basset Gold/Basset and
Gold businesses]s email of 4 January 2018 mentioned that he would be in London
the following Thursday, which was the 11th. I recall that I made a note of what we
discussed at the meeting, but so long after it took place I cannot now locate my
notes. I do, however, recall what was discussed.
At the meeting, [name of the owner of the Basset Gold/Basset and Gold businesses]
and I agreed that Gallium would cease monitoring and approving new financial
promotions with immediate effect, because Basset & Gold now controlled its own
regulated firm, BGF. [name of the owner of the Basset Gold/Basset and Gold
businesses] also informed me that BGF would update the Basset & Gold website and
online application form, to reflect that BGF was now responsible for the promotion ofthe bonds and arranging any investments made in the Bonds.
There are a number of things about the witness statement which are unclear. But, even I
accept what the statement says as an accurate reflection of the position at the time (and, to
be clear, given the available evidence otherwise, I do not) it does not in any event amount to
evidence BGF was responsible for Mrs Ps investment.
I say this because the witness statement says a meeting  to discuss a transition to BGF
from Galliums appointed representatives  took place on 11 January. Galliums ex-director
says his recollection of that meeting was that at the time of the meeting Gallium would no
longer be responsible with immediate effect and BGF now being responsible. Which
suggests, on Galliums ex-directors recollection, responsibility passed from Gallium to BGF
on 11 January 2018. That is contradictory to previous statements that BGF were responsible
from 2 January 2018, so casts doubt over the statements made.
Ive considered the latest general submissions Gallium has presented to support its view that
it isnt responsible for answering Mrs Ps complaint. In my view this is all evidence B&G Ltd
was arranging investments in B&G Plc bonds  including the investment Mrs P made  at
the time of this investment, and was doing so as an appointed representative of Gallium. I
say this because:
The 4 January 2018 email only refers to an intention to transition away from Gallium 
to BGF, and makes a request to discuss how this might be done. It is not evidence of 
a transition to BGF having already taken place, and of BGF hence being responsible 
from that time.
The Appointed Representative Monthly Compliance Report is evidence B&G Ltd was 
still being described as an appointed representative of Gallium at this time, in 
stationery and on the website. It is also evidence Gallium was monitoring and 
recording promotions and arrangements being made by B&G Ltd at that time. This is 
strong evidence Gallium accepted responsibility for the arrangement of investments 
at the time.
The post-it note on the investment list is clear evidence Gallium understood it was 
responsible for the arrangement of investments until 1 March 2018.
The fact Gallium was monitoring calls from B&G Ltd to investors (or potential 
investors) is further strong evidence Gallium accepted responsibility for the 
arrangement of investments at the time  there is no other reason why such 
monitoring would be taking place.
To be clear, I have not seen any evidence to show BGF took responsibility from 2 January
2018, as Gallium response to the investigators view says, or that it had any involvement in
Mrs Ps investment. All the evidence I have seen supports a contrary position. Im satisfied
Mrs Ps complaint is about acts for which Gallium accepted responsibility. They are therefore
acts of Gallium and can be considered in a complaint against it.
The merits of Mrs Ps complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint, I have
taken into account relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards;
codes of practice; and where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry
practice at the relevant time.The Principles for Businesses, which are set out in the FCAs Handbook are a general
statement of the fundamental obligations of firms under the regulatory system (PRIN
1.1.2G). I think Principles 6 (Customers interests) and 7 (Communications with clients) are
relevant here.
Principle 7 overlaps with COBS 4.2.1R (1) (A firm must ensure that a communication or a
financial promotion is fair, clear and not misleading), which I also consider to be relevant
here.
The bonds were non-readily realisable and therefore there were rules restricting who they
could be promoted to and how to test whether the investment was appropriate for the
potential investor. These rules were set out in COBS 4.7 and COBS 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3. I
have considered the relevant rules in full.
I note Gallium has referred to the FCAs policy statement PS14/4, and to question and
answer sessions with the FCAs Head of Investment Policy and UKCFA. I have considered
these too.
Having considered all the available evidence and arguments I have reached similar overall
conclusions to the investigator, for similar reasons. In summary:
BG Ltd, acting on Galliums behalf, misled Mrs P into certifying herself as belonging 
in a category to which she did not belong (a restricted investor) by changing the 
term used in the rules to everyday investor and describing the category as being 
one anyone could fall into. This was not treating Mrs P fairly or acting in her best 
interests. Had BG Ltd followed the rules and not misled Mrs P, it is unlikely she would 
have certified herself as being a restricted investor.
The appropriateness test carried out by BG Ltd, on behalf of Gallium, did not meet 
the requirements of the rules. And, had it done so, it would have been apparent the 
bond was not an appropriate investment for Mrs P. In the circumstances she would 
either not have proceeded or, acting fairly and reasonably, BG Ltd should have 
concluded it should not promote the bond to her.
For these reasons  individually and cumulatively  my decision is that Mrs Ps complaint
should be upheld. I am also satisfied Mrs P would either not have proceeded to make the
investment or would not have been able to proceed, had Gallium acted fairly and reasonably
to meet its regulatory obligations. And so I am satisfied it is fair to ask Gallium to
compensate Mrs P for her loss.
Responses to the provisional decision
RateSetter didnt provide a response by the deadline given and Mrs P accepted the 
provisional findings. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.As no further comments have been provided in response to my provisional findings, Ive no 
reason to vary from my original findings.
Putting things right
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider that my aim should be to put Mrs
P as close to the position she would probably now be in if she had not invested in the bonds.
I take the view that Mrs P would have invested differently. It is not possible to say precisely
what she would have done differently. But I am satisfied that what I have set out below is fair
and reasonable given Mrs P's circumstances and objectives when she invested.
What must Gallium do?
To compensate Mrs P fairly, Gallium must:
Compare the performance of Mrs P's investment with that of the benchmark shown 
below and pay the difference between the fair value and the actual value of the 
investments. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is 
payable.
Pay Mrs P Â£250 for the distress caused. This recognises the worry that she felt when 
B&G failed and given her age and circumstances.
Gallium should also add any interest set out below to the compensation payable
Provide the details of the calculation to Mrs P in a clear, simple format.
Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded.

This means the actual amount paid or payable from the investment at the end date.
If at the end date the investment is illiquid (meaning it could not be readily sold on the open 
market), it may be difficult to work out what the actual value is. In such a case the actual
value should be assumed to be zero. This is provided Mrs P agrees to Gallium taking
ownership of the investment, if it wishes to. If it is not possible for Gallium to take ownership,
then it may request an undertaking from Mrs P that she repays to Gallium any amount she
may receive from the investment in future.
Fair value
This is what the investment would have been worth at the end date had it produced a return
using the benchmark.
To arrive at the fair value when using the fixed rate bonds as the benchmark, Gallium should
use the monthly average rate for one-year fixed-rate bonds as published by the Bank of
England. The rate for each month is that shown as at the end of the previous month. Those
rates should be applied to the investment on an annually compounded basis.
Any withdrawal, income or other distributions paid out of the investment should be deducted
from the fair value calculation at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any
return in the calculation from that point on. If there are a large number of regular payments,
to keep calculations simpler, Ill accept if Gallium totals all those payments and deducts that
figure at the end to determine the fair value instead of deducting periodically. If any
distributions or income were automatically paid out into a portfolio and left uninvested, they
must be deducted at the end to determine the fair value, and not periodically.
Why is this remedy suitable?
I have decided on this method of compensation because:
Mrs P wanted to achieve a reasonable return without risking any of her capital.
The average rate for the fixed rate bonds would be a fair measure given Mrs P's 
circumstances and objectives. It does not mean that Mrs P would have invested only 
in a fixed rate bond. It is the sort of investment return a consumer could have 
obtained with little risk to their capital.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct Gallium Fund Solutions Limited to 
pay the amount calculated as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2023.
