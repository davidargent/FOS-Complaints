The complaint
Ms J complained that, despite following all the requirements set out by PayPal Europe Sarl &
Cie, SCA, she wasnt covered by seller protection when a successful chargeback was made
for a high-value item that she sold using PayPal.
  
What happened
Ms J complained that she sold a high-value item, and received payment of £1,350 through
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. She said the buyer tried to cancel the transaction as soon
as shed been notified the item was sent. Ms J said she couldnt cancel then.
Ms J told us the buyer then tried to claim the money back from PayPal, saying the item
wasnt as described. But PayPal closed the case in Ms Js favour, as shed shown shed
followed all the requirements for the transaction.
Then the buyer made a chargeback request, through PayPal.
Ms J said she had followed exactly what PayPal wanted her to do, but the money was still
taken from her, and then PayPal said she wasnt covered by sellers protection. Ms J said
she hadnt received the item back, and PayPal had passed her debt on to a debt collection
agent. The agent was calling her daily, asking for the money back, although PayPal still said
shed done everything she should, and the seller was in the wrong. And PayPal had also
stopped her from using her account.
Ms J wanted us to help.
PayPal said that Ms J sold an item for £1,350 on 7 November 2019, and was paid for this
through her PayPal account. The buyer opened a dispute on the auction site shed used for
the sale. PayPal has no details of the case, although it doesnt suggest that any payment
was reversed at this stage.
On 11 November, the buyer opened a dispute through PayPal, saying that the item was
incorrectly sized. PayPal said this was buyers remorse, and it wasnt covered under its
buyer protection policy, so it closed this case in Ms Js favour.
PayPal said that on 2 December, the buyer opened a chargeback with their card scheme
operator (whose symbol is shown on the buyers card) saying that the merchant refused to
accept returned merchandise.
PayPal said it had disputed this with the buyers card scheme operator straight away, and
forwarded all relevant details. But on 10 December, the card scheme operator decided this
in the buyers favour, and the money was then taken out of Ms Js account.
PayPal said that if a payment is refunded through a chargeback, and that chargeback is
because the item was Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) then the refund isnt covered
by its seller protection policy. So it had taken this money from Ms Js account, and it thought
she had to pay the resulting debt.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said that PayPal had turned
down the buyers claim, because it felt that this item wasnt SNAD, it was just a case of
buyers remorse. So if it wasnt SNAD after all, then Ms Js claim under seller protection
didnt fall under any of the exceptions to seller protection. If PayPal had rejected the buyers
complaint as a simple case of buyers remorse, then it should have upheld Ms Js claim for
the same reason.
Our investigator said that PayPal should refund Ms Js account with the full amount it debited
as a result of the chargeback the buyer made, and stop recovery action on this debt by it, or
the third party involved. It should also pay Ms J £100 in compensation.
Ms J agreed with this. But PayPal didnt. It said that our investigator was wrongly comparing
two different policies. PayPal said it had checked if the buyer met the requirements of SNAD
under its own buyer protection, and the buyer didnt meet the requirements. But then a
chargeback decision on whether the item was SNAD was made by the buyers card
operator, and this chargeback was successful. PayPal repeated that its seller protection
doesnt cover sellers for successful SNAD chargebacks. So it didnt think it had done
anything wrong.
PayPal wanted an ombudsman to look at the complaint, so this case came to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
A chargeback is a request for a refund, which is arbitrated by the card scheme 
operator, whose symbol is on the buyers card. PayPal isnt in charge of that scheme, 
and it doesnt make the decisions on whether a chargeback is successful or not.
PayPal told us that the buyer in this case had made a request for a chargeback, 
through her card scheme operator. That chargeback was successful, and PayPal 
said that because of the type of chargeback made, Ms J wasnt eligible for seller 
protection.
I can see that PayPals seller protection policy says this 
Your sale is not eligible for coverage under PayPal Seller Protection if:
 The buyer claims (either with us or their card issuer) that the item you sent
isn't what was ordered (referred to as a Significantly Not as Described 
claim).
So if a successful chargeback had been made, for SNAD, then I might have said that 
Ms J wasnt eligible for seller protection.
But when Ms J first complained to us, she mentioned a different reason for the 
chargeback. She said, in the complaint form that she originally sent us, that this 
chargeback was made because it was a recurring payment that [the buyer] had not 
authorised.
So, when this case came to me, I asked PayPal for some further information about 
the chargeback made, and how it had defended this.Ive looked at the information that PayPal has now sent us on this chargeback, and 
what PayPal says now does seem to me to be different to what it previously told our 
investigator. It now says that the chargeback was reported on 11 November 2019, 
and the reason given by the buyer for the chargeback was that they previously 
cancelled this recurring payment.
PayPal said it contacted the seller on 30 November, and received a response from 
her. It sent this to the card scheme operator. But then it said there was no further 
contact about this chargeback, it just received a final debit on 12 December.
PayPal had previously told us that a SNAD chargeback was raised on 2 December 
2019, and it responded to this on the same day, but this was decided in the buyers 
favour on 10 December.
I dont know if two separate chargebacks were actually raised. But the information in 
Ms Js complaint form makes me think that it was a chargeback for a previously 
cancelled recurring transaction that she was asked to comment on. And the 
screenshots that PayPal has sent us now, make me think that it was likely to have 
been a chargeback for a previously cancelled recurring payment, which was actually 
successful.
The relevant card scheme operators rules set out that a chargeback is possible for a
previously cancelled recurring payment, where 
The Cardholder withdrew permission to charge the account for a Recurring
Transaction or  an Installment Transaction.
So the buyer appears to have said that she had withdrawn permission for PayPal to 
debit the card used for this purchase, and shed done that before the transaction 
went through.
I would usually expect PayPal, when a chargeback is attempted, to ask the seller 
about why the chargeback shouldnt be successful, and to pass this information on to 
the card scheme operator, so it can make a decision about whether or not to approve 
the chargeback request.
And PayPal says thats what it did in this case.
But the information the card scheme operator needed in this case, unusually, wasnt
information from the seller. It was information only PayPal would have access to. The 
card scheme operator needed to know if the buyer really had withdrawn permission 
for PayPal to debit the card used here, before this sale went through. And I havent 
been able to see that PayPal has addressed this at all. I think it shouldve done so.
The chargeback was successful, and Ms Js account was debited for the full amount 
of this transaction. PayPal usually also charges a fee for a successful chargeback, it 
hasnt told us if it did so in this case.
Ms J then tried to make a claim under the PayPal seller protection. PayPal turned 
this down, apparently on the basis that the buyer had made a chargeback because 
the item was "Significantly Not as Described. And SNAD claims arent covered 
under its seller protection.
But Ive explained that I think it was more likely that any successful chargeback was 
actually for a previously cancelled recurring payment reason, not for SNAD. And PayPal has accepted that chargebacks for unauthorised transactions are covered by 
seller protection. So I think that Ms J ought to have been covered, under its seller 
protection policy.
For these reasons, I think that PayPal should refund to Ms J all the money it took for 
this chargeback, and any fees or charges it has applied to her account as a result of 
this. It should remove any restriction placed on her account as a result of this dispute. 
PayPal should, as part of this, notify the agents it has instructed to reclaim this debt, 
that it is no longer owed. And finally, PayPal should also pay Ms J £200 in 
compensation, for the distress that this complaint and in particular the pursuit of 
money Im persuaded that she didnt really owe, has caused to her.
PayPal must also ensure that Ms Js credit file has not been adversely affected by 
this chargeback and the resulting debt.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied to accept my decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must do the following 
- refund to Ms Js account all the money it took for this chargeback, and any fees or 
charges it has applied to her account as a result of this,
- remove any restriction placed on her account as a result of this dispute,
- ensure that Ms Js credit file has not been adversely affected by this chargeback 
and the resulting debt,
- notify the agents it has instructed, that this debt is no longer owed, and
- pay Ms J £200 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2021.
