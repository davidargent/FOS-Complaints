K821x#15complaint
Miss P has complained  about  a number of loans she took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss P says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Miss P took out some 20 instalment loans from Sunny between  
September 2015 and February  2018.  Ive enclosed a summary of Miss Ps borrowing with 
Sunny, based  on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end 
of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  initially said it hadnt  done anything wrong. 
But later it made an offer to settle  the complaint from the point of loan 12 onwards. Miss P 
didnt reply to us about this so the complaint  has been passed to me for an ombudsmans 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Ps 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss P 
could repay  all the loans she was given  in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN83149222refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss P could sustainably repay the loans;  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss P could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss P. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of lending history  
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of Miss 
Ps declared  income  at around  the time. Ive also looked at what she said about her monthly 
expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  5. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Miss P, would have made those  particular loans 
appear affordable.  
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Miss P should have caused 
it to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point 
onwards. 
This is because this was Miss Ps sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in under 10 
months. And in common with her borrowing pattern thus far, she was again asking to borrow  
from Sunny  whilst previous loans  remained  outstanding. It was also apparent that she wasnt  
making any in-roads into her debt because the loan amount was increasing again.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised that Miss P wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term 
cash-flow problems; she was borrowing very regularly,  to address shortfalls in her income 
and to meet an ongoing need.  Miss P was having to consistently take out high interest, 
short-term lending over a sustained period and the indebtedness caused by this type of 
borrowing was harmful, in my view. Sunny should have seen this and realised Miss P was at 
risk of not managing to repay the loans  sustainably or getting into financial difficulties. 
Ref: DRN83149223So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 20. Sunny repeatedly lent to Miss P in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss P borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss P paid on loans 6 - 20;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 17, 18, 19 and 20 and 
treat any payments  Miss P made  towards  these loans as payments towards  the 
capital;
if reworking Miss Ps loans 17, 18, 19 and 20 accounts as Ive directed results  in her 
effectively having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny 
should refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  interest  calculated  on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of 
settlement. 
If reworking Miss Ps loans 17, 18, 19 and 20 accounts leaves an amount of capital 
still to be paid,  then Sunny  can use the total refund  for the other upheld loans to 
offset this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I would remind  
Sunny that it should take a sympathetic view when  seeking  to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Miss P for the remaining capital.
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 -20 should be completely 
removed from Miss Ps credit  file.
If Sunny has sold any of the outstanding  debt it should buy it back  and then take the 
above steps. If it is not able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the results outlined  above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss P a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Miss Ps complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right for Miss P as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 March  2020.
