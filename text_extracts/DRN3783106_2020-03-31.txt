Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ps complaint in part and thought loans  5 to 32 should not have 
been given. Sunny didnt  agree in full but made  an offer from loan 11 onwards. The 
complaint has now been  passed  to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN37831062the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Mr P hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loans  1 to 4 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ps other lending. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 5 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr P was having some trouble in managing his money. By the time loan 5 was taken,   
Mr P was paying for three other loans (loans  2 to 4) with Sunny at the same time.  Loan 5 
was taken in very quick succession after the first three loans in the second  chain of lending 
and only a month after loan 2 was taken. While the amounts  fluctuated, Sunny should have 
been concerned  with Mr Ps borrowing pattern by the time loan 5 was taken and should have 
realised that he was having problems  managing  money. 
So Sunny should not have given Mr P loan 5 and subsequently not have given Mr P loans 6 
to 10 either.  
Sunny has already agreed to make  an offer from loan 11 and has said it will amend Mr Ps 
credit file accordingly, so I dont  need  to consider any further loans in my decision. 
Ref: DRN37831063putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on 5 to 32;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 to 11 from Mr Ps credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 12 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 12 to 32 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
