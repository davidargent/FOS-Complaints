Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  treated him unfairly by 
closing his two personal current accounts  and his savings account.
background
On 19 March 2019, NatWest sent a letter to Mr B. The letter listed his two current  accounts 
held solely  in his name, his savings account  and another account held jointly  with his 
partner. The letter went on to say:
We, National Westminster Bank  Plc, have recently  undertaken  a review of the 
banking arrangements that you have  with us. We have, with regret, reached the 
conclusion that we will no longer provide these facilities  for you.
Consequently, you will need  to make alternative  banking arrangements within  
60 days of the date of this letter.  These arrangements  must be outside  of 
The Royal Bank of Scotland  Group  plc, which includes National Westminster  Bank  
Plc...
We assure you that we have only reached this decision after careful consideration, 
however, our decision is final and we are not prepared to enter into any discussion in 
relation to it.
Around a week  later, Mr B called NatWest. He said Ive received, me and my partner have 
received, letters from yourselves shutting all accounts down including [another] account 
within 60 days. The person  Mr B spoke to explained NatWest doesnt  have to give a reason, 
but he could appeal the banks decision to close his account. During  this call, NatWest  asked  
for details  of the accounts and Mr B said Ill just choose one of these ones that are on the 
letter. Ill give you [the number of one of my current accounts]. 
Mr B complained to NatWest, wanting  to know the reason for the account closures, saying 
the account closure was unfair   he said that whilst he and his partner are gamblers, its 
above board. He thought  NatWests decision  was discriminatory. NatWest reiterated its not 
required to provide a reason for its decision to close his accounts.  
In its final response to the complaint,  NatWest  said the banks decision to close  his accounts 
was in line with its terms and conditions. Unhappy with this response, Mr B referred his 
complaint to our service. 
One of our investigators  reviewed Mr Bs complaint but didnt uphold it. The investigator was 
satisfied NatWest wrote to Mr B on 19 March  2019  giving him notice his accounts would be 
closed. Our investigator  didnt think there  was any evidence of discrimination in NatWests  
decision to close Mr Bs account. The investigator said the terms and conditions of Mr Bs 
accounts allowed  NatWest to close these with 60 days notice. 
Mr B didnt agree, saying  he didnt receive NatWests letters about his personal  accounts. He 
asked for an ombudsman to review  his complaint. 
Ref: DRN35547032my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions  of Mr Bs current and savings accounts  set out that NatWest  can 
close these accounts  by giving at least 60 days notice. Im satisfied  that on 19 March  2019, 
NatWest gave 60 days notice of its intention to close Mr Bs account. And having listened to 
Mr Bs calls with NatWest,  I think its likely  he received NatWests letter of 19 March 2019 
and was aware NatWest  had given him 60 days notice of its intention to close  his accounts.  
Mr B wants  to know why NatWest decided to close his accounts and believe its decision is 
related to his gambling. The terms of Mr Bs account dont require NatWest to disclose  the 
reason for its decision so I cant say it was obliged to tell Mr B why it decided  to close  his 
accounts. On a call to NatWest, I did hear Mr B explain his suspicions about  why NatWest 
decided to close his account, but I dont think NatWest said it decided to close  Mr Bs 
account because  he gambles.
Whilst I appreciate Mr B is disappointed  with NatWests decision,  I think  it was entitled to 
give  and did give him  60 days notice of its intention to close  his sole accounts. 
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 December  2019.
