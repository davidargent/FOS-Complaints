The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has refused to help him 
following a payment to an incorrect account.
What happened
Mr S made a payment of £1,000 to what he thought was an account he held with a bank I 
will call B in April 2022. The account number had been re-cycled by B. Mr S says he asked 
NatWest to help him recover the money, but it appears the recipient of the money withdrew 
it. He says B made a mistake which it now accepts, and B has said NatWest should now 
make an indemnity claim which it will honour. B has also said it has given NatWest the name 
of its customer which Mr S can use for legal proceedings. Mr S would like those details and 
for NatWest to at least try and make a new indemnity claim.
NatWest says B didnt respond to its requests for a return of the money and says it had been 
withdrawn. It says it made two requests of B and Mr S will have to ask it for the customer 
details. NatWest accepts it didnt deal with parts of Mr Ss complaint appropriately and has 
paid £75 compensation.
Mr S brought his complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest had tried to retrieve the money, but B had rejected the attempts due to 
there not being enough money in the beneficiarys account. The investigator thought 
NatWest had the beneficiarys details, but we couldnt provide them directly to Mr S.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says he has a letter from B in which it says it will honour 
any indemnity claim NatWest will now make. He also says NatWest has not provided him 
with the beneficiarys details despite asking for them.
I asked NatWest to look at Bs letter and to ask it if it was prepared to follow Bs 
recommendation. I also asked NatWest to confirm if it had provided Mr S with the 
beneficiaries details.
NatWest says it will not make a further indemnity claim and says Mr S should deal directly 
with the beneficiary as it has done all it can.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said as follows. I came to the 
provisional view that NatWest hadnt acted fairly here and hadnt done what I would have 
expected to have helped Mr S recover his money.
I said there was no dispute here that Mr S made a mistake in transferring the money to the 
wrong account. And that is something that banks and building societies are familiar with and 
are required to assist a customer in those circumstances. I explained there was no 
guarantee of a successful outcome, something I was sure Mr S understood.
I was satisfied that NatWest did try and help Mr S by making a request to B to have the 
money returned. I thought it likely that B was at fault at that stage as it appears to have paid 
Mr S £100 compensation for not dealing with NatWests request appropriately. I could see 
that in August 2022 B told Mr S that if NatWest made a further indemnity claim that it would 
honour that attempt.  That letter was sometime after NatWest made the initial request.
I didnt think it clear why in those circumstances NatWest refused to make such a further 
request. I appreciated Mr Ss frustrations as it would not be an onerous task to make such a 
request when B had made clear why NatWest should do so. I didnt think NatWest had 
explained why it would not make that request when it was clearly in Mr Ss interests that it 
did so. I said it follows that if B rejected that indemnity claim that NatWest couldnt be 
responsible for such a decision. I appreciated NatWest says it made such requests, but they 
were rejected. But I was satisfied that position had changed following Bs letter which 
NatWest has a copy of.
I could see that all Mr S wanted to resolve this complaint was for NatWest to at least make a 
new attempt to retrieve his £1,000 and provide him with the beneficiarys details so he could 
consider legal action. I was satisfied that B had provided NatWest with those details and had 
explained they can be provided to Mr S for the restricted purpose of legal proceedings via a 
solicitor. Again, I didnt think it clear why NatWest couldnt simply provide those details to Mr 
S whilst explaining the restrictions involved in providing them. I also didnt think it clear why 
NatWest says B should provide them to Mr S when B had provided them to it. I didnt think 
Mr S was able to receive the details from B as his business relationship was with NatWest.
Overall, I was satisfied that whilst NatWest may have acted fairly and tried to help Mr S 
when the mistake was first made, it had not done so following Bs letter or in providing the 
beneficiarys details to him. I had no doubt Mr S had been caused distress and 
inconvenience in trying to resolve matters. I didnt think Mr S had suffered any direct or 
additional financial loss as a result of NatWests lack of action but thought he should be paid 
£100 compensation for what had taken place. I appreciated compensation was not what Mr 
S wanted. I also didnt think it clear why NatWest paid £75 compensation or what that 
specifically related to. 
I hoped before my final decision NatWest confirmed what the compensation was paid for.
Mr S has replied to my provisional decision and says there is no incentive for NatWest to 
deal with the indemnity process. He suggests one solution would be for it to pay him the 
disputed money.
NatWest has not replied to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I reached in my provisional decision and 
for the same reasons. 
I appreciate why Mr S suggests that NatWest refund the disputed payment but as he is 
aware we are not NatWests regulator and so its not our role to punish it.
I make clear to Mr S that I require NatWest to make a further indemnity claim but the 
decision to refund the money can only be made by B.Putting things right
NatWest should pay Mr S a further £100 compensation and provide the beneficiaries details 
in the usual restricted format. It should also carry out the indemnity as recommended by B.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Mr S £100 compensation, make a further indemnity claim and provide him with the 
beneficiarys details for the purpose of legal proceedings via a solicitor.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2023.
