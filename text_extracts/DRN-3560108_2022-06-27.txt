The complaint
Ms P says Madison CF Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
This complaint is about three fixed term loans taken out by Ms P between March 2016 and 
June 2018 with 118 118 Money. The details of these loans are:
Loan Amount Date Months Repayment
1 £1000.00 01/03/2016 24 £79.31
2 £1353.40 30/10/2017 24 £107.71
3 £1812.77 16/06/2018 24 £140.13
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2022. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
Were the checks that 118 118 Money carried out for loan 1 proportionate? And did it make 
a fair lending decision?
118 118 Money says it carried out proportionate checks when it agreed to loan 1. It said Ms 
P completed an income and expenditure declaration online. It says it then carried out a credit 
check and verified her income. It says it calculated that 25% of Ms Ps verified income would 
be used as her living expenses or what she declared, whatever was the highest amount. 
I can see that it assessed the loan as affordable based on its checks. I have looked through 
the credit search results and can see that Ms P had defaulted on 4 accounts listed on this 
search. At first glance this would all indicate that Ms P was struggling financially. But I can 
see that she had settled all 4 accounts, and 3 of these had defaulted around a year or more 
before she came to 118 118 Money to ask for loan 1. In addition, Ms P had 5 active 
accounts and her overall indebtedness was relatively small. She had around £570 in 
unsecured debt. This was spread across 2 credit cards and a loan. The loan appeared to be 
in arrears at one stage, but Ms P had repaid what she owed and this loan seemed to be 
back on track with repayments. So, I dont think 118 118 Money ought to have had too many 
concerns about what it had gathered on Ms Ps credit file at this stage. 
I think when I look at what 118 118 Money gathered and consider this alongside the fact that 
this was the first loan that Ms P had taken out with it, I think the checks it carried out in this 
instance were, on balance, proportionate and reasonable. I am also currently minded to 
conclude it then went on to make a fair lending decision based on what it had in front of it. It 
had calculated that Ms P had enough disposable income to afford the repayments of the 
loan.
Were the checks that 118 118 Money carried out for loans 2 and 3 reasonable and 
proportionate?
I can see 118 118 Money carried out similar checks for loans 2 and 3. 
There was an increase in the amount of unsecured lending that Ms P had taken out from 
when she had taken out loan 1 to her asking for loan 2. Her outstanding credit commitments 
had increased from around £570 to around £1650. Ms P had 2 loan accounts (albeit one 
was with it), 2 credit card accounts and 2 bank accounts. Of concern though was a fifth 
defaulted account. This was from a credit card and Ms P had defaulted on this account in 
September 2016, around 6 months after she took out loan 1. I think this ought to have given 
118 118 Money concerns about Ms Ps finances, at least enough that it wouldve wanted to 
conduct more in-depth checks to assure itself that she could sustainably repay the second 
loan over the extended terms. Ms P defaulted on this account after it had given her credit, 
and I think this should have been enough for it to want to conduct a complete review of her 
finances before lending to her again. 
When Ms P asked for loan 3, 118 118 Money would have seen that her overall unsecured 
lending had increased from £1659 to £4102. When I think about what I have already 
concluded with loan 2, Ms Ps overall indebtedness rising and also the amount she was 
refinancing, the total cost and length of the loan (2 years), I think 118 118 Money should 
have carried out a complete review of her finances to see whether the loan repayments were 
sustainable over the life of loan 3, this would include verifying her expenditure in more detail. 
As I cant see that this 118 118 Money did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out 
before providing Ms P with loans 2 and 3 were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to 118 118 Money that Ms P 
would have been unable to repay loans 2 and 3?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before loans 2 and 3 were 
provided, I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So, I need to decide whether it is 
more likely than not that a proportionate check would have told 118 118 Money that Ms P 
would have been unable to sustainably repay loans 2 and 3.
Ms P has provided bank statements to our service from a period of time leading up to when 
the loans were granted, and Ive carefully considered the information provided. I have looked 
at the 2 months leading up to Ms P asking for loan 2 this being in September and October 
2017. Having looked through these statements, I can see that Ms P was repaying two short 
term lenders on a regular basis along with payments to and from a revolving credit facility. In 
September she made £695 in short term credit payments and in October £1366. These 
loans did not appear in Ms Ps credit file. In addition to this she paid unplanned overdraft 
fees of £80 a month and also paid charges for returned direct debits.  
When I scrutinise the statements further, I can see that Ms P needed the short-term loans to 
meet her monthly expenditure. I am currently minded to conclude, after seeing this, that Ms 
P was reliant on short term lending to fill a gap in her finances when she applied for loan 2.
I have also looked at the bank statements for the 3 months leading up to Ms P taking out 
loan 3. I can see that she was still using a revolving credit facility and had additional charges 
to repay. Im minded to conclude that Ive seen enough in these statements that show Ms 
Ps finances hadnt improved from when she took out loan 2.  
Bearing all this in mind, Im currently minded to conclude that reasonable and proportionate 
checks would more likely than not have shown 118 118 Money that Ms P would not have 
been able to repay loans 2 and 3 in a sustainable manner. The information she has provided 
shows she was having problems managing her finances. On balance, I think it would have 
become apparent to 118 118 Money that the loan repayments for both loans wouldnt have been sustainable. So, Im satisfied that its failure to carry out proportionate checks resulted 
in it unfairly providing loans 2 and 3 to Ms P.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response 
to my provisional decision. Both parties have responded and both have accepted the 
findings in my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties have nothing further to add and have accepted the findings given in my 
provisional decision, there is no reason for me to change the outcome. With that being the 
case, I uphold Ms Ps complaint about loans 2 and 3 and it is now time for 118 118 Money to 
put things right.
Putting things right  what 118 118 Money needs to do
refund all interest and charges Ms P paid on loans 2 and 3;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 2 and 3 from Ms Ps credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 Money 
must give Ms P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ps complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as I have described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2022.
