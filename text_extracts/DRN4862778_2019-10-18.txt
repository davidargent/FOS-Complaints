Mr A says if Sunny had carried out better checks before lending to him, it would have  
declined his applications. He says hes been bankrupt  in the past and he was unable  to pay 
priority bills due to the large repayments.  He says hes in a cycle  of borrowing and he has 
multiple other debts.
Sunny says it carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks  before approving  each of 
the loans. It says it considered the checks were  proportionate and the lending was 
responsible at the time.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He said that, by loan 5, it 
was likely proportionate checks would have shown Mr A was having problems managing his 
money. He added that Mr As borrowing pattern suggested he had become reliant on short-
term loans by loan 6. Our adjudicator recommended interest and charges  (plus 8% statutory 
interest) should be refunded on loans 5 to 19 and that adverse information  about loan 5 
should be removed  from his credit file. He also said that loans 6 to 19 should be removed 
from Mr As credit  file entirely.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that Mr As scheduled repayments were always a 
small proportion  of his income so could not agree they were unaffordable. It added  that it 
believed its checks were  robust enough regarding Mr As other short-term credit 
commitments.
Ref: DRN48627782my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers credit record and income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors would 
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it is likely to be more  difficult to 
make any loan repayments towards  a given loan amount from a lower  level of 
income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Ref: DRN48627783Loans 1 to 4
I can see Sunny asked Mr A for information about  his income and expenditure at the time he 
applied for his first four loans. This showed  the repayments were affordable and there was 
nothing to indicate Mr A wouldnt be able to sustainably repay the loans.  As all the loans 
were repaid  early, I cant conclude Sunny was wrong to approve any of these initial loans.
Loan 5
As this was Mr As fifth loan application in less than three months, and loan 4 was still 
outstanding at the time, I consider a proportionate check  should have included a full financial 
review of Mr As circumstances. Had Sunny carried out such a check, its likely it would have 
found Mr A had at least two other  outstanding short-term loans with other  providers, as well 
as the outstanding Sunny loan. This indicates  its likely Mr A was having trouble managing 
his money and so Im not satisfied it was responsible for Sunny to have approved loan 5.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
Mr A hadnt repaid  any of his existing short-term  loans,  either  with Sunny or other 
lenders, in the time between his applications for loans 5 and 6. This meant his total 
monthly repayments to Sunny  were  the highest  theyd  been. It was also his sixth loan 
application in three months.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr A was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks  of 
settling a previous  one and had as many  as four overlapping  Sunny loans at one 
time. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely than not Mr A was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 19 was 
taken out ten months after Mr As first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr A had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr A lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr As 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 19 and Sunny should  put things right.
Ref: DRN48627784my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
sunny.co.uk) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr A paid on loans 5 to 19;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 5 from Mr As credit  file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 19 should be removed from 
Mr As credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 November  2019.
