The complaint
Mrs J complains about how Brightside Insurance Services Limited have administered a 
motor insurance policy.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator that the case 
should be upheld. I do so for the following reasons:
Brightside made an error when processing payment instructions for Mrs Js policy, 
this meant payment for the policy wasnt taken. It also gave Mrs J incorrect 
information as to why this had happened and also threatened to cancel the policy. 
Mrs J had to make several calls to sort the matter out. 
The non-payment of the policy caused Mrs J to worry about the consequences of 
potentially being uninsured. I can reassure Mrs J, as Brightside did, that she would 
have been covered had something happened.
Mrs J later had difficulties accessing information on a portal and I think Brightside 
could have done more here to assist her. This naturally caused Mrs J frustration. 
Overall, I think the level of service offered by Brightside could have been better. I 
think it should pay Mrs J £150 to reflect the impact this had on her.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Js complaint against Brightside Insurance Services 
Limited. I direct it to pay Mrs J £150 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2023.
