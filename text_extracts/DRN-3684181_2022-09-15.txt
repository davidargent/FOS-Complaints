The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt support him in claiming 
Government support for his mortgage during the Covid-19 pandemic.
What happened
Mr M applied for universal credit as his income was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. He 
asked NatWest to complete and return a form to the Department of Work and Pensions 
(DWP) in relation to his claim for support with mortgage interest (SMI) loan.
NatWest says it has an arrangement with the DWP to return a blank form with a template 
letter setting out the relevant information. It says it couldnt stamp or sign forms while staff 
were working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. It followed this process with Mr Bs 
forms.
Mr B told NatWest the DWP had rejected its letters, and needed the form to be completed 
and either stamped or signed. NatWest said it was unable to do this. Mr B brought the 
complaint to us in February 2022.
Our investigator said while NatWest had made an error which caused a short delay, the 
£100 it paid was fair and reasonable. Mr B didnt agree. He said the real issue hadnt been 
dealt with  that NatWest hadnt provided the completed form to the DWP. As a result, his 
mortgage is in arrears and his credit file ruined.
Mr B said as of July 2022 the DWP still didnt have the form and NatWest had re-started 
recovery action. He said this was causing him anxiety and affecting his health. He asked that 
NatWest send the stamped and signed forms to him so that he could deliver them to the 
DWP himself. Mr B provided letters from the DWP supporting what he said.
NatWest says its followed the same process for hundreds of customers without issues. It 
says it no longer has a team that can stamp, date and post forms. After reviewing the letters 
provided by Mr B and speaking to a DWP representative, it arranged for an accredited staff 
member to go into the office to stamp and sign the form for Mr B. This was posted to the 
DWP in late July 2022.
I sent a provisional decision to the parties in August 2022. In summary, I said NatWest ought 
to have realised sooner that there was a problem with the way it provided information to the 
DWP in relation to Mr Bs claim. I didnt think this had caused Mr B financial loss, but had 
caused him worry and upset. I said NatWest should pay £300 compensation for this, which it 
agreed to do. Mr B didnt comment on my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr B needed help with his mortgage payments. He applied to the DWP for an SMI loan. He 
needed NatWest to provide information to the DWP to support his application. Before the 
Covid-19 pandemic this information was provided by lenders in a form  the UCMI12 form  
which the lender would complete, stamp and post to the DWP.
NatWest says it has an arrangement in place with the DWP to provide the information it 
needs in a different way, by attaching a letter to the form. This is because of staff working at 
home during the Covid-19 pandemic. It says it followed this process for hundreds of 
customers without a problem. It followed this process in September 2021 when asked to 
return the form for Mr Bs claim.
Unfortunately, the DWP didnt accept the letter provided by NatWest. Mr B provided letters 
from the DWP sent in February and March 2022. These confirm that letters provided by 
NatWest in October 2021, January 2022 and February 2022 were received by the DWP. 
However, the DWP said these letters werent sufficient and it needed NatWest to complete a 
UCMI12 form and either stamp it or sign and date it.
The DWP told Mr B it couldnt process his claim until it received the UCMI12 form from 
NatWest, completed and either stamped or signed. NatWest told Mr B it couldnt do this as 
this wasnt part of its process. When Mr B asked NatWest to complete and return the form, 
NatWest repeated the same process, providing a letter that the DWP rejected.
I must be fair to both parties here. It wasnt wrong for NatWest initially to provide the 
information in the way it did, which it says was generally accepted by the DWP. NatWest 
returned UCMI12 forms for Mr B a number of times between September 2021 and March 
2022.
I think NatWest wanted to help with Mr Bs claim, and thought it was returning the 
information in an acceptable form. What I need to consider is at what point should NatWest 
reasonably have known this wasnt the case, and it needed to do something different.
Mr B emailed NatWest in December 2021 saying that the DWP required the UCMI12 form to 
be signed and stamped by NatWest before it would process his claim. His email said 
NatWest failed to send the form which I clearly asked to be filled in and sent back to me. 
Instead I received a letter which was refused by DWP. NatWests notes show that Mr B told 
it in mid-March 2022 that the letter it was returning to the DWP was the incorrect form. 
NatWest sent a further response to Mr Bs complaint in mid-February 2022, suggesting there 
had been further discussion at that time about the format of the information.
A complaint was also raised with the DWP on Mr Bs behalf. The DWPs response (dated 9 
February 2022) is clear about needing the UCMI12 forms to be completed and either 
stamped or signed. I think matters might have been sorted out sooner if Mr B had sent 
copies of the DWPs letters to NatWest. Since receiving copies (via this service) NatWest 
has arranged for a member of staff to visit an office to complete, sign and date the UCMI12 
form. Hopefully, this will be satisfactory to the DWP.
I think the evidence NatWest had  the repeated requests for UCMI12 forms to be 
completed and Mr B saying that its letters were refused by the DWP  should have alerted it 
to a possible problem. I think it should have asked Mr B for more information about this, and 
his discussions with DWP. Had it done so, I think its likely Mr B would have been able to 
send evidence of his correspondence with the DWP. If NatWests complaints team had 
explored this more with Mr B when he raised his concerns again in mid-February 2022, he might have sent it the DWP letter dated 9 February 2022. As I said, the DWP was clear that 
it needed the UCMI12 form, stamped or signed and dated.
I dont know if the DWP will offer Mr B an SMI loan, or if this can be put in place without the 
consent of the joint account holder (which, from what Mr B says, is unlikely). If the DWP 
offers Mr B an SMI loan, payments to NatWest can be backdated to the date he was entitled 
to the loan. This would put Mr B in substantially the same position as regards his mortgage 
and SMI loan as if there hadnt been any delay. If the DWP declines Mr Bs request for an 
SMI loan, then hell be in no different position financially due to the delay. I dont think the 
delay to Mr Bs claim being processed is likely to cause Mr B financial loss such that it would 
be fair and reasonable to require NatWest to pay compensation.
From what Mr B says the mortgage arrears have affected his credit file. I think this would 
have been the case even if an SMI loan was in place. The SMI loan would only cover the 
interest. The capital part of Mr Bs contractual monthly payment would be unpaid, creating 
arrears. I dont think its fair to require NatWest to amend Mr Bs credit file.
I think though that this matter caused Mr B worry and inconvenience, some of which could 
have been avoided if NatWest had asked him more about why the DWP didnt accept the 
information it had previously sent. I think NatWest should pay compensation for this.
NatWest told Mr B it had sent forms to the wrong address in September 2021. It repeated 
this in its final response letter. This was incorrect. The documents were sent to the correct 
address. But this error (saying the forms had been sent to the wrong place) itself caused 
upset.
Mr B has told us about his health problems. His income was badly affected by the Covid-19 
pandemic, he cant meet his monthly mortgage payments and hes worried about losing his 
home. NatWests errors added to Mr Bs stress and worry. He still doesnt know if his 
application for an SMI loan will be agreed. I need to take into account that NatWest isnt 
responsible for Mr Bs difficult circumstances, only for some of the delays with his application 
for SMI. I think for the additional worry and inconvenience caused by NatWests errors, it 
should pay compensation of £300.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order National Westminster Bank plc to pay 
£300 to Mr B.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2022.
