The complaint
Mrs R complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, refused to refund her for an 
item shed returned to the seller.
What happened
On 28 March 2020, Mrs R bought an item from a seller abroad, using PayPal. She paid 
$39.98 USD, equivalent to £29.86. 
On 23 April, Mrs R contacted PayPal. She said the item was of poor quality and not as 
described. She told PayPal that the seller had said she could have a refund if she returned it, 
but it had given her a different email address which she was reluctant to use because it 
wasnt what had been agreed with PayPal.
On 9 June, PayPal emailed Mrs R and said the company had agreed to a full refund, 
provided Mrs R posted back the item to the address which PayPal provided, and uploaded 
tracking information before 19 June. PayPal said Mrs R would be responsible for the costs of 
sending the item, and it had to be in the same condition in which shed received it. PayPals 
email also said that the case would be closed if it didnt hear from her by 19 June.
PayPal sent reminders to Mrs R on 12 and 16 June. These said Please note that if we dont 
receive the information, we may be unable to resolve the dispute in your favour. Mrs R 
didnt provide return tracking information by 19 June.
On 27 June, Mrs R rang PayPal. Its customer services team said PayPal could review her 
dispute if she could provide tracking information which would confirm delivery to the senders 
address.
The same day, Mrs R paid £9.81 to Royal Mail for a click and drop parcel to be sent by 
International Standard mail. She supplied this to PayPal. But when PayPal entered the 
number online, it couldnt get any results. Mrs R contacted Royal Mai, who told her that the 
number wasnt traceable online, and shed have to check with the seller whether it had 
received her parcel back.
On 3 July, PayPal refunded Mrs Rs £9.81 postage. And on 9 July, it emailed the seller, but 
they didnt confirm receipt of the item. So PayPal refused Mrs Rs claim. 
Mrs R wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. 
The investigator didnt uphold Mrs Rs claim. She said that PayPal had followed the correct 
procedure based on its terms and conditions. She said Mrs R had been properly advised of 
the time limits to provide them with the supporting evidence.
Mrs R didnt agree. She said she had provided evidence of sending the item, and she didnt 
understand how any consumer could be responsible for delivery, which was beyond her 
control. She said she couldnt be held responsible if the tracking number didnt provide 
results, and that was an issue with the parcel company.
Mrs R said shed tried to resolve the issue with the seller before referring it to PayPal, but the 
seller hadnt been interested. However she said PayPal had said nothing different from the 
seller. She said she believed there was a huge loophole for international sellers to exploit 
consumers and PayPals protection measures were insufficient to prevent this. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Id explain what I can and cant consider. This service cant consider complaints about 
Royal Mail. And nor can this service assess whether or not PayPals protection measures 
generally are, as Mrs R believes, insufficient to protect consumers. Thats because the role 
of this service is to consider individual complaints between consumers and financial services 
organisations. Wider issues are dealt with by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
What I can consider is the specific circumstances of Mrs Rs complaint against PayPal. So 
Ive looked in detail at the events, which Ive set out above. From that, I can see that PayPal 
clearly set a deadline of 19 June for Mrs R to post back her item with evidence of tracked 
postage. It provided the address abroad to which she should send her items. And Ive also 
seen copies of the reminders which it sent to her on 12 and 16 June. 
Mrs R didnt provide evidence of tracked postage by set deadline of 19 June. So PayPal 
could have refused to consider Mrs Rs claim further at that point. In practice it agreed on 27 
June that it would review the claim further if she provided tracking information which would 
confirm delivery.
Ive also looked at the evidence which Mrs R provided to PayPal on 28 June. This shows 
that she sent the item by Royal Mail International Standard service. The Royal Mail website 
doesnt say that this offers tracking. And its website also offers three other, more expensive, 
services: International Signed; International Tracked; and International Tracked and Signed. 
So I think its likely that the service Mrs R chose to use didnt offer a tracking facility, and the 
number on her receipt was a receipt number not a full tracking number. I think this was why 
it wasnt possible for anyone to track the parcel. And it appears likely that Mrs R would have 
been able to provide tracking and delivery evidence if shed purchased a different sending 
option.
Ive checked PayPals terms and conditions, to which all users agree when using its service. 
Section 6 says:
As a non-exhaustive guide, PayPal may request and require:
a. The buyer to post back to the payment recipient an item that the buyer claims is 
SNAD   [Significantly Not As Described] and to provide proof of Delivery. 
Mrs R didnt provide this. I recognise the strength of her feeling about this complaint, but I 
find that PayPal acted in accordance with its terms and conditions when it rejected her 
refund request. It was entitled under the terms and conditions to require delivery evidence 
through tracking, and it treated Mrs R fairly by giving her longer than its original deadline to 
provide this. So I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2021.
