K821x#15Complaint
Mr S has complained that Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) did not 
carry out proper  affordability checks when lending  to him. He says he became  dependent  on 
payday loans  and became stuck in a cycle of borrowing.
Background
Mr S took 14 loans with Sunny between July 2016  and February 2018. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid  over a period of six months  but in most cases Mr S repaid the loans 
early. Some  of Mr Ss loans overlapped with one another. A summary of Mr Ss borrowing is 
shown below.

* The highest  repayment figure is sometimes made  up of multiple  payments when the 
loans overlapped.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended  Sunny refund the interest  and 
charges on loans 7 to 14 as well as making  amendments to Mr Ss credit file. She said if 
Sunny had done proportionate checks it would have  realised  at loan 7 that Mr S was having 
problems managing his money  and from loan 8 onwards the overall  pattern of Mr Ss 
borrowing suggested he had become  persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
Ref: DRN23279462Neither Mr S nor his representative provided any further arguments  or comments on the 
adjudicators view. Sunny didnt accept the adjudicators view.  It said:
Theres nothing to support that Mr S was having  problems managing his money by 
loan 7. 
It carries out affordability and creditworthiness checks for each and every application. 
The monthly repayments as a percentage  of Mr Ss income suggests these loans 
were suitable. 
Mr S paid small amounts  of interest on these  loans.
It did not agree that the overall  pattern of borrowing suggested Mr S had become  
persistently reliant on short term loans.  This was because there  was no drastic  
increase in lending. 
From  loan 9 onwards  the amounts granted decreased.
I issued my provisional decision on 3 December 2019 explaining why I was intending  to 
uphold Mr Ss complaint  about loans 9-14.
Mr S did not provide  any further evidence or arguments. Sunny did not accept  my provisional  
decision. In summary  it said it feels it did proportionate checks and these showed the loans 
were affordable.
My findings
Ive considered Sunnys response  to my provisional  decision  along with all the available  
evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. Having done so, my decision remains the same.  For completeness, I have set my 
provisional decision out below and addressed Sunnys arguments within  it to form my final 
decision.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Sunny  lent to Mr S. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Sunny. 
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words, the assessment needs  to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
Ref: DRN23279463CONC may not mention the number of previous loans a customer has had with a particular 
creditor as a relevant  factor in determining  what verification checks  are proportionate. But as 
outlined in my provisional decision, as set out in CONC, the risk to the consumer directly 
relates to the particulars  of the lending  and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a 
lenders assessment of creditworthiness  would likely  need to be flexible. That is to say, what 
is sufficient for one consumer might  not be for another, or indeed  what  might be sufficient for 
a consumer in one circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other 
circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include, 
but are not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny said it undertook  an independent  check of the information Mr S had declared in his 
application. It said it used  credit reference agency information as part of its checks  which 
takes into account all other credit  commitments, including  any short term loans which  were 
reported to the credit  reference agency, as part of every affordability assessment. 
I think the checks Sunny did were  proportionate for the first six loans  and the information 
Mr S provided indicated that the loans were  affordable. These  were  Mr Ss first few loans 
with Sunny and there was a substantial  break  in lending between loans 2 and 3. So I think it 
was entitled to rely on the information  Mr S provided about his income and expenses. At this 
stage I dont think Sunny needed to specifically ask about other outstanding short-term loans 
Mr S may have had or verify the information Mr S provided. 
But by the time Mr S asked for loan 7, Sunny should  have done more  than rely on the 
information he was providing about  his finances.  I think it should have taken steps at that 
time to independently verify Mr Ss true financial position. I dont think Sunnys  checks  
achieved this. Sunny said that the data reported to credit reference agencies is not updated 
in real time  so it didnt necessarily capture all the short term loans Mr S had taken. In 
addition, Ive seen  nothing to suggest  Sunny  independently  checked  or discovered the true 
extent of Mr Ss expenses. 
Ref: DRN23279464Mr S provided us with his bank statements and his credit file so we could see what  better  
checks would have  shown  Sunny.  But, in my view, there is not enough there  to suggest that 
better checks would  have shown Sunny it shouldnt have given loan 7 or loan 8 to Mr S.
Sunny says that there  was no drastic  increase in lending and that from loan 9 onwards the 
amounts granted decreased. But this ignores that fact that the loans were overlapping, and 
that Mr Ss overall indebtedness was increasing.
Loan 9 represented Mr Ss largest loan to date and he still had loan 5. So, in the two month  
period since loan 3, Mr Ss overall  debt to Sunny had more than doubled. Proportionate 
checks should have  gone beyond the credit searches  from credit  reference agencies that did 
not report in real time and would have shown  Sunny  that Mr S had one other short-term loan 
with another lender with the largest  payment  of £304  due to be repaid shortly.  
Mr S was regularly overdrawn and incurring unplanned over draft fees and appeared to be 
borrowing from, and repaying money to, family  or friends. So, if Sunny had done 
proportionate checks its more likely than not it would have realised  all of this and not agreed 
to lend Mr S loan 9.
Loan 10 and loan 11 were taken within days of loan 9 and Mr S circumstances hadnt 
changed. So as a responsible lender,  I dont think Sunny would have agree these loans 
either.
Sunny says it established that Mr S could  afford  the £112 repayments  on loan 9 because  he 
had a large disposable income. First of all, its affordability figures were largely based on 
Mr Ss declared expenses  I have  already  said above, I dont  think  it was enough at this 
point to rely on the figures provided  by Mr S. But I also I think its unlikely that Mr S truly had 
a disposable income of £553, otherwise I dont think he would have needed to replace  loans  
6, 7 and 8 with a loan for £300 so shortly after they were repaid or continue borrowing in the 
manner in which he did. 
Moreover, these arguments completely ignore what I said in my provisional decision  - that 
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. 
It follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
So, although  Mr S had never been in arrears,  had repaid a good proportion  of his loans early  
and settled all loans  in full, it doesnt automatically follow that he managed  to repay  them in a 
sustainable way. And the regulations are quite clear that Sunny  needed  to assess  the 
whether the credit it agreed was affordable  in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN23279465CONC 5.3.1(2) stated:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) should 
include the firm taking  reasonable  steps to assess the customer's  ability to meet repayments 
under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable  manner without the customer  incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequences.
[Note: paragraph 4.1 (box) and 4.2 of ILG]
The previous  regulator, the Office of Fair Trading set out its guidance in the Irresponsible  
Lending Guidance. Paragraph 4.2 referred  to above stated:
Whatever means and sources of information  creditors employ as part of an assessment of 
affordability should be sufficient to make an assessment of the risk of the credit  sought  being 
unsustainable for the borrower in question. In our view this is likely to involve more than 
solely assessing the likelihood of the borrower being able to repay the credit in question. We 
consider that before  granting credit, significantly increasing the amount of credit, or 
significantly increasing the credit limit under  an agreement for running  account credit,  
creditors should take reasonable steps  to assess a borrower's likely  ability  to be able to meet 
repayments under the credit agreement in a sustainable manner.
The current  regulator  has highlighted relending as a serious concern. It said in a recent letter  
(March 2019) to the CEOs of high cost credit providers that:
Following our analysis, we see two key ways that consumers may be harmed across  the 
High Cost Lenders  portfolio: 
a high volume of relending, which may be symptomatic  of unsustainable lending  
patterns
firms affordability  checks  may be insufficient,  leading to loans that customers  may 
not be able to afford.
CONC 6.7.21 stated  A firm should not refinance high-cost short-term credit  where  to do so 
is unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 of ILG]
Paragraph 6.25 of the ILG stated Repeatedly  refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's 
existing credit commitment for a short-term credit product in a way that is unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. 
The OFT considers that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower to sequentially 
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,  
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable  
manner.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  that Id also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys 
lending history with Mr S, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN23279466In reaching this conclusion, Ive taken into account  the substantial  break  in lending between 
loans 2 and 3; treating loan 3 as the first loan in the second chain of borrowing. I do not 
consider the 11 days between  loans  4 and 5 to be a significant gap.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
12. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 3 and 11 of Mr S taking new loans 
shortly after taking  out or repaying the previous ones  and often  overlapping with one 
another. I think that by loan 12, Sunny ought fairly and reasonably to have regarded 
that pattern  as established.
So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr S was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were  leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. 
Loan 12 was taken out five months after loan 3. It (along  with overlapping loans 9 
and 11) was three times the amount  Mr S borrowed on loan 3. 
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards. These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use. The sheer  number of loans was 
more likely than not to have had negative  implications  on Mr Ss ability  to access  
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 12 to 14 as well as loans  9 to 11 and Sunny 
should put things right as set out below.
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr S loans 9 to 14 and should put things right as set out below:
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  including  payments made  to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  Sunny  has already refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr S originally  made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Mr S the total of A plus B.
D.Remove any adverse  information Sunny has recorded on Mr Ss credit file in relation 
to loans 9 to 11. The overall pattern of Mr Ss borrowing for loans 12 to 14 means  
any information recorded about  them is adverse, so Sunny should  remove these 
loans entirely from Mr Ss credit  file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN23279467My final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, Ive decided  to partially uphold 
Mr Ss complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put 
things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 February  2020.
