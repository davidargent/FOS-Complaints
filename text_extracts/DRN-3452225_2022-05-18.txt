The complaint
Mr J is complaining about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have handled his 
claim for a refund under the direct debit guarantee scheme. 
What happened
On 19 November 2021 Mr J contacted NatWest to make an indemnity claim under the direct 
debit guarantee scheme for council tax payments hed been making since 2014. He said he 
hadnt given authority for the payments to be taken. The total claim was for £8,779.73 and 
was related to two properties Mr J had lived in during this time.
On 22 November 2021 Mr J contacted NatWest and gave them some more information. 
NatWest approved the claim on 9 December 2021, but Mr J didnt receive the refund. So on 
16 December 2021 he contacted NatWest again to ask what was happening.
NatWest told him the claim had been approved. They apologised for the delay, and for not 
keeping him updated - and offered him £100 (which was paid to his account shortly 
afterwards.) Refunds of the direct debits totalling £8,779.73 were paid to Mr Js account on 
the same day.
On 6 January 2022 NatWest wrote to Mr J to say theyd received information from the 
council to show hed authorised the direct debits. They said theyd be debiting his account 
for the total amount refunded on 17 January 2022. Mr J says he didnt receive this letter, so 
when the refund amount was debited he wasnt expecting it to go out. Hed spent a large 
proportion of the refund, so after his account was debited it became overdrawn.
Mr J complained to NatWest about what had happened. NatWest sent Mr J their final 
response letter on 28 January 2022. They said they thought theyd followed the correct 
process, and hadnt made an error. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest had treated Mr J unfairly. But Mr J didnt agree. He 
said, in summary, NatWest hadnt provided a hard copy of a contract with both signatures to 
show the payment to the council had been authorised. He also said he wants to see a 
breakdown of where his council tax money is being paid to, as he thinks its sent to America 
and is nothing to do with the local council. And he thinks NatWest have stolen his money.
Mr Js complaint has been passed to me for review and a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not going to uphold Mr Js complaint. Im sorry to disappoint Mr J as I 
know he feels strongly about this, but I dont think NatWest have treated him unfairly. Ill 
explain why.
The direct debit guarantee scheme isnt designed to deal with contractual disputes between 
a consumer and the originator of a direct debit. Its there to provide a consumer with a full 
and immediate refund where an error is made in the payment of a direct debit by the 
originator, or the bank or building society.  
Before making the refund, NatWest let Mr J know that it may be debited, as follows:
Before we submit your claim, you need to know that if the company rejects your claim, we 
have the right to debit the full amount from your account e.g. if the company tells us you are 
bound by a contract or the payment turns out to be valid. Please be aware that it can take up 
to 28 working days for the originator to provide this evidence. If your claim is rejected and we 
need to debit your account we will let you know 7 days in advance.
I can see the council contacted NatWest to dispute Mr Js claim  and sent them a copy of 
the direct debit mandate Mr J had signed in June 2014, a copy of the letter they sent to him 
on 20 December 2016 confirming his new direct debit amount after he told them hed moved 
house, and his council tax bills for both properties for the period. 
Mr J says NatWest havent shown him a valid contract signed by both parties. But they dont 
need to. They needed to be satisfied that the direct debit was authorised by Mr J and that no 
error was made when the payments were taken. And I think the information they received 
from the council was enough for them to be satisfied of that. Id also have expected Mr J to 
have noticed the payments leaving his account much sooner than he did, if he hadnt 
authorised them.
Overall I dont think NatWest were unreasonable to debit Mr Js account for the amount they 
refunded to him under the direct debit guarantee scheme. And I dont think they are under 
any obligation to give Mr J any more information about the councils bank accounts.
NatWest wrote to Mr J on 6 January 2022 to give him notice that theyd be debiting his 
account on 17 January 2022  so they gave him the required seven days notice. Mr J says 
he didnt receive the letter, but I can see it was sent out to his address. So I dont think 
NatWest are responsible for him not receiving it.
NatWest accepted they didnt handle Mr Js original claim quickly enough, or keep him 
updated as they should have. Mr J says he spent seven or eight hours contacting NatWest 
for updates. NatWest have paid Mr J £100 in compensation for this. Taking into account 
what went wrong here, and the impact on Mr J that hes described, I think £100 is fair and 
reasonable compensation. So Im not going to ask NatWest to do anything more.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding Mr Js complaint, for the reasons Ive explained.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2022.
