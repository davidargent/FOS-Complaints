K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains about a repossession fee thats  been applied to his account by FirstRand  
Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance.
background
A used  motorbike was supplied  to Mr B under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that he electronically signed in December 2015. He returned the bike when the 
agreement ended and paid a collection fee of £180.  His account  was settled in full but he 
then received an arrears  letter. He complained  to MotoNovo Finance and it said that a £330  
repossession fee had been applied to his account in error, his credit file wouldnt be 
impacted and it offered him £50 in recognition of the poor customer  service  that hed 
received. 
Mr B then made  a subject  access request and received a copy  of his account statement 
which referred to a repossession fee so he complained this service.  The adjudicator 
recommended that this complaint should be upheld. He said that MotoNovo Finance should:
confirm to Mr B in writing that any future applications he may make will not be 
impacted by the notes recorded  on its system;
remove any reference to repossession  fee from its systems and re-issue a closing 
statement with it removed; and
pay £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
MotoNovo Finance has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says 
that:
there has been no detriment caused to Mr B which hasnt already been addressed in 
the complaint;
future applications would not be affected as all applications for credit  are subject to a 
brand new credit  check and application; and
it would  be unable  to remove  the reference  but it wont  reflect to Mr Bs credit file.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B 
and to MotoNovo  Finance on 16 June 2020.  In my provisional decision I said as follows:
MotoNovo Finance explained in its final response letter  the error that had caused an 
arrears letter  to be sent to Mr B after his account had been settled. It apologised to 
Mr B, said that his credit file wouldnt be impacted  and it offered him £50 in 
recognition of the poor customer service that hed received. Mr B then made  a 
subject access request and complained to MotoNovo  Finance  that its internal records  
hadnt been updated. 
 
MotoNovo Finance accepts that it made an error  its apologised  for that and offered 
Mr B £50 compensation. The statement  of account shows  a credit of £330  for a 
repossession fee and that the balance of the account is zero. MotoNovo Finance 
hasnt recorded  any adverse information about  the agreement on Mr Bs credit file 
and has said that his credit file wont  be impacted.
I dont consider it to be likely than any future credit applications that Mr B makes will 
be affected by this information - and a copy of his account statement and access to 
Ref: DRN18427452MotoNovo Finances internal records wouldnt be available to a third party.  If any 
such credit  application  was adversely affected  by this information, Mr B would be 
able to make  a complaint to MotoNovo Finance about that and, if he wasnt  satisfied 
with is response,  he might  be able to make another  complaint to this service.
MotoNovo Finance said in its final response letter that Mr Bs credit file would  not be 
impacted by its error and the account  statement only refers to the repossession  fee 
against a credit of £330. I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require MotoNovo Finance to send a further letter to Mr B 
about his credit file or to remove the reference  to the repossession fee from his 
account statement.
Mr B has been caused distress and inconvenience  by the arrears  letter  that he 
received. MotoNovo Finance  offered  him £50 compensation for the poor service that 
he received. I consider  that its response  to his complaint  was fair and reasonable 
and that £50 was appropriate  compensation for the distress and inconvenience that 
hed been caused. I understand that the compensation of £50 hasnt been paid to 
Mr B and I consider that MotoNovo Finance should now pay that amount to him - I 
dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay a higher 
amount of compensation to him in these  circumstances.
So subject to any further representations by Mr B or MotoNovo Finance, my provisional 
decision was that MotoNovo  Finance  should  pay to Mr B the £50 compensation that it has 
offered to him.
Mr B and MotoNovo  Finance have  both accepted  my provisional decision.  Mr B says that 
hes disappointed that the company cannot  erase their error  from their records but he feels 
that after 18 months of stress caused by their error it is time to draw a line under this matter 
so he supports my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As Mr B and MotoNovo Finance have 
both accepted my provisional decision, I see no reason to change  it.
my decision
For the reasons  set out above, my decision is that FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as 
MotoNovo Finance, should pay to Mr B the £50 compensation  that it has offered to him.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 August 2020.
