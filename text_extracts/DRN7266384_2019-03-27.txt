K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that FCL Consumer Finance Ltd (trading as Smart-Pig) lent him money  that 
he couldnt afford to repay.
Mr K wants  Smart-Pig  to refund the interest  and charges  that he paid on the loans.
background
Mr K borrowed seven  loans from Smart-Pig between November 2012  and July 2013. A 
summary of this lending  is set out below:
No. Amount of 
loanDate of Loan Amount Repaid Date Repaid
1 £250.00 05/11/2012 £354.75 02/01/2013
2 £100.00 09/01/2013 £128.40 22/01/2013
3 £191.00 28/01/2013 £252.45 28/02/2013
4 £299.00 28/02/2013 £377.60 28/03/2013
5 £350.00 28/03/2013 £414.10 15/04/2013
6 £240.00 10/06/2013 £290.24 28/06/2013
7 £210.00 01/07/2013 £282.72 26/07/2013
The adjudicator didnt recommend upholding Mr Ks complaint. Although the adjudicator 
didnt think that Smart-Pigs checks went far enough  before  agreeing  any of the loans, she 
didnt think that better  checks  wouldve changed Smart-Pigs  decision to lend.
Mr K disagrees with the adjudicators recommendation. Mr K asks why Smart-Pig  hasnt kept 
a record of the searches that it carried out when he had to provide all the necessary 
paperwork.
Mr K says that although he was living at home when studying, he was expected to contribute  
to household costs. Mr K asks why he would keep  on borrowing money if he had as much 
disposable income as it appeared to Smart-Pig.  
Mr K also wants  to know why Smart-Pig carried out a credit check  in August 2018.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time. 
Smart-Pig was required to lend responsibly. It needed to carry out checks to make sure that 
Mr K could afford to repay his loans  sustainably when the repayment fell due. There was no 
set list of checks it needed to do, but the checks should have been  proportionate to things 
such as Mr Ks borrowing  history,  the amount he wanted to borrow and for how long.  
I understand that Mr K was a student  throughout the time that he was borrowing from Smart-
Pig. Mr K was in receipt of a grant, maintenance loan and bursary. The grant and 
maintenance loan came  to £2,581 per term which equates to a monthly income of roughly 
£860. Mr K also received  a £12,000 bursary that was paid to him over a ten month period, 
leaving him with a total monthly income of around  £2,060. This is a slightly higher  figure  than

on the basis of 12 not 10 months.   
loans one to three
Before agreeing loans one to three,  I consider it wouldve  been  reasonable to expect Smart-
Pig to ask Mr K for details of his living costs and regular financial commitments.  As I dont 
have any evidence to suggest that Smart-Pig did this, I dont consider it carried out 
proportionate checks.
Just because I dont  think that Smart-Pig  did enough  to make sure that Mr K could afford to 
repay the loans  doesnt necessarily mean that I must go on to uphold  this part of the 
complaint. I would need to be persuaded that with better checks, Smart-Pig wouldve 
discovered that some or all of the lending wasnt affordable for Mr K.
When Mr K complained to Smart-Pig  he said that his monthly  living expenses came  to about 
£700 for rent, £80 for utilities and bills, £450 for transport and parking costs, £150  for 
clothes, £300  for food and toiletries and £900 on other debt repayments. 
As we have  copies  of Mr Ks bank statements for the relevant period,  Ive considered these 
to decide what  kind of information  its likely that Mr K wouldve given to Smart-Pig  if it had 
asked him at the time.
I cant see any rent or mortgage payments. Mr K explains  that although he was living  at 
home, his family expected him to contribute to the household expenses. Even  if I say that 
some of the cash withdrawals that Mr K made during November 2012 went  towards 
household expenses, this only accounts for about  £316. 
I can see evidence on Mr Ks bank statements of monthly outgoings such  as credit  card and 
mail order payments, mobile  phone  charges  and insurance which  total around £650.  So 
when added to the cash withdrawals, Mr K wouldve been left with more than £1,000 of 
disposable monthly income around  the time of loan one.
Even if I allow for some travel and food expenses, I cant reasonably say that the repayment  
on loan one of about £350 wouldve appeared unaffordable  if Smart-Pig had sked  Mr K 
about his outgoings at the time.
Around the time of the second and third loans,  Mr Ks monthly outgoings on his bank 
statement appear to have been at similar levels to when he took out loan one. However,    
Mr K withdrew more cash than in November and December 2012.  This may be because  the 
amount that Mr K paid towards household  expenses fluctuated.  Alternatively,  it might have 
something to do with the fact that Mr K wouldve just received his bursary, maintenance loan 
and grant  so was able to withdraw  more  than usual.
I still dont think that the repayments on loan two or three wouldve appeared unaffordable 
even with better checks. Mr K withdrew £780  in cash over the course of January  2013 but 
then only withdrew  around  £80 in the following month. If I say that this averages out at about 
£475 of living costs each month, then added to Mr Ks other  commitments, he was still left 
with around £900  disposable income  each month. 
Ref: DRN72663843loans four to seven
By the time that Mr K asked to borrow loan four, hed been borrowing regularly and was 
taking on new lending  shortly after settling each earlier loan.  
I think it was reasonable  to expect Smart-Pig to try and carry out a comprehensive  check of 
Mr Ks finances to make sure that he hadnt  become reliant  on short  term lending  and could 
afford to repay each  loan sustainably.
Smart-Pig couldve verified Mr Ks outgoings  in a variety of ways such  as asking to see bills 
or copy bank statements.  As Mr K has given us bank statements, Ive used these.  
Mr K says he was borrowing from other  short term lenders  at the same time as he was 
taking loans out with Smart-Pig. However, I dont have any evidence  to suggest that this was 
the case. Mr Ks credit report doesnt  show any other short term loans between November 
2012 and July 2013 and I cant see any payments  or credits  on his bank statements.
According to Mr Ks credit report,  he was up to date with his credit card repayments. 
Although he regularly used his overdraft  facility, I cant see any returned direct  debits during 
the time he was borrowing from Smart-Pig. 
I can see some evidence  of gambling  transactions but I dont  consider  that Mr K was doing  
this frequently  enough around the time of loans four to seven to have caused concern for 
Smart-Pig.
Overall, I dont  consider  that better checks by Smart-Pig wouldve changed its decision to 
lend. I appreciate that this is likely to disappoint Mr K.
Smart-Pig said that it carried out the credit check in August 2018 by mistake.  It previously 
said that it would remove the entry from Mr Ks credit file. If Smart-Pig  hasnt already done 
this, it should  do so now.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2019.
