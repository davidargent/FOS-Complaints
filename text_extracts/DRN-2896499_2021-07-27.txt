The Complaint 
Mr and Mrs A are represented by a Claims Management Company (CMC). The CMC say 
that Mr and Mrs A received unsuitable advice by Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide).
The CMC say that Mr and Mrs A were inexperienced investors and Nationwide 
recommended investments that were too risky.
What happened
Mr and Mrs A met with Nationwide in October 2000 and were advised to invest £21,000 over 
the medium to long term. Their objective was to achieve capital growth on their savings.
Nationwide recommended a mixture of investments to Mr and Mrs A made up of the 
following:
£10,000 into a Guaranteed Equity Bond for six years
£6,000 into a Stocks and Shares ISA
£5,000 into Units Trusts 
£6,000 into Cash ISAs
Mr and Mrs A followed Nationwides recommendations and purchased the investments in 
October 2000.
The CMC complained to Nationwide on 27 October 2020 about the suitability of the 
recommendations made in October 2000. The CMC say that Mr and Mrs A received a small 
return of £129 each when the Guaranteed Bond matured. The CMC also say that Mr and 
Mrs A sold their Unit Trust and ISA investments and accepted the poor return as a result of 
poor market performance. 
The CMC say that they were given a balanced risk assessment following the fact find. The 
CMC says that it is unclear how this assessment came about as there was no set of 
questions to help Mr and Mrs A to properly assess their appetite for loss.
The CMC say that all three investments were heavily based on equities and did not offer a 
degree of balance into other lower risk investments. The CMC say that the amount 
recommended exceeded Mr and Mrs As capacity for loss and was more in line with a high-
risk investor.
Nationwide investigated the complaint and replied on 19 November 2020. In their final 
decision to the CMC, they said that they didnt believe that the advice was unsuitable and 
didnt uphold the complaint.
Nationwide said that the rules for advice were followed and it wouldnt be right or fair to 
judge the advice based on the rules currently in place. They said that the advisor sent Mr 
and Mrs A a Suitability Letter following their initial meeting and noted their objective for 
capital growth. Nationwide said the investments recommended gave long term growth 
potential and the investments suited their attitude to risk.
Nationwide said that there was nothing to suggest that the investments were not suitable or 
properly tailored to Mr and Mrs As circumstances. They said that the final decision to invest 
was with Mr and Mrs A.
Unhappy with Nationwides decision, the CMC referred the complaint to the service and one 
of our investigators investigated the complaint. The investigator didnt think that Nationwide 
had acted fairly in providing the advice to Mr and Mrs A and upheld the complaint.
The investigator thought that as they had no previous investment experience, Mr and Mrs A 
should have been advised to invest only a small portion of their savings in risk-based 
investments. The investigator thought that a cash reserve of less than 50% was unsuitable 
based on their circumstances and thought that they were advised to invest too much of their 
money in risk-based assets and should have been advised to invest in investments that 
didnt restrict growth but had capital loss protection.
The investigator upheld the complaint and said that Nationwide should calculate 
compensation to put Mr and Mrs A in the position had they not been given unsuitable advice.
Nationwide did not agree with the investigators view and asked for an ombudsman to look at 
the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator and I am going to 
uphold the complaint.
In their submission to the service, Nationwide said that the regulatory landscape was very 
different for regulated sales made in 2000 as would apply today. Nationwide said that they 
felt the sales were appropriate and in line with regulation that was in place at that time and 
shouldnt be assessed using modern day regulatory selling practices.
In reply to this, the CMC said that the adviser always had a duty of care to provide suitable 
investment advice regardless of when the advice was provided.
I agree with what the CMC say about the adviser having a duty of care to provide suitable 
advice  from what I have seen, some of the recommendations were not suitable and went 
against what Nationwide had agreed with Mr and Mrs A in terms of their attitude to risk.
In their submission to the service, the CMC has quoted Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
and Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) Principles. Although these are in place now, at the time 
of the sales a different set of rules were in place and I have not based my decision on 
current FCA or TCF Principles but on the general duty of care that would have applied to 
regulated businesses in 2000.I have looked at the fact find that was conducted by the advisor which shows what 
information was recorded from Mr and Mrs A. I have looked at what their objectives were at 
the time along with their personal and financial circumstances. Based on the information, I 
think the advice was unsuitable when the advisor recommended investments that carried a 
higher degree of risk than their chosen attitude to risk of balanced.
A balanced risk rating is described as You are willing to accept a moderate degree of risk 
and to invest a reasonable proportion of assets in equities in order to achieve a potentially 
higher return over the medium to long term.
Investment objective 
In the fact find, the advisor has noted that Mr and Mrs As main priority was to save and 
invest for the future. Another priority was for retirement planning.
The fact find records that Mr and Mrs A are looking for capital growth on savings and do not 
require an income from same as present.
This would indicate that the advisor would have suggested investments that fitted their 
investment objectives while observing the attitude to risk.
Attitude to Risk 
Nationwide have said that Mr and Mrs A chose an overall Balanced attitude to risk from the 
choices available. They said that no risk questionnaire for assessing a clients attitude to risk 
existed at the time of the sales and Mr and Mrs A were presented with different choices with 
an explanation of what risk each category carried.
Investment choices 
Mr and Mrs A chose investments that provided protection from capital risk as well as the 
opportunity for capital growth. I believe that these some investments fitted into what Mr and 
Mrs A had said was important for them:
The Guaranteed Bond had no capital risk but had the possibility of growth 
The Cash ISA had no capital risk and had additional tax benefits
The unit trust was invested into a fund with balanced risk 
I think that the above investments were suitable for Mr and Mrs A.
I think that the investments shown below were unsuitable for Mr and Mrs A as they were 
invested into funds classed as ambitious risk:
The Unit trust and ISA had no capital guarantee and equity-based returns. This 
represented nearly 23% of their savings and was not in line with their balanced 
approach.
In their submission to the service, Nationwide said that 70% of Mr and Mrs As money 
remained in capital protected investments and within the balanced risk that they wanted. 
I note what Nationwide have said but there is nothing to suggest in the file that Mr and Mrs A 
wished to have any adventurous risk investments. Nationwide have said that although Mr and Mrs A were inexperienced investors, this didnt 
mean that they werent allowed to engage in equity investment or chose anything other than 
the most cautious level. I agree that even an inexperienced investor can choose riskier 
investments if their attitude to risk is higher, but Mr and Mrs A chose a balanced attitude to 
risk  not an adventurous one.
I think that the advisor had a duty of care to recommend investments that were in line with 
Mr and Mrs As attitude to risk and I dont think that this happened with the £8,500 invested 
into the Unit Trust and ISA.
  
Putting things right
My aim is to put Mr and Mrs A back into the position they should have been in had they 
received suitable advice. I have looked at what the investigator has suggested in their initial 
view and think that it is fair and reasonable.
Mr and Mrs A have provided the service with the last valuation of their ISAs and Unit 
Trust before they surrendered it. I think Nationwide should use the surrender value 
from this date  31 March 2021.
This is because the FTSE100 index and other worldwide indices all rose between 31 
March 2005 to 28 November 2006 (the assumed surrender date). Therefore, as a fair 
compromise, I think the last valuation should be used:
Mr A
Tracker Fund
Nearest Value just before settlement 31/3/2005 £2691.75
UK Growth
Nearest Value just before settlement 31/3/2005 £2043.36
Mrs A
Tracker Fund
Nearest Value just before settlement 31/03/2005 £2691.75
Balanced Fund
Nearest Value just before settlement 31/03/2005 £2048.01
Nationwide Building Society should:
Compare the performance of Mr and Mrs As investments with that of the 
benchmark shown below and pay the difference between the fair value and the 
actual value of the investments. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, 
no compensation is payable.
A separate calculation should be carried out for each investment. 
Nationwide should also pay interest as set out below.
Provide the details of the calculation to Mr and Mrs A in a clear, simple format.

My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold the complaint.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A and Mrs A to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
