K822xcomplaint
Mr S, as a director of G, a limited  company, is unhappy with the way Lloyds Bank PLC has 
handled a complaint about the sale of a commercial overdraft repayment insurance (CORI) 
policy.
background 
In October  2018, Lloyds  upheld a complaint made  by Mr S that it had mis-sold G a CORI 
policy. Lloyds refunded the premiums (£2,561.10), the extra  overdraft interest G had to pay 
because of those  premiums (£9,481.77) and some other costs (£247.50). It also paid G 
£8,233.74 in simple  interest.
When it wrote to Mr S to explain  its offer, Lloyds said:
Please note, within your PPI questionnaire  you have stated that your CORI policy  
began on 12 July 1987. However, our systems  only show  the premiums going  back 
to 2001 and as such our refund calculation  only covers your policy from 2001 
onwards.
If you believe your policy  did begin on 12 July 1987 we will need you to provide us 
with evidence of this
However, on the next page, it said the policy start date was 19 September  1992.
Lloyds says the paragraph Ive quoted  above was included in error. And it has provided our 
service with evidence  to show that the policy started  on 19 September  1992 and that its offer 
reflects this.
Mr S says that, as a result  of Lloyds  mistake,  3 employees of G spent up to 7 hours each  
searching through old archives to try to find evidence of the policy start date. He wants 
Lloyds to compensate  G for this and the time he has spent on this complaint. He has also 
mentioned the stress and sleepless nights this matter has caused.
Our adjudicator recommended  Lloyds pay G an extra £100  and Lloyds agreed.  
Mr S says this isnt enough  and has asked that an ombudsman  make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lloyds has provided  us with a screenshot  of its internal system, which  shows  that the CORI 
policy started in September 1992.  And its provided us with a month-by-month  breakdown  
showing how its calculated Gs CORI compensation. It has refunded premiums and interest 
from September 1992 onwards.
Mr S cant  find any evidence  that the policy  was taken out before September  1992.
Im therefore  satisfied that the policy started  in September 1992,  and that Lloyds has paid G 
fair compensation for the mis-sale of the CORI policy.
Ref: DRN47858632Lloyds accepts that it made a mistake when it wrote  to Mr S in October  2018.  And it has 
offered to pay G £100 as a result. I think thats  more than enough.
Mr S told us the account was opened in 1987  and said: I am adamant we were paying the 
premium from the beginning. Anyone who refers a complaint to our service  will have to 
spend some  time on it. And as Mr S is adamant  Gs CORI policy started in 1987, I dont 
think I can safely conclude that Gs employees, at Mr S direction, would not have spent the 
same amount of time searching the archives  if Lloyds  hadnt made  the mistake.
I also think Mr S and/or  Gs representative  could have specifically highlighted to Lloyds the 
discrepancy in its letter,  either by phone or email,  and asked it to clarify the policy start date 
and confirm how it had calculated Gs CORI compensation. This may have helped  resolve  
things sooner.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I think Lloyds Bank PLC has paid G fair compensation 
for the mis-sale of the CORI policy and has offered fair compensation for the mistake  it made  
when it wrote to Mr S in October 2018.  Lloyds Bank  PLC should therefore pay G the £100  it 
has offered to pay.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S, as a director 
of G, to accept or reject my decision before 18 January 2020.
