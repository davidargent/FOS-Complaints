K820x#14complaint
Mr G complains about the service he got from National Westminster Bank Plc when he 
applied for a remortgage and further lending.  Mr G feels  that NatWests offer of 
compensation falls very short of what is appropriate in this case.
background
Mr G applied for a loan with NatWest  in January 2018 both to remortgage and for additional 
borrowing to do substantial renovations to the property. At that stage Mr G had a mortgage 
with another lender and a mortgage product with a fixed  rate of interest  that would revert to 
its Standard Variable  Rate (SVR)  on 1 August.  Mr G says that because  of errors and 
delays by NatWest  that he wasnt able to remortgage with another lender and spent 25 days  
on this lender's  SVR incurring avoidable  interest costs of £2,306.
NatWest declined Mr Gs original application on 7 February. NatWest agreed to review it but 
declined the application again on 26 June.  Mr G then emailed  NatWest  with revised plans 
reducing the overall cost of the project. On 19 July NatWest agreed  the re-mortgage  subject 
to conditions and on 21 July emailed a list of three  conditions that Mr G would have to meet. 
On 25 July NatWest provided a further set of six conditions to be met. Mr G and NatWest 
then corresponded about a number of the conditions. On 7 August Mr G emailed NatWest  
asking NatWest to agree  timely payments upon receipt of monthly certificates. NatWest 
wouldnt agree  this and on 24 August Mr G terminated his application.
Mr G was unhappy with the length of time NatWest took to process his application and with 
the conditions  it attached  before it would  sanction the borrowing. In response to Mr Gs 
complaint NatWest wrote a number of letters. On 8 March 2018 NatWest  wrote to Mr G 
setting out the reasons why it was refused  the application. In that letter  it set out that the 
application was against bank policy. The property at that time was undergoing substantial 
renovation and the banks  Mortgage  Lending Unit wasnt comfortable in becoming involved 
in a project where there  was substantial proposed works going  on. It added  that the re-
mortgage process was not geared  to insuring that the renovations had been  carried  out to 
planning approval /building regulations and couldnt monitor  the drawdown  of the additional 
borrowing nor the quality of the work.
On 13 September  2018, NatWest wrote to Mr G. In that letter it said that after the previous 
refusal it had looked again at the application on an exceptional basis.  It said that the senior 
relationship manager had attended the project on 15 June and the application  was declined 
on 26 June because of concerns about the level of contingency funding  that was in place for 
the project. NatWest says that it then got revised plans reducing the overall costs and Mr G 
gave them comfort  that he had sufficient funds  to finish  the project and more contingency in 
place so it agreed the re-mortgage subject to conditions on 18 July. The bank says that it 
emailed three of the conditions of sanction  to Mr G on 21 July and a further six by phone  to 
Mr G on 25 July. NatWest  says that by 6 August  most  of the conditions were accepted. One 
of the remaining conditions related to a letter about the staged payments. NatWest  says that 
Mr G had amended that letter to require NatWest to release  funds within 2-3 days  of receipt 
of an architects certificate which target NatWest said it couldnt  commit to meet. Nor had Mr 
G supplied a valuation.  NatWest felt that there  were  service failures and agreed to pay 
compensation of £750.
Ref: DRN12663472Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He felt that this was 
a complex application and the time taken by NatWest was reasonable to insure the 
application met its lending criteria. Our adjudicator also felt that NatWest  was entitled to 
insert such  conditions as it considered reasonable before agreeing to loan money to Mr G. 
But he felt that there  were  issues with NatWests service and that compensation of £750 was 
reasonable. Mr G disagreed saying in particular that NatWest issued him with loan 
documentation to sign which contained  errors which  it refused to change.  Mr G says that 
because NatWest proceeded with loan documents containing false or inaccurate information 
that he withdrew from the loan application  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G applied for a loan with NatWest  and some seven months later withdrew his application. 
Mr Gs complaint is that NatWest took too long to process the application and asked him to 
sign a letter which contained false or inaccurate  information.
I have taken a close  look at the history  of this application. It was clearly  a proposal that for 
NatWest wasnt run of the mill and for that reason it wasnt  comfortable with. It refused the 
application initially but then took it on again.  The application was dealt with by a number of 
people in NatWest,  some of whom  hadnt  dealt with this type of proposal before and I formed 
the view that not all the information was clearly  delivered to Mr G. In particular I suspect that 
this was the reason that it didnt inform Mr G of all the conditions  of sanction in one go but 
gave him a list of three conditions on one day and the remainder on another.  So, Mr G 
suffered some service  issues  with NatWest and should be compensated for that. I believe 
that the amount of £750 paid by NatWest is fair. 
I have looked  at whether NatWest should compensate Mr G for delays  in processing the 
application. NatWests  response is that whatever short delays may have been caused by it, 
Mr G had also caused some hold-ups. It refers  to Mr G rescheduling one of the meetings 
which was eventually held in June. It seems to me that because of the complexity  of the 
proposal it passed through a number  of hands at NatWest  that wouldnt have been 
necessary with a more  straightforward proposal.  But I have seen no evidence  of 
unnecessary delay that would justify a payment of compensation.
The other issue is the conditions of sanctions  which Mr G had to meet.  In particular Mr G 
says in his complaint form that NatWest asked  him to sign loan documentation with certain 
loan criteria that contained errors  and that he wasnt prepared  to sign those. One of 
NatWests conditions was that to handle the money for home improvements, Mr G had to 
agree by letter that  the money allocated for that would be debited from Mr Gs account to a 
Re account and paid out of that on production of architects certificates. 
Mr G was asked to sign a letter agreeing  that. Mr G wanted to borrow  £1.5m  in total part of 
which was to redeem  his mortgage and part of which was for home  improvements. The 
amount for home improvements referred to in that letter was £507,000 which was based on 
an old figure for the redemption of the mortgage  and which Mr G wasnt  happy with as the 
figure in July/August would be different. 
Ref: DRN12663473There is a note on NatWests system  dated 30 July 2018 that as the redemption figure would 
now be lower for the re-mortgage, Mr G was in touch to say that he wanted to borrow more 
now for home improvements but maintain  the same overall borrowing. On 1 August there is 
a note that NatWest  emailed Mr G asking  him for the new division between  the remortgage  
and home  improvements  within  the overall  borrowing.  On 6 August  there  is a note PMA 
(personal mortgage adviser) has been  provided with an up to date redemption  statement. 
Loan amount  not changed but this does now change the split between re-mortgage  and 
home improvements. The split is now £964,044.90  re-mortgage & £535,995.10 home 
improvements. Happy to accept this change due to time lapsed  since initial application  
Mr G says that NatWest was asking him to sign a document  with the wrong figures and that 
this was tantamount to fraud .But the presentation of the figures  in this way is 
understandable as these  were the old figures  on file. When  Mr G presented NatWest with 
different figures  and asked to maintain the same borrowing, it fairly quickly responded 
positively to that. So, I dont consider that this or the other conditions  of sanction required by 
NatWest were unreasonable. I accept that in this application there were lapses in how 
NatWest communicated  with Mr G which caused  him upset in a stressful  application. My 
view is that the amount  already paid of £750  is fair compensation for that. But apart from that 
I cant fairly say that NatWest has done anything wrong and so I dont uphold  this complaint. 
  
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2019.
