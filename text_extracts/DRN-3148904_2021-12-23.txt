The complaint
Mr N and Mrs N complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) did not report their 
mortgage to credit reference agencies.
What happened
Mr N and Mrs N had had a mortgage with NatWest since 2008. They discovered that 
NatWest hadnt reported it to the credit reference agencies (CRAs) since theyd had it. In 
April 2021, they applied for a mortgage of £198,000 from NatWest, but this was declined. 
They therefore had to go to another lender. NatWests mortgage of £100,799 was repaid in 
June 2021. An early repayment charge of £2,015.99 was charged.
Mr N and Mrs N complained that because NatWest hadnt reported their mortgage data to 
the CRAs, their credit rating had been affected. They said theyd had 13 credit agreements 
since 2008. And because of what had happened, they said theyd paid higher rates of 
interest than would otherwise have been the case. Theyd also been declined for credit 
during the period. And when they were declined for a mortgage from NatWest in April 2021, 
they said the decision must have been because of the same issue. As a result, they couldnt 
port their NatWest mortgage and had to pay an ERC - which they said wasnt fair.
NatWest apologised for their error. They updated the records at the CRAs in April 2021  
which couldve taken ten days to be completed. They paid £1,268.82 to Mr N and Mrs N  
being compensation of £1,200, plus three months subscription to two CRAs  which worked 
out at £68.82. This was so Mr N and Mrs N could see the effect of the new mortgage 
reporting. They asked for an underwriter to look at Mr N and Mrs Ns new mortgage 
application, which had been declined. NatWest said the decision had nothing to do with the 
non-reporting of the mortgage to CRAs - it was declined because of adverse data reported 
by other lenders. The ERC was payable as it was a term of their existing mortgage 
agreement.
Mr N and Mrs N brought their complaint to us. Our investigator said it was difficult to work 
out the effect of what had happened on their other credit agreements, especially as there 
was already adverse information on their credit file. He considered the compensation of 
£1,200 paid by NatWest, plus CRA fees of £68.82 was reasonable.
Mr N and Mrs N didnt agree. They said any adverse information on their credit file stayed on 
their record for six years  and so it didnt seem fair that NatWest only had to pay 
compensation of £1,200 when they hadnt reported information for 13 years. They asked that 
an ombudsman look at their complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute that NatWest made an error by not reporting Mr N and Mrs Ns mortgage 
information to the CRAs. NatWest admitted this and paid compensation of £1,200, plus three 
months subscription to two CRAs  so Mr N and Mrs N could monitor what was going on. 
And so  the crux of this complaint is  what impact NatWests error had on Mr N and Mrs N, 
and whether the amount of compensation is right for what happened. 
Mr N and Mrs N say that there were two main effects   1) NatWests decision to decline 
their mortgage application in April 2021  leading them to go to another lender and pay an 
ERC of £2,015.99 and 2) they paid higher rates of interest on 13 credit agreements over the 
years. Mr N and Mrs N say that the costs of that are more than NatWests compensation of 
£1,200. And  theyd also been declined for credit during the period.
NatWests decision to decline the mortgage application: Ive looked at NatWests 
underwriting records. They show that the decision was nothing to do with the non-reporting 
of data to the CRAs  it was because of adverse information shown at the CRAs. Ive seen 
the CRA searches and there are several credit agreements showing defaults and arrears 
during the previous six months. So, I can see that on this basis, NatWest turned down the 
mortgage application. Mr N and Mrs N then decided to arrange a mortgage with another 
lender. This meant they couldnt port their existing NatWest mortgage and so had to pay the 
ERC. And so  what happened here wasnt due to any error or unreasonable actions by 
NatWest.
Possible higher cost of credit: Ive considered this. There are valid arguments on both sides 
here. Mr N and Mrs N havent brought forward any evidence to show they paid a higher rate 
of interest, or of declined applications. And in all honesty  I think it would be difficult for 
them to do that. But also  while the CRA data is certainly important, a lenders decision to 
lend, and at what interest rate depends on many factors  not just whats on a customers 
credit file. Features such as affordability, income and expenditure, type of employment and 
home ownership also play an important part. I can see there were defaults or missed 
payments showing on some of the credit agreements  and these would also have had an 
effect on the decisions made over the period. And so  its not possible to say if there was a 
financial impact on Mr N and Mrs N, or what it amounted to.
Turning to the amount of compensation. We say an award of up to £1,500 may be made 
where the impact of a business's mistake has caused substantial distress, upset and worry. 
There may have been serious disruption to daily life over a sustained period, with the impact 
felt over many months, sometimes over a year. Given the extended time that this affected Mr 
N and Mrs N  I think NatWests error falls into this category. But because the decision to 
decline Mr N and Mrs Ns mortgage application was not connected to the error; and because 
its not possible to be sure about the effect on the various credit agreements over the years  
I think the compensation paid by NatWest is appropriate.
I know and appreciate that this will come as a disappointment to Mr N and Mrs N, but in the 
circumstances of their complaint, I think NatWest dealt with their complaint fairly and 
reasonably, and Im not going to ask then to do anymore here.

My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N and Mrs N to 
accept or reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
