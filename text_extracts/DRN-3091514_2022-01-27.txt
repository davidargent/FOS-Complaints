The complaint
Ms R and Mr S complain that they were charged an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) by 
Accord Mortgages Limited (Accord).
 
What happened
Ms R and Mr S had a mortgage with Accord which was started in 2004. In September 2019, 
the mortgage was transferred to a fixed rate of 1.94% - which was due to expire on 31 
October 2021. The mortgage was interest-only with monthly repayments of £196.92 but Ms 
R and Mr S chose to make higher payments of £700. They sold their property and repaid the 
outstanding mortgage of £110,225 on 15 June 2021. The redemption amount included an 
Early Repayment Charge (ERC) of £1,651.22. Mr S had called Accord in March 2021 to ask 
about the ERC.
Ms R and Mr S complained. Mr S called Accord in March 2021 to check his understanding of 
the ERC. Ms R and Mr S said Accord told Mr S it would be around £200 in June 2021. So  
they said theyd been misled. If theyd been properly advised by Accord, they couldve 
delayed completion of the sale until the ERC reduced. They said that by the time they found 
out about the amount of the ERC, it was too late and the buyer may have pulled out.
Accord said theyd provided misleading advice on the telephone call  and admitted theyd 
given the wrong information to Ms R and Mr S. For that, they offered compensation of £70. 
But they didnt agree to refund all or part of the ERC  because its amount was shown on 
the annual mortgage statement sent to Ms R and Mr S in January 2021. And following the 
call on 10 March 2021  Accord sent a redemption statement to Ms R and Mr S which also 
showed the ERC. Given that this was more than theyd been told on the phone, it was 
reasonable to expect them to review it and contact Accord to find out why there was a 
difference.
Ms R and Mr S didnt accept the offer of compensation and brought their complaint to us. 
Our investigator said Accord had dealt with their complaint fairly. He could see that the ERC 
was shown on the annual mortgage statement  and that it would expire on 31 October 
2021.  And also - the redemption statement sent in March 2021 showed an ERC of 
£1,679.59. So  Ms R and Mr S shouldve been aware of the amount of the ERC. He said if 
the sale had been delayed until the end of October 2021, the extra interest that wouldve 
been paid on the mortgage wouldve reduced the saving if the ERC hadnt been paid.
Ms R and Mr S asked that an ombudsman look at their complaint.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms R and Mr S, in their response to our investigators view, said they want this service to 
regulate Accord for their error. Let me say  we are not the regulators of Accord. Thats the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Our role is to resolve individual disputes between 
consumers and financial businesses based on the circumstances of their complaint  and 
thats how Ive looked at what happened here.
Ive listened to the call between Mr S and Accord on 10 March 2021. In it, Mr S was asking 
for guidance as to the amount to be paid when the mortgage was redeemed. He said the 
sale was likely to go through in June 2021. Accords call handler gave a redemption figure of 
£110,996 as at 1 June 2021 and said it included every charge. She then said the 
redemption fee was £150 or £160. Its not in dispute that this was wrong.
Ive looked at the mortgage contract dated July 2019  and this says the interest rate of 
1.94% was fixed until 31 October 2021, and there would be an ERC of 1.5%, if the mortgage 
was paid off before then. So  that was clear.
Ive also looked at the annual mortgage statement up to the end of December 2020  sent to 
Ms R and Mr S in January 2021. It says Early Repayment ChargeAmount of Early 
Repayment Charge applicable as 31.12.20 £1,699.47Date Early Repayment Charge 
period ends31-Oct-2021. 
There is also a box which shows:

Early repayment Charge for Product £ 1,699.47
Redemption Administration Fee £ 150.00
Total £ 114,447.73
Following Mr S call on 10 March 2021, Accord sent a redemption statement to Ms R and Mr 
S. This showed the amount to be redeemed if the mortgage was repaid by 10 May 2021  
and included Early Repayment Charges £1,679.59ERC Expiry date 31 Oct 2021. It also 
said Early Repayment Charges. A charge is made if part or the full loan is paid off within 
the early repayment charge period as detailed in the mortgage offer you received at the time 
you took out the products. I think this was clear  and I think its reasonable to expect Ms R 
and Mr S to have read what Accord sent to them  as at that time, they were obviously 
working through the sale of their property. 
Ms R and Mr S told us they only found out about the ERC a few days before the completion 
of the sale in June 2021  and so they couldnt then delay it. I accept that by then, that was 
probably the case as I presume contracts wouldve been exchanged and there would have 
been costs to pay. But  its also fair to say that Ms R and Mr S had had the information 
since January 2021 (the mortgage statement) March 2021 (the redemption statement), and 
so couldve done something about it earlier.
Ive thought about the actual cost to Ms R and Mr S. The mortgage was interestonly. 
Interest was around £182 a month (allowing for the fact that they were overpaying  at £700 
a month). So, if theyd delayed completion from mid-June 2021 to the end of October 2021, 
there wouldve been additional interest of approximately £820 to be paid. And they would  
have saved the ERC they paid - £1651,22. So, the net cost to them was around £830. I 
appreciate that still represents a cost to Ms R and Mr S, but its less than maybe they first 
thought.I have to balance my decision based on what Mr S was told on the phone by Accord against 
the written documents that Accord sent when the fixed rate was set up, the mortgage 
statement as at December 2020 and the redemption statement in March 2021. And Im 
persuaded that in the circumstances of this complaint it was fair and reasonable to have 
expected Ms R and Mr S to have read the documents  and if they had questions because 
of what Mr S was told on the phone  then they couldve contacted Accord. But they didnt  
and I cant hold Accord responsible for that.
I can see that Ms R and Mr S feel strongly about what happened, and will therefore be 
disappointed by my decision, but Im not going to ask Accord to do anymore here  other 
than pay the compensation theyve offered of £70. I think thats appropriate redress in this 
case. 
My final decision
Accord have already made an offer to pay £70 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is 
fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that Accord Mortgages Limited must pay £70.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R and Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
