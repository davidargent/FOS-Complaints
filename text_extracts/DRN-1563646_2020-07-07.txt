The complaint
Mrs Ns complaint is about the unnecessary delay caused by Red Sands Insurance 
Company Limited in processing a claim on her pet insurance policy, after her cat passed 
away.
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Red Sands agree it caused unnecessary delay when it processed Mrs Ns claim at a
very difficult and sad time for Mrs N.
Mrs N had borrowed money from a family member to pay her vets bill. This caused
embarrassment and friction within her family when she was unable to pay it back in
good time because of the delay.
Mrs N had to chase Red Sands to process the claim. She has told us she was
grieving the loss of her cat and this caused unnecessary upset at a time that was
already difficult for her.
So, I think a payment of £100 for the trouble and upset caused by Red Sands
mistake is reasonable. I say this as this clearly was a distressing time for Mrs N and
Red Sands accepts that it caused unnecessary delay.
My final decision
It follows that my final decision is this complaint should by upheld. In order to resolve Mrs Ns 
complaint, Red Sands Insurance Company Limited should pay her £100 for the trouble and 
upset it caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2020.
