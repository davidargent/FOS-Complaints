The complaint
Mr H complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner Finance, wasnt of 
satisfactory quality, was misrepresented to him and that a warranty was mis-sold to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr H under a conditional sale agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance that he signed in January 2019. The car was inspected by a manufacturers dealer 
in July 2020 and it said that the car hadnt been serviced correctly which had caused 
damage. The car was then inspected by another garage in August 2020 and it said that the 
car hadnt been sufficiently serviced, resulting in an imminent mechanical failure.
Mr H complained to Barclays Partner Finance but it said that Mr H had had the car for 18 
months, it had been driven for around 18,000 miles but it hadnt been serviced in that time 
which would have contributed to the issues with it. It also said that this would have voided 
the warranty. Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She thought that it 
was more likely than not that the reason for the issues with the car is that no service had 
been carried out on the car within the 18 months that Mr H had possession of it before the 
issues began. And she didnt think that the car had been misrepresented to Mr H.
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
dealer inspected the oil before the car was supplied to him and deemed it to be ok but both 
of the reports have said that, had the oil been checked at that time, then it would have been 
identified that there was an issue  so the inspection wasnt carried out competently. He also 
says hes provided two reports stating that the issues with the car would have started before 
it was supplied to him and that there was nothing he could have done to prevent the 
damage. He says that he strongly believes that the car was mis-sold to him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Barclays Partner Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H - whether or not it was 
of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the 
age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr H was about four years old, had been driven for 
60,808 miles and had a price of Â£9,700;
Mr H signed a collection documentation checklist when the car was supplied to him 
which confirmed that the cars service book was present and that he received a 
service print out  it also showed that the oil had been checked; 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the dealer had agreed to service the car before it 
was supplied to Mr H  and it says that it wouldnt normally service a car unless that 
was agreed with a customer  and I consider it to be more likely than not that the oil 
check was to check the level of the oil and wouldnt have involved a more detailed 
check than that (and wouldnt have included a change of the oil);
the car had been serviced in February 2017 so was due another service in February 
2018 in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations  about a month after 
the car was supplied to Mr H  and I consider that he was provided with enough 
information so that he ought reasonably to have known that the car would soon need 
a service;
Mr H had agreed in the conditional sale agreement that he would: Pay to keep and 
maintain the vehicle in a good state of repair and condition and make sure it is 
regularly serviced in line with the manufacturer's recommendations and any warranty 
that applies;
Mr H used the car for about 18 months and the car was driven for about 18,000 miles 
in that time but Mr H didnt have the car serviced during that time  it did pass an 
MOT test in October 2019  but it hadnt been serviced between February 2017 and 
August 2020;
the manufacturers dealer that inspected the car in July 2020 said: At some point the 
oil level has been low due to not being serviced correctly before customer bought 
car. This has caused damage;
the garage that inspected the car in August 2020 said that:   the engine had not 
been sufficiently serviced, this has resulted in an imminent mechanical failure of  
the engine, vacuum pump, turbo charger system and oil pump  due to the length of 
time the oil has been in the engine, it had coagulated  this issue would have begun 
before [Mr Hs] ownership of the vehicle  [Mr H] is at no way in fault for the issues 
the vehicle are facing;
although the inspections were performed by qualified mechanics, I dont agree with 
the conclusions that they have reached - I consider it to be more likely than not that 
Mr Hs failure to have the car serviced will have at least contributed to the issues that 
have developed with the car and mean that he has breached the terms of the 
conditional sale agreement;
had the car been serviced in February 2018, I consider it to be likely that its oil would 
have been changed and that may have been enough to prevent the issues that are 
now affecting the car;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H and I dont consider that Mr H would 
have been able to use the car to drive 18,000 miles in 18 months if it hadnt been of 
satisfactory quality at that time;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car was 
misrepresented to Mr H by the dealer or that the warranty was mis-sold to him;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that he has with the car and for the costs that 
hes now facing, but I dont consider that Barclays Partner Finance has acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances; andI find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to allow Mr H to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2021.
