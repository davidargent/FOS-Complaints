The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc will not allow payments to a third party 
cryptocurrency exchange company.
What happened
Mr P has been trying to make payments to a third party cryptocurrency company from July 
2021 but says NatWest have changed their policy and they do not allow payments to go to 
the company he is trying to pay. Mr P says the company he is trying to send money to 
operates legally in the United Kingdom, and he hasnt agreed to NatWest changing the 
terms of his account to block payments being made to the third party company. Mr P says 
NatWest should not be able to prevent his payment being made. Mr P complained to 
NatWest.
NatWest did not uphold his complaint. They said that due to an increase in cryptocurrency 
scams and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the company he was attempting to pay, they 
had taken steps to restrict payments to the third party company Mr P was trying to pay until 
further notice. NatWest said this doesn't mean that they block cryptocurrency payments 
altogether, but they will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the 
highest risk of financial harm. NatWest also said they were aware that the third party 
company were currently not accepting some payment types, so he may wish to reach out to 
the third party directly. 
Mr P brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator did not uphold his complaint. She 
explained that NatWest acted in line with their terms and conditions as these made it clear 
that NatWest may refuse to act on a customers instructions if they reasonably consider that 
there is a high risk of a connection to fraud. And NatWest may restrict the use of a 
customers account if they believe its appropriate in order to protect it.
Mr P asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint. He made a number of points. In 
summary, he said NatWest acted unfairly and unlawfully in restricting access to his money 
and blocking payments to legal services resulting in him being at a substantial financial loss 
that NatWest should be liable to reimburse him for. Mr P says NatWest has not provided any 
evidence to support cryptocurrency attracting a higher risk of fraud. Mr P also highlighted 
that NatWest had recently started to allow payments to cryptocurrency exchanges again, 
such as the third party he had been trying to pay for so long, but they didnt contact 
customers to inform them of their change of policy.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset Id like to emphasise that this service is not the regulator. Nor do we act as the 
enforcer for the regulator. The regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority. Our service acts 
as an informal dispute resolution service for complaints about financial businesses. We look 
at the circumstances of individual complaints and, on a case by case basis, taking into 
account relevant industry guidance for example, make findings about whether a financial 
business has failed their customer in any way.
Where we find they have, we make awards designed to make the business put things right 
with the complainant customer. Our awards are not designed to punish a business or to 
make it change the way it acts in order to protect other customers in the future. That is the 
role of the regulator.
Mr P has made a number of points to this service and NatWest and Ive considered and read 
everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal 
body Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
Ive considered what Mr P has said about NatWest blocking his payments to the 
cryptocurrency exchange firm is unlawful. Its for the courts to make findings on matters of 
law, and it wouldnt be appropriate for me to make a finding that NatWest have broken any 
laws. Although I am required to take law into account, if its relevant, in deciding whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of a complaint.
Here though, Im satisfied that Mr P was treated fairly by NatWest. Their terms and 
conditions, which Mr P would have agreed to upon opening his account, shows that they can 
stop payments being made from a customers account if they reasonably believe its 
appropriate to protect a customers account. NatWest have regulations they need to follow to 
help protect customers funds.
Although I fully appreciate that Mr P genuinely wanted to make the transaction and he was 
not a victim of fraud or a scam, NatWest would still be entitled to take the action that they 
did. I say this as they explained in their final response letter to Mr Ps complaint that they 
were taking action to address the highest risk areas to protect their customers to the 
particular firm that Mr P wanted to pay.
While Mr P says that NatWest blocked all cryptocurrency payments as they also blocked 
another third party cryptocurrency payment Mr P attempted, NatWest refute this as they 
explained that they would only block payments to the cryptocurrency exchanges that present 
the highest risk of financial harm. 
Ive considered what Mr P has said about there being no evidence provided that payments to 
cryptocurrency exchanges result in higher fraud. But NatWest would be well placed to know 
how many of their customers have been affected to fraud and scams in this area. In addition, 
NatWest would be aware, following a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announcement, that 
customers are being increasingly targeted by cryptoasset-related scams. This is shown on 
the FCA website alongside information about investing in cryptocurrency more generally and 
the risks involved with it. Action Fraud has also published a warning on cryptocurrency 
scams.
Ive considered what Mr P has said about NatWest recently allowing customers to now 
make payments to cryptocurrency exchanges, including the company he had been trying to 
pay. But fraud trends will change from time to time. Fraud and scam trends can be fluid, in 
the sense that they are highly likely to change over time. So what was deemed high risk 
previously can become less of a risk over time and vice versa. 
Mr P has noted that NatWest hadnt informed their customers that they had changed their 
policy to recently allow payments to the third party he was trying to pay. But NatWest are not 
required by the regulator to communicate policy/procedure changes to their customers. They 
are required to communicate changes to their terms and conditions to a customer. But Im 
not persuaded they have changed any of their terms and conditions by changing their policy here. I say this as NatWest would still have the right to protect their customers by stopping 
payments, if they reasonably thought there was a risk to their customers.
In summary, Im satisfied that NatWest acted within their terms and conditions to prevent 
payments to the third party firm in question. So I wont be asking NatWest to pay Mr P for 
any investment gains he would have benefitted from if he was able to make the payments to 
the cryptocurrency exchange company when he wanted to. Mr P is still entitled to take 
NatWest to court if he feels they have acted unlawfully. But it follows that I dont require 
NatWest to do anything else.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2022.
