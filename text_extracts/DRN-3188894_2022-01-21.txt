The complaint
Mr B says Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited (Mutual) lent to him irresponsibly.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He said that by loan 6 a proportionate check 
wouldve shown Mutual that Mr B was having problems managing his money. He went on to 
say that Mutual shouldnt have approved any lending from loan 12 onwards as the lending 
pattern itself was harmful by then. 
Mutual disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. Ive read in total what Mutual has said, 
and its own summary of this is below:
No reasons or explanation have been given by this service to support its view and 
the assertions made. No rules or regulatory guidance have been cited to support the 
view.
The mid-cost of Mutuals product, the length of the product and the product features 
have been assessed with a short-term lending approach which is not appropriate to 
its lending.
Mutual robustly assess affordability and creditworthiness in a manual review 
including considering the sustainability of the lending. Its processes have been 
reviewed by the industry regulator with great scrutiny.
The industry regulator has said repeat lending in home credit is common and does 
not cause harm.
There is no evidence the customer was reliant on the loans, there are gaps in the 
provision of the loans.
No evidence has been provided by the customer to show the loans caused them 
financial problems.
The credit report showed the customer was not in financial difficulties.
The customer has repaid all outstanding credit early receiving early settlement 
rebates. They have paid off all accounts and not borrowed again.
FOS have found that agreement 6 with a weekly payment of only 53p is 
unsustainable which does not make sense.
Mr B agreed with the adjudicators opinion. Ive noted what he said in response, although he 
didnt provide any new evidence or arguments. I have reviewed all of the evidence provided.
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mutual needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mutual should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Mutuals response concerns how it defines the cost of the credit and the risk of it to Mr B. It 
also concerns our approach to repeat lending. This Service has responded to Mutual on 
these issues in detail through other final decisions it has received, and the published 
decisions on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at length here.
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as 
does the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within its 
identified high cost credit cohort. And while I note it has a longer term than, for example, a 
payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as 
such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said 
anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered these issues alongside everything 
else in making my decision.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And, for the avoidance of doubt, 
given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about this lending. 
But it was part of the borrowing relationship Mr B had with Mutual. So, it is something I will 
take into account when considering the other loans he took.
Loans 6 to 11
Loan 6 was for a relatively modest amount, and so the repayments were lower. But this was 
Mr Bs sixth longer term loan in just over a year. And up to this point he had only been able 
to repay loans 1 and 3  loans 2, 4 and 5 were still running. So he had four loans 
outstanding when he took this one, some of these other loans were for much larger 
amounts. 
And that fact that Mr B needed to borrow money but to repay it at the rate of only £0.53 a 
week is a sign he was unable to really repay this lending. And in reality his weekly 
repayments are far higher than this due to the other loans he already had. 
So, I think Mutual couldve realised at that time that Mr B may have some longer-term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. Mutual shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about 
Mr Bs true financial situation.I think that it wouldve been proportionate to fully review Mr Bs financial situation and I dont 
think Mutual did this. So, I need to think about what Mutual wouldve likely seen if it had 
carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr B has provided some information about his financial circumstances which includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit file. I accept that this isnt exactly what Mutual wouldve, 
or mayve, seen at the time. But I think it wouldve found out similar information if it had 
made proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on the information Mr B has 
provided this Service.
This shows that Mr B did have some problems managing his money. Most importantly his 
bank statement shows he was using a significant amount of other credit providers and he 
was having problems repaying these. His credit report shows had recently defaulted on 
catalogue accountsand was clearly not in a position to sustainably repay any further lending.
I think that Mutual wouldve found out this information if it had made proportionate checks. 
And I think Mutual wouldve seen Mr B wouldnt have been able repay the loans in a 
sustainable way. The information I have doesnt show that Mr Bs circumstances changed 
materially going forward. So, I think that Mutual shouldnt have given loans 6 to 11 to Mr B 
and I think hes lost out as a result of this. Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about loans 6 to 
11.
Loans 12 to 20. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Mutuals lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mutual should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mutual should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached 
by loan 12. I say this because:
Mr B had been indebted to Mutual for around a year and half. The loans were 
intended to run for around two years, so Mutual could have expected a longer-term 
relationship but this was still a long time to be using this type of credit. And Mr B was 
already due to make repayments to Mutual for a number of years.   
Mr B had taken a significant number of loans. So because these loans overlapped, 
his overall indebtedness,  and weekly repayments, had increased over this this 
period. 
So, rather than the picture of decreasing indebtedness which would happen when a 
loan is taken and repaid, there was a pattern of repeated and increasing borrowing. I 
think this is a strong indicator that Mr B was still struggling financially.
And at this point Mutual ought to have known that Mr B was not likely borrowing to 
meet a shorter-term shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
So, because of the above factors, Mutual ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not that Mr Bs indebtedness was now unsustainable. 
And this is reflected in the information Mutual recorded about why Mr B started these 
loans. The majority of these loans were used to fund the purchase of goods. It isnt 
necessarily or automatically unreasonable to use this type of credit to do this. But 
using a high cost form of borrowing over a prolonged period is still likely to have 
caused financial problems, and as Ive said earlier its clear Mr B was in difficulty 
already before this. 
Mr B didnt make any real inroads to the amount he owed Mutual. Loan 20 was taken 
over three and a half years after Mr Bs first. So, the harmful pattern I think was established from loan 4 continued. Mr B had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Mutual over a long time.
I think that Mr B lost out because Mutual continued to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 20 and Mutual should put things 
right.
Mutual has referred to the 2020 High Court judgement in the case of Kerrigan vs Elevate 
Credit International Limited. It has essentially said that the judge in this case said that the 
relationship could be fair if there are a lower number of loans per year. For example, under 
four loans a year. It said, as it lent a lower amount than this, then this would indicate, on the 
same basis as the court case, that it hadnt lent unsustainably.
Firstly, looking at the courts findings at this point in the judgement, the judge was talking 
about whether an unfair relationship had developed. This is a different question, with some 
different considerations, than whether a loan or series of loans, has been lent irresponsibly.
I accept that there can be some overlap between whether a pattern of lending itself shows 
that the lending is unsustainable, and a relationship is unfair. But the court in this judgement 
was considering issues related to short term high cost credit rather than home collected 
credit. I can see Mutual has acknowledged they are different products with different 
considerations. And indeed, has repeatedly been keen to distance its products from those of 
short term high cost credit providers. So, this means that the judges conclusions about a 
differently structured product shouldnt and cant be directly applied here.
And in any event the number of loans is just one aspect of decided whether a lending pattern 
is harmful. The loan size, duration of loans, the repayments and other factors need to be 
also looked at, as Ive done above.
So, whilst I have noted Mutuals submissions on this point, it hasnt introduced any 
arguments which persuade me to change my opinion about this complaint.
  
Putting things right
Mutual shouldnt have given Mr B loans 6 to 20.
A) Mutual should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Mutual should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Mutual should pay Mr B the total of A plus B.D) Mutual should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Bs credit file in 
relation to 6 to 11. The overall pattern of Mr Bs borrowing for loans 12 to 20 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Bs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mutual to deduct tax from this interest. Mutual should 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax Mutual has deducted, if he asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
