The complaint
Mr C complains about the way that LeasePlan UK Limited has dealt with penalty charge 
notices relating to the use of a van that he hired from it.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr C hired a van from LeasePlan under a hire agreement that he signed in 
December 2014;
the agreement said: we will charge an administration fee of £42 (incl. VAT) each 
time we pay a fixed penalty, fine, congestion or other charge in connection with the 
Vehicle or its use, in addition to requiring you to reimburse us in respect of such fixed 
penalty, fine, congestion or other charge ;
LeasePlan received penalty charge notices relating to Mr Cs use of the van  
including 56 notices in June and July 2019 for which charges totalling £3,416 were 
made  and it invoiced Mr C for the charges that it had received and administration 
fees;
Mr C complained to LeasePlan and then to this service but our adjudicator didnt 
think that LeasePlan had made an error or acted unfairly;
Mr C, as the hirer of the van, is responsible for the penalty charge notices that have 
been issued relating to the use of the van and I consider that he knew, or ought 
reasonably to have known, that the van was being used in a way that was likely to 
incur penalty charge notices;
he says that he accepts responsibility for some of the charges and will pay for them 
but that the majority of the penalties relate to the use of a tunnel and hes disputing 
those penalties with the tunnel operator because the signs arent clear;
he says that LeasePlan should have notified him of the charges more quickly than it 
did which would have made him aware that he was incurring charges and he would 
have been able to avoid further penalties;
but the penalties were incurred in a relatively short period of time and Im not 
persuaded that there was any unreasonable delay by LeasePlan in sending 
information about the notices to Mr C  and Im not persuaded that it was required to 
do more to notify him about the charges;
I sympathise with Mr C for the substantial additional amount that he now has to pay 
to LeasePlan but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
LeasePlan has acted incorrectly in connection with those charges;
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
LeasePlan to reduce the amount that its charged Mr C for the penalty charge notices 
and administration fees, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint; and
I suggest that Mr C contacts LeasePlan, if he hasnt already done so, to try to agree 
an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount that he owes to it  and, if hes 
suffering financial difficulties, its required to respond to those difficulties positively 
and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
