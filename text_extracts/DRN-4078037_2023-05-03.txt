The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr Ms complaint is about a credit card provided by NewDay. The account was opened in 
September 2020 with an initial credit limit of £600. The credit limit was increased to £1600 in 
April 2021 and to £2000 in October 2021.
Mr M complained that NewDay lent to him irresponsibly. NewDay upheld Mr Ms complaint 
from 11 October 2021 when the credit limit was increased to £2000. It acknowledged that 
the credit limit increase wasnt suitable because of Mr Ms financial circumstances.
NewDay refunded interest and charges of £771.16 on the account. It also upheld a similar 
complaint about an Aqua card and refunded interest and charges of £95.47. Because there 
was a balance outstanding on both accounts, the refunds were credited to the accounts to 
reduce the outstanding balance.
Mr M wasnt happy with the outcome. He said NewDay shouldnt have provided him with the 
credit card because he had a gambling addiction.
Our investigator said the offer from NewDay was fair.
Mr M didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set out on our 
website, Ive had this approach inn mind when considering Mr Ms complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it shouldve carried out reasonable and proportionate checks to 
ensure that Mr M could repay the credit in a sustainable manner. Theres no set list of 
checks that a lender has to carry out but the checks could include things like how much was 
being lent, the repayment amount and Mr Ms income and expenditure and credit history.
Account opening
Ive reviewed the available information. Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDay carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks before approving the credit card. It gathered 
information about Mr Ms outgoings and reviewed his credit file. I dont think the information 
wouldve given NewDay any cause for concern or necessitated further checks.
Credit limit increases
NewDay has said that it reviewed Mr Ms credit file and considered the information it already 
held about him before approving the credit limit increases in April 2021 and October 2021. 
However, NewDay accepts that, given the information it was given a out Mr Ms financial 
circumstances, the credit limit shouldnt have been increased in October 2021.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDay has acted fairly by refunding the interest, fees and 
charges on the account incurred since the credit limit increase on 1 October 2021. This is in 
line with what this service would ask NewDay to do in circumstances where the credit limit 
increase was found to be unaffordable.
Mr M has said that he doesnt think that NewDay shouldve provided him with the credit card 
at all because of his gambling addiction. He says he told NewDay about his gambling 
addiction. Ive looked into this but theres no evidence to suggest that NewDay was aware 
that Mr M had gambling issues at the time it approved the credit card. The system notes 
show that the first time Mr M made NewDay aware that he had gambling issues was in June 
2021.
Taking everything into account I dont think NewDay has treated Mr M unfairly. I dont think 
the decision to open the credit card account was irresponsible so I wont be asking NewDay 
to do anything further.
Mr M has raised a further issue a out a chargeback which he says was rejected by Lendable. 
This didnt form part of Mr Ms initial complaint and hasnt been addressed in NewDays final 
response. Mr M needs to raise a complaint with NewDay about this and wait for a final 
response before this service can look into it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2023.
