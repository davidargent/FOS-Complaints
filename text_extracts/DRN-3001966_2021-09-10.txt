DRN-3001966
The complaint
Miss L is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed her current 
account without consulting her first.
What happened
Miss L was residing overseas and discovered that NatWest had closed her UK current 
account without any notification or prior consultation with herself. Miss L wasnt happy about 
this, or about the conflicting information she received from NatWest when she asked them 
about it. So, she raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Miss Ls complaint. But they noted that they closed Miss Ls account 
because it had been inactive with a zero balance for several years and that such a closure 
was inline with their internal policies. NatWest also noted that in instances where an account 
was left inactive without a residual balance of any kind, it was also their policy to close the 
account without sending any form of prior notification to the account holder. Because of 
these points, NatWest didnt uphold Miss Ls complaint.
Miss L wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest 
had acted unfairly or unreasonably by following their own policies which had led to the 
closure of Miss Ls account, so they didnt uphold Miss Ls complaint.
Miss L remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been frustrating for Miss L to have discovered that 
NatWest had closed her UK current account, especially given that the closure was 
undertaken by NatWest without any prior notice. 
NatWest have confirmed that the closure of Miss Ls account was undertaken inline with 
their own internal policies which include that an account that hasnt been used for several 
years and which doesnt hold any balance is considered as being inactive and is closed 
without prior notice being given to the account holder. 
It isnt within the remit of this service to instruct a business to not apply its own policies, but 
this service can instruct a business to take corrective action if its deemed that the 
application of those policies has led to an unfair outcome. 
However, I dont feel that the closure of Miss Ls current account by NatWest has resulted in 
an unfair outcome in this instance, and one of the reasons I say this is because the account 
had been dormant with a zero balance for a prolonged period. Given these circumstances, it 
wouldnt be expected by this service that NatWest would maintain Miss Ls current account 
indefinitely, and because of this Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NatWest to want to 
close Miss Ls account.
Miss L contends that NatWest ought to have consulted with her before closing her account, 
and that if they had, Miss L would have informed them that she wanted to maintain the 
account and would have taken any actions necessary to do so. 
NatWest have confirmed that their policy in these circumstances is that they only contact 
customers who maintain a balance in the account  which Miss L did not. I can appreciate 
why NatWest might draw a distinction between accounts left with a residual balance as 
opposed to accounts left with a zero balance, and it seems reasonable to me that NatWest 
might consider an account left unused for several years with a zero balance as simply being 
an unwanted account. I can also appreciate why NatWest might not contact a customer in 
such circumstances before closing that inactive account.
It also must be remembered that Miss L had ample opportunity to use the account such that 
it couldnt be considered as being inactive during the several years that it remained unused 
with a zero balance, and that ultimately Miss L didnt do this.
Miss L has explained to this service that she tried to obtain a replacement debit card on the 
account in 2019, which she feels should have demonstrated to NatWest that the account 
shouldnt have been considered as unwanted or inactive. However, NatWest have no record 
of such an approach made by Miss L in 2019, and while our investigator did request a copy 
from Miss L of the email that she confirms was sent to NatWest by her relating to this matter, 
Miss L has not subsequently provided that email, or anything else which could confirm her 
assertion in this regard to this service. 
All of which means I find it very difficult to conclude that NatWest have acted unreasonably 
or unfairly towards Miss L here by closing her inactive current account in the manner which 
they did. 
Miss L has also stated that NatWests closure of her account has caused her significant 
difficulties on her return to the UK. While I can sympathise with Miss Ls position here, given 
that I dont feel that it was unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to have closed Miss Ls 
inactive account, it follows that I wouldnt consider NatWest accountable for any 
consequences that Miss L might have encountered because of that account closure.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Miss L was wanting here, but it follows that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action at this 
time. I trust that Miss L will understand, given what Ive explained above, why Ive made the 
final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2021.
