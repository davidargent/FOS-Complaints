Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about nine instalment loans Sunny provided  to Mr C between                
June and November  2015. Mr Cs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 16/06/2015 25/06/2015 7 £100.00 £39.25
2 18/06/2015 24/06/2015 7 £100.00 £77.90
3 04/07/2015 25/08/2015 6 £100.00 £38.05
4 25/08/2015 29/09/2015 6 £200.00 £78.45
5 02/09/2015 29/09/2015 6 £50.00 £97.90
6 04/09/2015 29/09/2015 6 £200.00 £76.70
7 03/11/2015 07/11/2015 6 £50.00 £18.40
8 03/11/2015 07/11/2015 6 £50.00 £19.45
9 23/11/2015 15/01/2016 7 £100.00 £37.45
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Cs borrowing indicated  he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  Sunny disagreed  and 
said Mr Cs behaviour didnt indicate he was struggling financially, and his disposable 
income was enough to repay the loans. But it did offer to uphold Mr Cs complaint from     
loan 7 onwards.  The offer was put to Mr C, but he rejected it. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN93711942the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Having done  so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Cs complaint  about loans 1 to 5. Mr C hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out six loans in just less than three months and had 
taken out loans 4, 5 and 6 in just under  two weeks. So, it should have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr C was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Loans 4, 5 and 6 were all repaid  on the same day. The fact Mr C repaid his loans 
much earlier  than planned - and sometimes  in bulk - should  have caused some 
Ref: DRN93711943concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate 
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans 
on a regular basis
Mr Cs first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £200. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that it was unlikely Mr C was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
his income but more  to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr C was provided  with new loans in rapid  succession.  For 
example, loans 7 and 8 were taken out on the same day  within an hour of each 
other. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  9 was 
taken out five months after Mr Cs first. And it was for the same amount. Mr C had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect; service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 6 to 9 should be removed from      
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN93711944my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 May 2020.
