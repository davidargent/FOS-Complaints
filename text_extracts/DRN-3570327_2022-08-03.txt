The complaint
Mr B complains that Leeds Building Society removed him from a joint mortgage and possibly 
the property title. Hed like the position to be confirmed.
What happened
Mr B took out a joint mortgage with Leeds in 2004. Hes separated from the joint account 
holder.
Leeds confirmed it hadnt removed Mr B from the joint mortgage account or asked the Land 
Registry to remove him from the title. Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint 
be upheld.
Mr B remains concerned about a number of matters.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B provided background and information about his circumstances. Hes unhappy about 
court processes and actions of public bodies, some of which he says isnt lawful. Were an 
informal dispute resolution service, separate from the courts. I cant make findings about 
court processes or decisions, or whether a person or public body has acted lawfully. These 
are matters better raised through the courts  which Mr B says is something hes pursuing.
I can look into the complaint Mr B raised with Leeds. That is, that it removed him from the 
mortgage account, and possibly the property title. He asked it to confirm the position.
Leeds confirmed Mr B was still on the mortgage account. It said it hadnt made any request 
to remove him from the property title. It sent a copy of the property title to Mr B. I think Leeds 
responded fairly to Mr Bs complaint and I dont think its fair and reasonable to require it to 
take any further steps.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2022.
