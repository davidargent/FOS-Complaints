DRN-3479439
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc transferred his account to a third party 
without his authorisation.
What happened
Mr D says that NatWest closed his credit card account and it was agreed no further interest 
would be added and he would pay the outstanding balance in instalments. NatWest then told 
Mr D it had transferred his account to third party. Mr D says he doesnt want to work with the 
third party and didnt authorise the transfer.
NatWest explained that once an account is defaulted and terminated it is passed to an agent 
to manage and to agree a repayment plan. It said that the correct process was followed in 
regard to Mr Ds account.  
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. She said that due to Brexit, NatWest could no 
longer operate Mr Ds accounts and as Mr D couldnt settle the outstanding balance on his 
credit card account a long-term payment plan was agreed. Our investigator noted that Mr Ds 
account hadnt been sold but the repayment plan was being managed by a third party. She 
said that NatWest was acting within its terms and conditions and wasnt required to obtain 
Mr Ds consent for this.
Mr D didnt agree with our investigators view. He said that the collection agent wasnt part of 
NatWest and that NatWest didnt have his authority to pass his account to it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why this situation is frustrating for Mr D. I note the information he has 
provided that his account management was taken back by NatWest from the initial third 
party and then he was contacted to say it would be passed to another third party. I 
appreciate this wasnt what Mr D wanted to happen but, in this case, I do not find that 
NatWest has done anything wrong.
As already explained, Mr Ds account hasnt been sold but instead the management of the 
repayment plan has been passed to a third party. Mr D was informed that his account would 
be managed by a third party when the repayment plan was discussed. NatWests website 
sets out the debt management companies it works with and the reason for it using these. As 
NatWest has explained that this is its usual process in cases such as Mr Ds I do not find I 
can say NatWest has treated Mr D unfairly. 
I have looked at the terms and conditions for NatWests credit card and, as our investigator 
previously outlined, these allow for the transfer of information about the agreement and the 
transfer of NatWests rights and duties under the agreement. Therefore, I do not find I can 
say that NatWest acted outside of the account terms and conditions in the actions it took.
In conclusion, while I appreciate that Mr D doesnt want to deal with a third party, I do not 
find that NatWest has done anything wrong by transferring the management of his 
repayment plan. Therefore, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2022.
