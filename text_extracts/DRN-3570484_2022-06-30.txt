Complaint
Mrs A and Mr A are unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed their 
accounts and then denied them access to their funds. 
Background
In July 2021, NatWest took the decision to close Mrs A and Mr As current and savings 
accounts. NatWest told Mrs and Mr A that this was a course of action it was entitled to take 
and it didnt need to provide them with a reason for its decision. 
Mrs and Mr A were unhappy with this and the fact that they were told it could take up to 60 
days for them to be able to access the funds in their accounts. And they complained to 
NatWest about these matters. NatWest didnt uphold Mrs A and Mr As complaint.              
Mrs A and Mr A remained dissatisfied and asked us to look into the matter.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mrs A and Mr As concerns. She thought that NatWest 
was entitled to close Mrs A and Mr As account but given the circumstances it took too long 
to return Mrs A and Mr As funds to them. NatWest challenged the adjudicators view. After 
being told the case was being passed to an ombudsman, NatWest asked for extra time to 
consider its position. As that extra time passed without an acceptance from NatWest the 
complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision as previously advised.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered matters, Ive decided to uphold Mrs A and Mr As complaint. Ill 
explain why in a little more detail. 
As our adjudicator explained, NatWest, or any other bank for that matter, is under no 
obligation to continue offering an account to a customer if it doesnt wish to do so. So while I 
appreciate Mrs A and Mr A felt at their account being closed, NatWest was perfectly entitled 
to take the decision that it no longer wanted them as customers. And I dont think that 
NatWest did anything wrong or acted unfairly in relation to this matter.
That said, NatWest blocked access to the funds in Mrs A and Mr As accounts. NatWest has 
said that its terms and conditions state that it can take up to 60 days to release the funds 
from an account and as it released the funds within this period of time it didnt do anything 
wrong. But Id expect 60 days to be the absolute maximum period of time for NatWest to 
return a customers funds. And I dont think that simply returning the funds within 60 days will 
automatically mean that it will have acted fairly and reasonably towards a customer in every 
case. I think that this is an important point for me to make as Im mindful of the particular 
circumstances of this case.
As I understand it, the current account NatWest closed was the main account Mrs A and    
Mr A used to meet their regular household expenditure. In particular Mrs A and Mr A told 
NatWest that they needed to access the funds in the account to pay their childrens school 
fees and provided the documentary evidence to support what they said. I accept that 
NatWest did release the funds in time for the fees to be paid. But I think that it could have 
confirmed that it would do this at the time Mrs A and Mr A made their request, or offered an 
alternative such as transferring the necessary funds to the school on Mrs A and Mr As 
behalf.  
I think that the failure to provide the necessary reassurance, or offer alternative options 
caused Mrs A and Mr A distress and inconvenience. And this means that I think NatWest 
failed to treat Mrs A and Mr A fairly and reasonably. As this is the case, I think that NatWest 
should pay Mrs A and Mr A £100 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience its 
actions caused.  
Overall and having considered everything, while Im satisfied that NatWest was entitled to 
close Mrs A and Mr As account, I think it failed to provide the necessary reassurance or 
alternative options when told about the need to release the finds in the account for Mrs A 
and Mr As school fees. So Im partially upholding Mrs A and Mr As complaint and telling 
NatWest to pay Mrs A and Mr A £100 in compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mrs A and Mr As complaint. National 
Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mrs A and Mr A £100 in compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A and Mr A to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
