The complaint
Mr E complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Finance, 
has terminated the hire purchase agreement under which a used car was supplied to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr E had agreed in the hire purchase agreement that he signed in November 2016 to 
make 49 monthly payments of £496.71 to Audi Finance for the car;
he didn't make all of the payments that were due so his account went into arrears 
and Audi Finance sent arrears letters and default notices to him;
he paid £1,490.13 to clear his arrears in September 2018 but further payments were 
missed;
he contacted Audi Finance about his financial difficulties and it sent him an income 
and expenditure form in November 2018, which he completed;
a reduced repayment plan was agreed in February 2019 under which he would pay 
£149.02 for ten months from March 2019 and a copy of the plan was sent to him;
he didn't make the payment due in March 2019 because he said that he thought that 
the plan started in April 2019 - so Audi Finance reissued the plan to Mr E for him to 
make ten monthly payments of £149.02 from April 2019;
Mr E didn't make the payments so Audi Finance terminated the agreement in early 
May 2019 - but Mr E had been sent a letter giving him seven days to pay the arrears 
so it says that it gave him until the end of that month to pay the arrears of £1,986.91;
no payment had been received from Mr E by the agreed date (which Audi Finance 
extended twice) so it confirmed the termination of the agreement;
Mr E paid it the arrears of £1,986.91 in June 2019 - but his agreement had been 
terminated;
Mr E hadn't made the payments that had been agreed and I'm not persuaded that 
there's enough evidence to show that Audi Finance acted unfairly or unreasonably in 
its response to his arrears;
when it terminated the agreement it had given Mr E seven days to pay the arrears - 
so it had given him incorrect and inconsistent information - but it gave him additional 
time to make a payment to it (but he didn't do so);
that incorrect and inconsistent information is likely to have caused some distress and 
inconvenience to Mr E - and Audi Finance has agreed to pay him £100 
compensation;I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that Audi Finance acted 
incorrectly when it terminated Mr E's agreement; and
I don't consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Audi Finance to reinstate the agreement - or to take any other action in 
response to Mr E's complaint (other than paying him the £100 compensation).
I understand that Mr E still has the car but hasn't made the required payments to Audi 
Finance. I suggest that he contacts it to try to agree an affordable repayment plan for the 
amount that he owes to it - otherwise I consider that it's likely that it will take further action 
against him (to the extent that it's legally entitled to do so).
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Audi Finance to pay Mr E £100 to compensate 
him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused as a result of the incorrect and 
inconsistent information that he was given in May 2019 about the termination of his 
agreement.  
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Es complaint in part and I order 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Finance, to pay him £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2020.
