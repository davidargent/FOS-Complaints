The complaint
Miss S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) recorded a 
Country Court Judgement (CCJ) for someone else on her credit file.  
What happened
In April 2021 Miss S contacted TransUnion and complained after she found a CCJ in her 
sisters name on her credit file. Miss S has explained she was applying for a mortgage at the 
time and the CCJ caused serious problems. TransUnion issued a final response a week later 
that said it was investigating. TransUnion rejected Miss S complaint. 
Miss S referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. In August 
2021 the investigator asked TransUnion to provide supporting evidence including a 
complaint summary, copy of the information Miss S was disputing and confirmation of 
whether it had been removed from her credit file. The investigator also asked TransUnion to 
provide evidence to show details on Miss S credit file including searches that may have 
been completed. TransUnion didnt respond with all the information requested. 
Miss S has told us the CCJ was deleted at the end of May 2021 after she was able to get 
TransUnion to accept it belonged to her sister. And Miss S has told us she had to contact 
TransUnion repeatedly to get the CCJ removed and that it refused to offer reasonable 
assistance. In addition, Miss S has explained she had to liaise with the estate agents and 
solicitors involved in her house purchase to try and stop the property being marketed again. 
The investigator upheld Miss S complaint and recommended it pay £500 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused. TransUnion responded to say it didnt agree but its response didnt 
say why. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the investigator has said, TransUnion has only provided limited information to support its 
case. Weve got a copy of Miss S complaint email, TransUnions acknowledgement, a 
chaser email and a final response. I note the final response rejected Miss S complaint 
despite being unable to explain why the CCJ was showing on her credit file and explaining it 
was being investigated. Its very unclear from the information TransUnion has given us what 
it did after Miss S raised concerns about the CCJ entry. 
Miss S has given us an idea of how her sisters CCJ impacted her. Miss S has told us: 
- a mortgage application was declined
- the stress caused her to stop eating and insomnia
- she had to take steps to stop the property being sold to someone else 
- the level of time and input it took the resolve the situation impacted her work
- the CCJ impacted her ability to renew finance on her vehicle which meant she had to 
borrow a car
- the issues raised caused a substantial level of distress and inconvenience
Ive seen an email from Miss S mortgage broker that confirms her application was declined 
by the lender due to her credit score. As TransUnion didnt send any evidence from Miss S 
credit file, weve relied on screen prints she was able to provide. The CCJ entry clearly 
shows the name recorded doesnt belong to Miss S. Im satisfied theres sufficient 
information available to show the CCJ was recorded on Miss S credit file in error and that it 
didnt belong to her. And Im satisfied that did cause a reasonable level of trouble and upset 
for Miss S. 
The investigator upheld Miss S complaint and asked TransUnion to pay her £500. 
TransUnion didnt accept, but it didnt tell the investigator why or provide any other 
information to show it had dealt with Miss S fairly. Ive independently considered Miss S 
complaint and Im satisfied the information Ive seen indicates the wasnt hers so shouldnt 
have been reported on her credit file. And its clear from the information weve been given 
that the CCJ entry did have a serious impact on Miss S and her mortgage application. I dont 
doubt what Miss S has told us about the difficulties she encountered as a result of the CCJ 
along with the level of distress it caused. 
Based on the information Ive seen, Im upholding Miss S complaint and directing 
TransUnion to pay her £500. In my view, that figure fairly reflects the impact of the CCJ 
recorded on Miss S credit file and the level of distress and inconvenience caused to her. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited to 
pay Miss S £500.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 February 2022.
