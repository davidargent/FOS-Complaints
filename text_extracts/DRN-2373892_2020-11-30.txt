The complaint
Miss M complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) has failed to account for, to her 
satisfaction, £95,266.45 of withdrawals made from her current account between 20 April and 
16 May 2018.
What happened
Miss Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Barclays 
had made no errors in the administration or management of her current account between 
20 April and 16 May 2018. In other words, she was satisfied that all the withdrawals that had 
been made had been made by, or authorised by, Miss M.
Miss M didnt agree and so her complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same conclusion as the investigator and 
for the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been 
said.
Notwithstanding that Miss M hasnt said what specific withdrawals debited to her current 
account between 20 April and 16 May 2018 she feels are, or remain, unaccounted for I can 
confirm that Ive seen insufficient evidence to conclude that any of them were made without 
Miss Ms knowledge or authorisation.
It also appears that Miss M might be of the understanding that she received into her current 
account £96,101.40 from one or more third parties between 20 April and 16 May 2018 and 
£95,266.45 is what Barclays is saying she spent in the same period.
But contrary to what Miss M might understand she neither received £96,101.40 from third 
parties nor did she spend £95,266.45.
Having looked at Miss Ms current account and savings account between 20 April and 
16 May 2018 its my understanding that the following transactions took place:
20 April 2018 £55,498 received from a third party (1 transaction)
25 April 2018 £50,000 transferred to savings account (1 transaction)
27 April to 11 May 2018 £35,200 transferred from savings account (33 transactions)
So, although Miss M is correct in her understanding that between 20 April and 16 May 2018, 
she received £96,101.40 into her current account and withdrew £95,266.45 from it - £35,200 
of the receipts to the current account were internal transfers and not new money from third 
parties and £50,000 of the withdrawals was an internal transfer to Miss Ms savings account 
and not spent from the current account.
For the sake of completeness, I would also add that having considered what both parties 
have said and submitted in respect of Miss Ms savings account Im satisfied that this 
account has been correctly administered and managed by Barclays and the recorded 
balance now of £nil is correct in all material respects.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 December 2020.
