The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as A, is unhappy with various aspects of the service it 
received from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding the transferal of its 
business relationship to NatWests Global Restructuring Group (GRG).
What happened
A is a property development and investment business. In 2003, A refinanced existing 
borrowing and moved it to NatWest, which provided financing to A secured against 
properties owned by A and also by guarantees provided by As directors and owners.
In 2008, because of the difficult economic and market conditions present at that time, As 
financial position began to deteriorate. NatWest became concerned about As deteriorating 
financial position and in September 2009 it appointed a Specialist Relationship Manager 
(SRM) to oversee its relationship with A. Then, in December 2009, NatWest transferred As 
business relationship with it to the GRG.
A wasnt happy with how NatWest managed the business relationship following the transfer 
to the GRG, and so it raised a complaint which included that:
There had been misleading communication about the transfer to GRG and there was 
no proper justification for an alleged deterioration in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio 
that led to the transfer. A have said that it had negotiated the removal of all LTV 
covenants and replaced them with an income-to-interest-on-debt-servicing covenant 
only, and that the valuations that led to the LTV calculation werent based on 
professional estimates
There was a failure to support A in a manner consistent with good turnaround 
practice, and that GRG failed to engage in constructive dialogue with A and instead 
focussed solely on debt reduction.
That the actions of NatWest exacerbated As cash flow issues and significantly 
worsened As position. A has expressed concerns about a series of short-term 
lending facilities that NatWest put in place rather than medium or long-term lending 
facilities. A has also complained about an increase in interest margin in March 2009, 
which given that one of the reasons for the transfer to GRG in December 2009 was a 
concern that A would have difficulty servicing its borrowing, only exacerbated the 
issue.
There was a lack of transparent strategy from NatWest in its support for A, including 
that NatWest took an inflexible position regarding As overdraft facility and the 
withdrawal of promised funding for one of As projects. A also complaint that NatWest 
forced them to sell two properties at another project site, resulting in a loss of capital 
growth and income.
NatWest looked at As complaint as it related to how NatWest had managed the business 
relationship following the transfer to GRG. But NatWest didnt feel that it had acted unfairly 
towards A in how it had managed the business relationship following the transfer to GRG, 
and so it didnt uphold As complaint.
A wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so it appealed its complaint to an Independent 
third Party (ITP). But the ITP also didnt feel that NatWest had acted unfairly towards A, 
and so didnt uphold As complaint.
A remained dissatisfied, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of our investigators 
looked at this complaint. However, they also didnt feel that NatWest had acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in how it had managed the business relationship with A following the transfer 
to GRG, and so they also didnt uphold As complaint.
A didnt agree with the view of the complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, its apparent that there are several aspects of As complaint that are outside 
the remit of what Im able to consider here. Specifically, they relate to events that occurred 
before the transferral of the business relationship to the GRG.
For instance, A have complained about an increase in interest margin applied by NatWest 
that took place in March 2009, as well as that NatWest forced it to sell two properties in 
February and June 2009 which resulted in a loss of capital growth and income for A. 
While I can appreciate As concerns in regard to these points, my consideration of this 
complaint is limited to events surrounding the transferal of As business relationship to the 
GRG in December 2009, and the management of As business relationship by NatWest 
following the transfer to the GRG. And given that the events mentioned above took place 
before the transfer to the GRG and arent directly related to the transfer to the GRG, they fall 
outside the remit of what I can consider here.
Additionally, A have complained that NatWest changed its lending strategy to A, so as to 
only offer short-term facilities rather than medium or long-term lending. However, its clear 
that NatWests decision to offer short-term lending to A was taken before the appointment of 
the SRM in September 2009 and before the transfer to the GRG in December that same 
year. And so, for the same reasons explained above, Im satisfied that this isnt an aspect of 
As complaint that I consider here.
The aspects of As complaint that it is within my remit to consider are as follows:
There was misleading communication about the transfer to GRG and there was no proper 
justification for an alleged deterioration in the LTV that led to the transfer to GRG.
A have stated that it negotiated the removal of all LTV covenants with NatWest, and that 
these were replaced with an income-to-interest-on-debt-servicing covenant only. A also 
contend that the valuations that NatWest used for the LTV calculation werent based on 
professional estimates.In December 2009, in the GRG handover letter, NatWest confirmed to A why the transfer of 
the business relationship to GRG was taking place as follows:
a.loan to value position due to the general decline in market values,
b.ability to repay debt from net rental income, and
c.short term nature of the previously approved facilities against a longer-term hedge 
and business strategy
Its therefore evident that while NatWest did take the LTV into account when deciding to 
transfer As business relationship to GRG, that this wasnt the only factor in NatWest making 
that decision.
Additionally, I note an internal note written by NatWests credit department in September 
2008, which states:
Looking back on the file we have seen some serious deterioration in the cash 
position of the business where I am conscious that we have seen the o/d increase 
from £50k in June 2007 to £600k Feb 2008 pending asset sales which have not 
materialised and we are now requested to uplift to £700k notwithstanding the fact 
that we stipulated that £600k was a maximum.
As such it seems clear to me that, at the time of the transfer to GRG in December 2019, 
NatWest had had concerns about As deteriorating financial position for some time. 
Indeed, its apparent that NatWest had told A previously that it would be transferring its 
business relationship to the GRG in January 2009, but that that transfer was cancelled 
before it could be implemented when A proposed a solution to its financial problems which it 
appeared would allow A to meet its financial commitments to NatWest to NatWests 
satisfaction.
It's also notable that the SRM, when appointed, told NatWests credit team that a transfer to 
GRG should be undertaken because of concerns over security cover and As ongoing ability 
to service its debt to NatWest.
So while it is apparent that NatWest did consider the LTV as a factor in its decision to 
transfer As business relationship to the GRG, its clear that this wasnt the only factor, and 
that NatWest had held wider concerns regarding As financial position for some time. And 
given the significant deterioration in property values that had occurred because of the 2008 
financial crisis, I feel that NatWests position here was tenable regardless of whether recently 
instructed property valuations had been used in their considerations or not.
Additionally, given that by the time of the transfer to the GRG, NatWest had already 
amended As borrowing to an interest only repayment basis, it seems evident that NatWests 
concerns included As income-to-interest-on-debt-servicing covenant  as per point (b) on 
the italicised quotation from the handover letter above. 
Ultimately, I dont feel that NatWests communication about the transfer to the GRG was 
misleading and Im satisfied that there was a reasonable justification for NatWest to effect 
the transfer given what I feel were reasonable concerns that NatWest held about As 
financial position at that time. And as such, I wont be upholding this aspect of As complaint.
NatWest failed to support A in a manner consistent with good turnaround practice.A has complained that following the transfer into the GRG, NatWest failed to engage in 
constructive dialogue with them and concentrated instead solely on A reducing its 
outstanding debts. A believes that there was a lack of restructuring proposals and a lack of 
transparency from NatWest as to its attitude and support in regard to A, and A makes 
particular note of what it feels was a lack of flexibility from NatWest in regard to its overdraft 
facility.
At the time of the transfer to GRG in December 2009, there was already some disagreement 
between A and NatWest as to how best to proceed regarding As outstanding borrowing. 
This included that As previously existing facilities with NatWest had expired in June 2009 
and that A had refused to sign the new facility agreements put forwards by NatWest because 
of the proposed pricing increase and renewal fees.
In January 2010, shortly after the transfer to GRG, A proposed that it repay its outstanding 
borrowing to NatWest over a twenty-five year period, and the proposal included a profit-
share agreement with NatWest for one of As projects.
In response, NatWest made a counter proposal that included splitting As portfolio into two 
groups, broadly categorised as hold and develop/refinance. A didnt agree with this 
proposal, but it demonstrates that NatWest were making active suggestions to A as to how it 
could arrange for the servicing and repayment of its debts to NatWests satisfaction.
It's also notable that NatWest were actively engaged with A throughout much of 2011 when 
both A and NatWest made several amendments and counter proposals to a proposal initially 
put forwards by A. No agreement could be reached, and in March 2012 NatWest set out 
options for a longer-term strategy which included the appointment of a Fixed Charge 
Receiver to sell As property assets so that the outstanding borrowing could be repaid.
Im aware that A feels that NatWest had an unreasonable focus on A reducing its 
outstanding balance with NatWest during this period. But taking the full circumstances of As 
financial position at that time into consideration, I dont feel that it was unreasonable for 
NatWest to want A to work towards reducing the amount of borrowing it had outstanding.
One of the reasons I say this is because A hadnt been able to cover the interest payments 
that were due on the borrowing for approximately two years by that time. As such, and in 
consideration of As wider financial position, I dont feel that it was unreasonable for NatWest 
to have had a heightened perception of risk or to have had concerns about the potential 
recoverability of its financial outlay to A, so as to have wanted A to reduce or fully repay the 
outstanding borrowing as a matter of urgency.
I also dont feel that NatWest failed to support A in the manner in which A alleges here, and 
this is because it seems apparent that NatWest did engage with A and did make various 
proposals and counter proposals to A. I also feel that its notable that NatWest didnt default 
As position when it was first entitled to do so, or for a considerable period afterwards, but 
continued to work with A in an attempt to find a plan to progress the ongoing situation that 
was agreeable to both parties.
Furthermore, I feel that NatWest was transparent in its communication and correspondence 
with A as to its position and intentions regarding the outstanding facilities. And given that 
NatWest were the lender in the business relationship, I feel that they were entitled to insist 
that any proposals for progress were amenable to them, including that NatWest were 
reluctant to increase As overdraft further during that time. It follows therefore that I wont be 
upholding this aspect of As complaint.
NatWest exacerbated As cash flow issues and significantly worsened Ss position.This aspect of As complaint relates primarily to increases in the interest rate implemented 
by NatWest before the transfer of the business relationship to GRG in December 2009. As 
mentioned earlier in this letter, this matter sits outside the remit of what I can consider here, 
and so I wont be commenting on this point further.
However, I have considered the margins applied to As borrowing following the transfer into 
the GRG in December 2009, and having done so I havent seen anything that would give me 
cause for concern or which I feel can be considered an unfair or unreasonable margin 
amount. Accordingly, I wont be upholding this aspect of As complaint.
NatWest reneged on a promise it had made to A to provide funding for one of As projects.
In 2005, NatWest provided funding for A to develop a property. The loan to A had an expiry 
date of June 2009, and the property was held as security by NatWest. 
Continuing funding for the project was discussed in November 2008, and while no recording 
or transcript of the conversation between A and NatWest appears to exit, NatWests notes 
suggest that it was asked by A to consider providing continuing finance to A on a joint 
venture basis.
In September 2009, following the appointment of the SRM, NatWest told A that it wouldnt 
provide 100% of the continuing finance requested by A. Its notable that while the SRM felt 
that As proposal had some merit and was worthy of consideration, its apparent that 
NatWests credit department didnt feel that the proposal was acceptable to them.
This doesnt seem unreasonable to me given that as explained earlier NatWest had had 
concerns about As financial position for some time at that point, and that these concerns 
had led to NatWest appointing an SRM. 
It also must be noted that while A may recall promises being made verbally by NatWest 
regarding the provision of continuing finance, no written record of such promises appear to 
exist, and I havent seen any notes or correspondence that confirm that NatWest agreed to 
provide full funding to A as A contends here. As such, I wont be upholding this aspect of As 
complaint.
Summary
Ultimately, given the difficulties encountered by A as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, I 
feel it was reasonable for NatWest to have had a heightened perception of risk in regard to 
As ability to repay its borrowing to them. Consequently, having considered all the 
information provided to this service by both A and NatWest here, I dont feel that NatWest 
acted unfairly or unreasonably towards A in the manner in which A alleges.
On this basis, I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further 
action at this time. I realise this likely wont be the outcome A was wanting, but I trust it will 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or reject my decision before 15 June 2022.
