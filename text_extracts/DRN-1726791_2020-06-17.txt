The complaint
Mr S is complaining about charges being sought from him by LeasePlan UK Limited 
(LeasePlan) following his return of a car that had previously been on hire to him.
What happened
In October 2016 Mr S entered into a hire agreement (agreement) with LeasePlan.
In November 2018 Mr S returned the car. The car was inspected for damage and a report 
produced. This report identified damages (beyond fair wear and tear) of £515.15.
In November 2018 LeasePlan invoiced Mr S for damages (beyond fair wear and tear) of 
£465.15 including £70 for a damaged alloy.
Mr S complained to LeasePlan about the damage charges of £465.15. In summary he said 
that he had been advised, prior to entering into the agreement, that there would be no return 
damage charges payable for scratched and scuffed alloy wheels, only for buckled alloy 
wheels. And it was on the strength of this advice that he entered into the agreement. In other 
words, had he been advised (correctly) that there might be return damage charges for 
scratched and scuffed alloy wheels he wouldnt have entered into the agreement.
In February and July 2019 LeasePlan wrote to Mr S to say that it stood by the return charges 
of £465.15 that it was seeking to recover from him.
In September 2019, and unhappy with LeasePlans response, Mr S referred a complaint to 
our service.
Mr S complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
LeasePlan was entitled to seek £465.15 from Mr S and that Mr S should consider accepting 
LeasePlans offer, made whilst the complaint was with our service, to seek only £395.15 
from him, a reduction of £70 in respect of a damaged alloy wheel.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigators conclusion but said he was prepared to pay 
LeasePlan £250.00 instead.
LeasePlan didnt accept Mr S counter offer of settlement so the complaint has been passed 
to me for review and decision.
DRN-1726791What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr S, but Ive reached much the same conclusion as the investigator 
and for broadly the same reasons. 
I would also add that where the parties disagree, Ive made my findings on the balance of 
probabilities - in other words, what I think is most likely based on the evidence Ive seen and 
the wider circumstances. 
Mr S says that before he entered into the agreement he was advised that there would be no 
return damage charges for scratched and scuffed alloy wheels. And this advice was critical 
in his decision to enter into the agreement.
Now I know I cant say for certain what Mr S was or wasnt told in this respect, if anything. 
But taking everything into account Im not persuaded, on balance, that Mr S was misled as 
he submits. I say this given that what Mr S says he was told isnt LeasePlan policy (or the 
policy of the market more generally) and given that I might have expected to see such a 
representation committed in writing at one or both parties insistence.
I would also add that even if was to accept that Mr S was misled as he says (and as I say 
above I dont), Im simply not persuaded this advice was critical, or even key, to his decision 
to enter the agreement. 
But in any event, its my view that this particular point isnt material to my consideration of 
this complaint because LeasePlan isnt seeking from Mr S, at least now, anything for a 
scratched or scuffed alloy, or alloys.
Lastly on this particular point I would add that Im not surprised that LeasePlan is unable to 
provide, more than two years after the event, any call recordings of conversations that may 
or may not have taken place between it and Mr S.
Ive looked at the agreement Mr S signed. Im satisfied this says he agreed to return the car 
in good condition and any damage beyond fair wear and tear is his responsibility. Ive also 
considered the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) guidance and the 
inspection report.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ive summarised below the inspection report findings and the sums sought by LeasePlan, 
both initially and subsequently.

8 OSF Door
Scratch to Primer - Multiple£143.00 £93.00 £93.00
     
 Total £515.15 £465.15 £395.15
 
The investigator concluded that LeasePlan was entitled to seek from Mr S £465.15, this 
being in respect of items 1,2,3,5,7 and 8 in the above table. But LeasePlan said it was 
prepared to accept £395.15, this being in respect of items 1,2,3,7 and 8.
On the other hand Mr S said he should only have to pay £214.15 for items 2 and 3 in the 
above table plus say £35.85 (bringing the total to £250). But not the £181.00 for 
items 1,7 and 8.
 
 Ive carefully considered all of the damage charges that the investigator concluded that 
LeasePlan could reasonably seek payment of, with the exception of the NSF alloy rim 
charge which LeasePlan has confirmed its no longer  as a gesture of goodwill  seeking 
payment of and the front bumper and NS mirror housing charges which Mr S agrees are 
payable. And having done so, I can confirm that Im in agreement that these are all payable.
Ive come to the view having considered the photographs that have been provided which, in 
my view, show scratches to the bonnet and the NSR and OSF doors that constitute damage 
beyond what is deemed, by the BVRLA, as acceptable. 
So in summary I think its entirely reasonable for LeasePlan to charge Mr S, and seek 
recovery from him, the sum of £395.15. But I would remind it that if Mr S is experiencing 
financial difficulties then its required to treat him in a positive and sympathetic manner when 
doing so.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that in having agreed to accept from Mr S the 
sum of £395.15, LeasePlan UK Limited need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15July2020.
