The complaint
Mr R complains that British Gas Insurance Limited is responsible for causing damage in 
connection with a home emergency insurance policy.
What happened
Where I refer to British Gas, I refer to the insurance company of that name and I include 
other companies and individuals insofar as I hold that insurance company responsible for 
their actions.
Mr R had a British Gas policy that covered an annual boiler service and most central heating 
repairs. He complained that during a service on 7 March 2019 British Gas accidentally 
caused a leak, resulting in damage to his home.
British Gas apologised to Mr R and offered him £150.00 compensation on 20 June 2019. 
Unhappy with that, Mr R brought his complaint to us in July 2019. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that the 
amount of compensation British Gas had offered was enough.
Mr R disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
 £250.00 to him and £250.00 to charity could be the fairest solution.
This episode has cost him time money & stress.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept Mr Rs statement that his bathroom was re-fitted in September 2017. I accept the 
statement of British Gas that he had a bath with an access door.
I note that Mr R had surgery in February 2019.
I find that on 7 March 2019 British Gas was responsible for running a hot tap into the bath 
without checking that its door was properly closed. I find that careless. Water ran out onto 
the floor, through a light fitting in the ceiling below and onto the carpet of the lounge/dining 
room.
Im sorry to hear that on 17 March 2019 Mr R had an emergency admission to hospital 
where he remained until 3 April 2019. But I havent seen any medical evidence to show that 
the leak was a causal factor in this. 
British Gas was slow to respond to the leak. But it sent someone to inspect the carpet on 30 
May 2019. He reported that as well as damage from the leak there was pet damage. Mr R 
hasnt said otherwise.
On 5 June 2019 British Gas offered £75.00.
On about 12 June 2019 Mr R paid £54.00 for a report from a plumber. But that didnt add 
any further information.
On 20 June 2019 British Gas increased its offer to £150.00 which it confirmed in its final 
response dated 2 August 2019.
Overall Im satisfied that this was a fair and reasonable amount to compensate Mr R for the 
damage and associated distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I direct British Gas Insurance Limited 
to pay Mr R (insofar as it hasnt already done so) £150.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 September 2020.
