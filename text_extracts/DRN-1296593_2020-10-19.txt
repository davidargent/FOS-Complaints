The complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that National Westminster Bank Plc treated them unfairly when they 
applied for an interest rate product. They ask for compensation, including the cost of the 
brokers fee they incurred.
What happened
Mr and Mrs G had a mortgage with a bank in the same group as NatWest. Their interest rate 
product was coming to an end in mid-2019. They were unhappy with the rates their lender 
offered them and decided to look elsewhere. 
Mr and Mrs G applied to NatWest, but were told they werent eligible for the interest rate 
product they wanted. NatWest said this was because they had a mortgage with a lender in 
the same group and the product they applied for was only for new customers. Mr and Mrs G 
say NatWests website didnt explain this, which meant they wasted time applying.
Mr and Mrs G then re-applied through a broker and NatWest offered them the interest rate 
product theyd previously asked for. However, they had to pay a brokers fee of £995.
Our investigator said NatWest was entitled to make a commercial decision to offer certain 
interest rate products only to new customers, which meant Mr and Mrs G werent eligible for 
the product they wanted. It was unclear how they came to be offered this rate when they 
applied through the broker. But as NatWest hadnt treated them unfairly, the investigator 
didnt uphold their complaint. 
Mr and Mrs G didnt agree. In summary, Mr G said we hadnt addressed his concerns about 
the unfair and unequal access to mortgage products. In particular, that existing customers 
were required to incur broker fees to access the rate they wanted. He said this was an unfair 
relationship contrary to consumer legislation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has told us that it has separate mortgage product ranges for existing customers, 
new direct customers, and applications through brokers. Lenders are able to make a 
commercial decision about the products they offer, and its not unusual for lenders to offer 
different products to existing or new customers, or for some products to be offered only 
through brokers. I cant reasonably find that NatWest did anything wrong in offering a 
product intended only for new customers. However, Mr and Mrs G are unhappy about how 
this affected them, and I need to consider whether NatWest treated them fairly. In doing so, 
Ive taken the following into account.
NatWest offered an interest rate product only to new customers, which it says are those who 
dont have a mortgage with a lender in the same group. As Mr and Mrs G werent new 
customers, they werent eligible for the product. I appreciate Mr and Mrs G are unhappy 
about this, but I cant reasonably say NatWest made an error when it said they werent 
eligible for the product.
Mr and Mrs G went to a broker. They had to pay a fee to the broker, for the advice and 
services it provided, including searching the market on their behalf for the best rates. As it 
turned out, the NatWest product was the most competitive and the broker applied to 
NatWest on Mr and Mrs Gs behalf. 
It seems NatWest wrongly treated Mr and Mrs G as new customers when their broker 
applied for the mortgage. This allowed them to secure the interest rate product they wanted. 
From what its told us, NatWest didnt intend for existing customers to be able to access the 
interest rate product through a broker. I havent seen anything to suggest NatWest wanted to 
force Mr and Mrs G to incur brokers fees to secure the product they wanted. It says, as 
existing customers, Mr and Mrs G werent eligible for the interest rate product regardless of 
whether they applied directly or through a broker.
I understand that, from Mr and Mrs Gs point of view, it would have been easier and cheaper 
if theyd been allowed to take out the interest rate product directly. But I dont think its fair 
and reasonable to require NatWest to compensate them for the cost of the brokers fee, 
simply because they were able to secure an interest rate they were not eligible for  and 
which they now benefit from.
Mr G says the information on NatWests website is misleading and it should explain that 
products arent available to existing customers of other banks in the group. Mr and Mrs G 
spent time applying for a product, not realising theyd be treated as existing customers and 
so werent eligible for it. NatWest sent shopping vouchers worth £50 as a gesture of goodwill 
for the upset and trouble Mr and Mrs G experienced. I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
require NatWest to pay further compensation. 
Mr G says NatWest acted in breach of consumer legislation. Only a court can decide if this is 
the case. I dont think NatWest treated Mr and Mrs G unfairly. But if Mr and Mrs G dont 
accept my decision, theyll be free to take the matter to court if they want to do so. If Mr and 
Mrs G remain concerned that NatWests website is misleading they can consider contacting 
the regulator (the Financial Conduct Authority).
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G and Mr G to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 November 2020.
