The complaint
Mrs V says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her irresponsibly.  
What happened
I sent both parities my provisional decision on 27 March 2020 and asked them to let me 
know if they had any further comments. In my provisional decision I said:
"Mrs V had 32 instalment loans with Sunny. I've summarised some information Sunny

An adjudicator considered Mrs V's complaint and thought it should be upheld in part. She 
didn't think Sunny should have approved loans 5 to 32. Sunny didn't accept this but did 
agree to uphold the complaint from loan 23 onwards. Sunny's offer was put to Mrs V but she 
didn't accept it. As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach 
to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs V could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs V could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Vs complaint. 
As I've summarised above, I think in the early stages of the lending relationship, less through 
checks are likely to be reasonable and proportionate. Looking at loans 1 to 8, for the most 
part I think Sunny's affordability checks were proportionate. It was reasonable in these early 
stages of the leading relationship for Sunny to rely more heavily on Mrs V's self-declared income and expenditure and checks like these are unlikely to suggest a loan was 
unaffordable in Mrs V's circumstances.
I do think however that Sunny's checks should have gone further for loan 8. Loans 7 and 8 
overlapped, meaning Mrs V borrowed a total of £400 in June 2017 - which was similar to the 
cumulative amounts Mrs V had previously borrowed. This suggested Mrs V had a continuos 
hole in her finances every month, rather than just a short-term need to borrow. This means it 
was less likely future lending would be sustainable and so it was no longer reasonable for 
Sunny to place as much weigh on Mrs V's declared income and expenditure. So I think 
Sunny ought to have looked more closely at Mrs V's financial situation, obtaining some form 
of further proof to support what Mrs V told it about her income and expenditure. This said, I 
don't have any information from Mrs V which suggests loan 8 was actually unaffordable, so I 
do not intend to uphold the complaint about it.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs V, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances Mrs Vs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs V was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs V had taken out 8 loans within five months and Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs V was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Loan 9 was for £400, about the same amounts as Mrs V previously borrowed when 
taking into account that her loans overlapped (e.g. loan 1, then loans 3 and 4 and 
then 7 and 8). At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mrs V was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need.
From loan 9 onwards Mrs V was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. As Sunny acknowledged in its final response letter, there 
were no substantial gaps between the loans.
Mrs V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 
32 was taken out over two years after Mrs V's first. And, together with loan 31, was 
for the same amount. Mrs V had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mrs V lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
9 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Vs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs V borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im planning to uphold the complaint about loans 9 to 32."
Mrs V accepted my provisional findings. Sunny didn't. It referred me back to its offer to 
uphold the complaint from loan 23 and also said it didn't think Mrs V had paid a significant 
amount of interest as the interest she paid was around 23% of the principal borrowed. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I looked again at Sunny's offer to uphold the complaint from loan 23. Broadly speaking, I 
think Sunny's argument is that because all the checks it carried out suggested the loans 
were 'pounds and pence' affordable, it doesn't accept that it was wrong to lend to Mrs V. 
Although it does concede that, "...the manner in which [Mrs V] used our products may have 
indicated she was not, when looking at her usage overall, using the credit for short term 
borrowing needs. At the point at which her usage extended beyond 18 months, it is possible 
that she may have started to become reliant on the credit. As a result, from this point in time 
the lending to her may not have been sustainable."
So there is some concession that long-term use of high-cost short-term credit indicates that 
the lending may have become unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. But it's disappointing 
that Sunny's response suggests it hasn't learned from the many previous decisions it has 
had from this service about complaints like Mrs V's.
What Sunny has said hasn't persuaded me I should depart from my provisional findings. I 
find the point identified by Sunny as when the loans become potentially unsustainable 
comes long after Sunny ought to have stopped providing these loans to Mrs V.
From what I can see, Mrs V borrowed £400, almost consistently, from Sunny throughout the 
lending relationship. Loans 1; 3 and 4; 7 and 8; and 9 were all individually or cumulatively for 
£400 - which I assume is the internal credit limit Sunny set for Mrs V. This is then repeated 
for loans 10-13; 14 and 15; 16-19; 20-22; 23 and 24; 26 and 27; 28 and 29; and 31 and 32. 
As I said in my provisional decision, this lending took place over a period of more than two 
years. The only break during this time is between loans 15 and 16 but I do not think that 
break is significant in the overall context of the lending relationship. 
I think it's common ground that loans like those provided by Sunny are not intended to be 
used over the long term. As Sunny says on its website, "Our loans are ideal for short-term 
situations, so you will need to be in a position to repay the loan in a few months, or perhaps 
even by your next payday. Where they are not suitable is as a long-term solution to ongoing 
financial problems."
Loan 9 was approved seven months into the lending relationship and although the length of 
time here might not be particularly long in the context of instalment loans, it was clear that 
wasn't how Mrs V was utilising the credit available to her, as she was settling most of her 
loans within a month or two; akin to the term of a payday loan. Up until and including loan 9, 
Mrs V took out new loans within a day or a week of settling preceding loans. So I think it's 
reasonable to conclude, as I did in my provisional decision, that by this point Sunny ought to 
have realised Mrs V wasn't likely to have been settling her loans in a way which was 
sustainable.
Finally, Sunny doesn't think Mrs V paid large amounts of interest as the interest she paid 
was only 23% of what she borrowed. I didn't find in my provisional decision that this was the 
only reason Mrs V had lost out. But as I've found that Mrs V's loans were unsustainable - 
and that the lending should not have been permitted to go on for as long as it did, I do think 
that the £1,380 Mrs V paid in interest is a significant loss, which wouldn't have occurred had 
Sunny not lent to her irresponsibly.
I'm therefore upholding Mrs V's complaint in respect of loans 9 to 32, for the reasons given 
above and in my provisional decision.
Putting things rightSunny must:
refund all interest and charges Mrs V paid on loans 9 to 32 and ;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
The number of loans taken from 9 onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So Sunny must also remove all entries about loans 9 to 32 from Mrs V's credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs V a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mrs V's complaint in part. Elevate Credit International Limited must put things right 
by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs V to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 May 2020.
