The complaint
Mr A complains that NewDay Ltd didnt treat him fairly when he experienced financial
difficulties.
What happened
Mr A had a credit card account with NewDay. He experienced financial difficulties after a 
change in his personal circumstances which impacted on his health. He says he told 
NewDay about these problems, but it didnt assist him.
He says NewDay registered adverse information about his account with credit reference 
agencies. He says it also sold his debt to a third party and both NewDay and the third party 
have separately registered a default with credit reference agencies  even though it is for the 
same debt.
Mr A says hes experienced poor service from NewDay. Its continued to send letters to his 
old address after he told it he no longer lived there. He says this is a breach of data 
protection laws.
Mr A complained to NewDay. It had responded to issues which Mr A raised in May but it 
didnt respond to further issues which he raised with it after that date. So, Mr A complained 
to our service.
Our investigator looked into his complaint. She contacted NewDay and it apologised it hadnt 
responded to Mr A about all the issues hed raised with it. It said itd reviewed its file and no 
payments had been made to the account in the period from January 2019 to May 2019.
NewDay said it had put a hold on the account in March after Mr A told it about his personal 
circumstances. NewDay says that when a hold is placed on an account no interest or 
charges are applied to the account. But arrears will continue to accrue. Once the arrears 
reach a certain level a default may be registered on the account and in certain 
circumstances NewDay may also sell it to a third party.
NewDay says it wrote to Mr A and asked him to provide medical evidence to support what 
he had told it. When it spoke to him in May it says it became aware he had left his previous 
address. So, it gave him further time to provide the medical evidence. But, NewDay said it 
accepted that it shouldnt have lifted the hold on his account in June or passed his account 
to a debt collection agency. It says it paid him £50 in August by way of compensation for 
whatd happened.
NewDay accepts that in circumstances where Mr A had told it about his health issues, it also 
shouldnt have sold his account to a third party. It had done this in September.
In order to resolve the issues NewDay offered to bring the account back under its own 
administration. No interest would be charged on the account and it said it would try to agree 
a repayment plan with Mr A. NewDay also offered to pay a further £150 by way of 
compensation. It said it would set this off against his outstanding balance.
But it didnt agree to remove the default which had been registered at credit reference 
agencies.
Our investigator considered what NewDay had said. She said NewDay had done everything 
it was required to do in circumstances where it hadnt been able to make an arrangement 
with Mr A and he hadnt provided it with the medical evidence it had asked for. She agreed 
that the debt shouldnt have been sold to a third party and the hold shouldnt have been 
removed. But she said NewDay hadnt done anything wrong when it registered the default.
She didnt think NewDay should remove the default it had registered but she said it must 
make sure there were no duplicates registered. She said NewDay would need to liaise with 
all third parties involved to ensure that any duplicates were removed.
She also thought that the offer to pay Mr A a further £150 by way of compensation was fair 
and reasonable. She said it was entitled to set off the compensation payment against the 
debt.
Mr A didnt agree. He says its unfair to register the default. He also wants more
compensation for whats happened. And, he wants the compensation to be paid directly to 
him rather than be set off against his debt.
Because Mr A didnt agree the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in which I said: 
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset Id just point out that in this decision Im only dealing with the complaint 
Mr A has raised about how his account was managed after he experienced financial 
difficulties. I am aware that Mr A has raised other issues. Those need to be dealt with 
separately.
Ive looked at the actions which NewDay took after it became aware of Mr As 
personal and financial difficulties.
I can see that Mr A first made NewDay aware of his circumstances at the end of 
December 2018. At that time the account wasnt in arrears. So, NewDay didnt take 
any action until some time later. It tried to contact him in February but wasnt able to. 
It put his account on hold at that time. This meant no interest or charges would be 
applied to the account.
NewDay then wrote to Mr A in March and asked him to send it medical evidence to 
support what he had told it. But, Mr A didnt get this request because he had left his 
home. Mr A thinks NewDay has breached data protection laws by sending letters to 
an address when it knew, or ought to have known, he was no longer at that address.
Our investigator said we couldnt look into complaints about breaches of data 
protection laws. Complaints about data protection can be raised with the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO). I agree thats it not our role to determine whether 
theres been a breach of data protection laws. But, when considering whats fair and reasonable, we take into account the laws, regulations and circumstances of each 
case.
I dont think NewDay was aware that Mr A wasnt living at the address on its records 
until its Customer Care team spoke to him on 6 May 2019. In the meantime, a default 
notice had been issued. After he spoke to the Customer Care team NewDay put the 
hold back on his account. But I can see it removed the hold again in June because it 
hadnt received Mr As medical information. It received that in July 2019.
It is the case that in circumstances where Mr A had told NewDay about his personal 
and financial difficulties, wed expect it to treat him sympathetically and positively. So, 
I think NewDay is right when it says it shouldnt have removed the hold on Mr As 
account in June. When a hold is in place on an account no interest or charges are 
applied. But arrears will still accrue. And when the arrears reach a certain level a 
default will occur. Thats what happened here.
Mr A says NewDay shouldve agreed a payment arrangement with him. He says if it 
had done that then the default wouldnt have been registered and the debt wouldnt 
have been sold. Ive thought about what Mr A has said. But, having considered all the 
information recorded in NewDays notes on this case, I dont think Mr A wouldve 
been in a position to make a payment arrangement to clear the arrears on the 
account within a reasonable period of time.
I can see that Mr A started to make token payments to NewDay in May 2019  but 
these were not part of an agreed payment arrangement. So, the account defaulted.
In these circumstances, I dont think the expectation that NewDay should treat Mr A 
positively and sympathetically means that arrears shouldnt continue to accrue. And 
for that reason, I dont think NewDay did anything wrong when it registered the 
default with credit reference agencies.
Ive also thought about NewDays decision to sell the debt to a third party. The 
Standards of Lending Practice state that where a customer has provided evidence of 
an ongoing mental health or critical illness that affects his ability to repay his debts, 
the debts should not be sold. In this case Mr A had provided evidence of his ongoing 
health issues. So, in these circumstances, Im satisfied the debt shouldnt have been 
sold.
NewDay has accepted it shouldnt have sold the debt to a third party. Its offered to 
bring the account back under its administration. And, our investigator has told it she 
thinks that any duplicates of the default should be removed. I think thats fair and 
reasonable.
Ive also considered the compensation offered by NewDay. New Day says its 
already paid Mr A £50 by way of compensation and its offered to pay a further £150. 
I think the total amount of £200 is fair and reasonable compensation for the trouble 
and upset caused in this case.
NewDay thinks this compensation payment should be set-off against the debt which 
Mr A owes to it. Its already applied £50 in August 2019 by way of set-off against the 
debt. And, it proposes that the additional £150 should be applied in the same way.
Ive thought about what NewDay has said. The compensation is for trouble and upset 
which Mr A experienced as a result of the process which NewDay followed in this case. In these circumstances I think its fair and reasonable for that compensation to 
be paid directly to Mr A rather than be set off against the outstanding debt.
What I think should be done to put things right
In order to put things right I intend to require NewDay to take the following action:
Bring the account back under its administration;
Take all reasonable steps to ensure that any duplicates of the default entry on 
this account recorded at credit reference agencies are removed; and
Pay Mr A £200 by way of compensation for the trouble and upset hes been 
caused as a result of whats happened. This amount should be paid directly 
to Mr A and should not be set off against his debt. And, in these 
circumstances, NewDay may decide to reverse the compensation payment of 
£50 its already applied to Mr As account in August.
Mr A has responded to what I said in my provisional decision. He says that although the 
basic issues had been addressed, he didnt think the impact had been fully considered. In 
particular he said I should take into account the fact that, at the time, he was still dealing with 
issues associated with being a victim of a very serious and traumatic event. And it was 
against this background hed had to deal with NewDay  often having to spend hours on the 
telephone with it.
He also said hed prefer that the account wasnt returned to NewDays administration 
because he didnt want to have to deal with it. He said if it did go back to NewDays 
administration he wanted to have online access to his account. NewDay had said no interest 
or charges had been applied since June 2019, but hed not seen any statements and wasnt 
sure if this was correct.
NewDay responded to the provisional decision by saying it agreed to the actions proposed. It 
said that in order to remove the duplicate default, the account would have to be brought back 
under its administration. It said it couldnt provide online access to statements because of 
the account status. But it said copies of statements between June and September 2019 
could be made available to Mr A.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about what Mr A and NewDay said in response to my provisional decision.
I was very sorry to read about the issues Mr A has been dealing with after he was the victim 
of certain traumatic events. This was included in the information which had been provided to 
me before I made my provisional decision, and I had taken it into account. 
When dealing with this complaint I had to consider NewDayss actions and any distress or 
inconvenience its actions had caused Mr A. As I said in my provisional decision NewDay did 
make mistakes in this case. And, Mr A did have to spend time contacting it to try to get the 
issues resolved.
When an organisation makes mistakes its not our role to fine or punish it. We consider the 
impact the mistakes have had upon the particular person involved. In this case, I know Mr A 
was already going through a stressful time because of the traumatic experience hed had. 
But, although Mr A is disappointed with the amount of compensation I thought he should 
receive, I did take his circumstances into account when considering the distress and 
inconvenience he was caused by NewDays actions. Ive considered the actions NewDay took to try to resolve the matters associated with his 
account. As I said in my provisional decision, it shouldnt have removed the hold it had 
placed on the account. But I can see it hasnt applied any interest or charges to his account 
since June 2019. I also thought it shouldnt have sold the account to a third party. And, 
NewDay has accepted this and agreed to bring the account back under its own 
administration.
Ive also explained why I dont think NewDay did anything wrong when it recorded the default 
on his account. 
So, having considered everything here, I havent changed my view that £200 by way of 
compensation is fair and reasonable for the distress and inconvenience Mr A experienced as 
a result of the actions NewDay took. Ive also said this amount should be paid direct to Mr A 
and not used to reduce his outstanding balance.
NewDay has explained why it needs to bring the account back under its administration. It 
needs to do this to remove the duplicate default which the third party purchaser has 
registered. I understand Mr A would prefer he didnt have to deal with NewDay. But I think 
its important that the duplicate default is removed, and I cant require the third party which 
purchased the account to do that. It is not a party to this complaint.
NewDay should ensure Mr A is kept advised of the state of his outstanding account. It 
cannot provide online access, but it should be able to provide Mr A with the information he 
needs to keep track of his account, by other means. I think thats fair and reasonable.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I uphold this complaint about NewDay Ltd. I now require it to 
take the following action:
bring the account back under its administration;
take all reasonable steps to ensure that any duplicates of the default entry on 
Mr As account recorded at credit reference agencies are removed; and
pay Mr A £200 by way of compensation for the trouble and upset hes been 
caused as a result of whats happened. This amount should be paid directly 
to Mr A and should not be set off against his debt. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 November 2020.
