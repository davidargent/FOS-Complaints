The complaint
Mr K complains about instances of poor service provided by National Westminster Bank Plc.
What happened
Mr K told us he opened an online saver account, and only wanted statements sent 
electronically. But NatWest sent him paper statements. And Mr K said that when he rang to 
complain about this, someone hung up on him.
Mr K complained, and NatWest told him it accepted it had made some mistakes. It offered 
Mr K £45 to make up for that. Mr K didnt agree, but NatWest paid him anyway. Mr K says 
NatWest shouldnt have done that, because he wanted to complain to our service. He wants 
NatWest to pay him £175.
NatWest told our service it was sorry that Mr K had ended up with paper statements. It also 
said it was sorry that a call had dropped while Mr K was on the phone. It had paid him £40 in 
compensation, and £5.40 for call costs, which it put into his account. NatWest said that it had 
reviewed his complaint since he contacted us, and it thought it had done enough to make up 
for what had gone wrong. It wouldnt do any more. 
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. He thought that NatWest had acted fairly. But 
Mr K didnt agree. He didnt think NatWest shouldve paid him compensation for this 
complaint without him agreeing the outcome and amount.
Because Mr K didnt agree with our investigator, the case was passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not clear why Mr K received paper statements initially. NatWest says it isnt sure what 
went wrong, but it has apologised. And its also not clear if someone accidentally cut off Mr K 
or if the call just dropped. Its said sorry for that too. 
NatWest paid Mr K £40 in compensation for these issues, and £5.40 to cover his call costs. I 
know that Mr K would like a lot more for this complaint overall. But I think that provides a fair 
and reasonable outcome to this part of Mr Ks complaint. 
Mr K said that NatWest shouldnt have paid this money to him without agreeing this with him, 
because he wanted to take his complaint to our service. But, as NatWest is aware, a 
payment like this doesnt stop our service from considering a complaint. So I dont think that 
Mr K has lost out because NatWest just paid this money to him. I dont think it has to do 
anything to make up for this. I know that Mr K will be disappointed, but I think NatWests already done enough to make up 
for what went wrong here. And that means I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 May 2020.
