The complaint
Mrs M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) cancelled the wrong 
cheque.
What happened
Mrs M says she asked NatWest to cancel a cheque that hadnt been cashed some time after 
she wrote it. The cheque was for £1,980 and payable to a business I will call L. Mrs M says 
NatWest cancelled a different cheque which meant she had to travel to a branch to sort 
matters out. She also says a letter from NatWest about her complaint wasnt signed and 
says the compensation offer of £100 doesnt go far enough for what took place.
NatWest initially apologised for what took place and accepted it made a mistake. It sent Mrs 
M a gift and later offered £100 compensation. It also refunded the fee for cancelling a 
cheque. NatWest then reviewed the calls and says it cancelled the correct cheque and Mrs 
M gave incorrect cheque details.
Mrs M brought her complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest acted fairly by 
offering an appropriate compensation amount and by apologising. The investigator also 
thought NatWest fairly refunded the fee after telling Mrs M incorrectly there was no 
cancellation fee.
Mrs M doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mrs M will be disappointed by my decision. I make clear that we are not 
NatWests regulator and so its not our role to direct it to sign any letters it sends to 
customers.
I have listened to the telephone calls between the parties. Im satisfied that Mrs M was 
incorrectly told there was no cheque cancellation fee, but Im also satisfied NatWest has 
refunded that fee and apologised for how parts of this complaint were dealt with.
The key part of the complaint is the cheque cancellation. Having listened to the main call 
between the parties Im satisfied Mrs M provided details of the cheque she wished to cancel 
which ended 091 and that NatWest followed her instructions. I have looked at NatWests 
records and can see that Mrs M didnt provide the correct details and the cheque to L ended 
089. So, I dont think NatWest made a mistake in cancelling the cheque and think it 
cancelled the cheque that it was given details of. I dont think NatWest could have known 
that there was a mistake.
I dont think its clear why NatWest didnt realise what had happened at the time or why it 
apologised for something it wasnt responsible for. But I can see that NatWest has made an 
offer of £100 compensation which includes the mistakes it did make and its overall handling 
of this complaint. I will of course leave it to Mrs M to decide if she still wishes to accept that 
£100 compensation offer as I can see that she initially rejected it. I make clear that I think 
that compensation offer is fair and reasonable taking into account what I think about the 
cheque cancellation issue.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has now explained what took place and has made a fair and 
reasonable compensation offer. Mrs Ms acceptance of that offer would be in full and final 
settlement of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2022.
