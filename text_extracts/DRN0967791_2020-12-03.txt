K821x#15complaint
Ms B complains  about how NewDay Ltd (NewDay) have administered her credit card
account. Shes unhappy with how NewDay applied her repayments and believes this led to
her wrongly being charged interest.
background
Ms B holds a credit card with NewDay. In May 2018  she made a payment of £1,000  toward
her overall balance.
In advance of making  her repayment, Ms B had anticipated the way in which  it would be
applied. Her overall  balance  was made  up of three  different  balance  types, all at a
promotional 0% interest rate. Shed thought about which  balance  would be paid first, and
she had calculated how the £1,000 would be distributed.  But when she received her next
statement, Ms B found the repayment  hadnt  been applied as shed thought.  There  was still
a balance outstanding that Ms B thought  would  have been fully repaid. And she was now
being charged interest on it.
In June 2018 Ms B contacted NewDay to discuss the matter  but nothing  was resolved. She
then made  a formal  complaint to NewDay via its website.  NewDay sent its final response
letter to Ms B in August  2018. The final response letter  claimed the repayment had been
incorrectly allocated. NewDay apologised, refunded some  interest  and it paid Ms B some
compensation for the inconvenience.
Ms B continued speaking  with NewDay after it had sent her its final response letter. She said
she still didnt think the issue was resolved, and she wanted to wait until her next statement
to determine if things had been  fixed.  When Ms B received her next statement, she thought
the same  issue was occurring. As time went on, Ms B saw successive repayments being
allocated in a way she didnt think was correct.
In February 2019  Ms B approached our service.  She raised three main  areas  of concern that
she was unhappy  about; the allocation of her repayments, a decision by NewDay to reduce
her credit limit and a block which NewDay had applied  to her credit  card.
An adjudicator considered  Ms Bs complaint. In correspondence  with this service  NewDay
explained it had realised its final response  letter was wrong. It said Ms Bs May 2018
repayment had, in fact, been applied correctly. After his investigation,  the adjudicator
concluded that he didnt think NewDay had done anything  wrong.  He was satisfied Ms Bs
repayments had been allocated to the correct balances. He also didnt think NewDay had
acted unfairly or unreasonably when it reduced Ms Bs credit limit, or when it applied  a block
to Ms Bs account.
Ms B disagreed. She provided a detailed response  outlining where she thinks  the initial error
with her repayment took place, and calculations to show how her various  balances  should
have reduced with each subsequent repayment. She also explained that she received no
contact from NewDay when it blocked  her account. Ms B still thought the decision  to reduce
her credit limit was odd given it had increased her limit previously.
Ref: DRN09677912The adjudicator reconsidered but he didnt change his mind. He still thought  Ms Bs
repayments had been applied correctly.  He also maintained that NewDay hadnt done
anything wrong  when it applied the block to Ms Bs account, or that it acted unreasonably in
reducing her credit  limit.
Ms B still didnt agree. Her response  focussed  specifically  on the allocation of her
repayments. In summary, Ms B said that her repayment in May 2018 had been  misapplied,
and this had resulted in a chain of errors.
As an agreement couldnt  be reached the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision saying I intended to uphold the complaint. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
In support of her complaint Ms B has made  numerous detailed points. And Id like to 
pass on my sincere thanks to Ms B for her continued patience in this matter.
Ive summarised the complaint in far less detail,  and I havent commented on 
everything Ms B has raised. I dont intend  any discourtesy by this. Rather, it reflects 
the informal nature of this service.
In this case Ms B has raised multiple complaint  points. So, for clarity, Ive set out my 
findings to each separately.
The application of Ms Bs repayments
Ms B has been quite  clear that she thinks NewDay  made an error  in May 2018,  so 
Ive started at that point in time.
Ms Bs May 2018 statement shows three separate balances.  Two balance transfers, 
and one money transfer, which  were all charged  at a promotional  0% interest rate. 
Ms B thinks NewDay shouldve paid off one of the balance transfers first, because it 
carried the promotional  0% offer that was expiring soonest.
For me to determine if Ms Bs £1,000 repayment  was applied correctly,  Ive checked 
the terms and conditions that governed her account at the time.
Ive seen multiple sets of terms  and conditions for Ms Bs credit card account. 
NewDay has provided me with a copy of changes it made to the terms and conditions  
in August 2017. From what Ive seen, there were no further changes until November 
2018. Im satisfied, then,  that the terms and conditions  from August 2017 are 
applicable for the time period Im considering.
NewDay has said notification of these  updated terms were sent to Ms B alongside 
her July 2017 statement. Ive been  provided with a copy of that statement, and Ive 
seen the notice was indeed included.  So Im satisfied that Ms B was made aware.
Ref: DRN09677913The relevant  term explains that:
If interest is charged at the same  rate on different  balances,  we will use your
payment to pay off different balances in the following order: Cash transactions,
Money transfers, Balance transfers, other Promotional transactions, Payment
Protection Insurance, Purchases and other transactions. If you have more  than
one promotional transaction at the same  rate, your payment will be applied  first to
the Promotional transaction that has the earliest promotional  period start date.
Given the crux of this complaint,  its important to be clear on what this term means.  
Having considered it carefully, I think theres  two parts.  First, NewDays intention  is to 
show how it will apply  repayments if multiple  balances are charged  at the same 
interest rate. It does this by setting  out a specific order. Cash transactions  are repaid 
first, followed by money transfers  and so on.
Next, I think the term goes on to explain that within the order  it sets out, if there are 
multiple transactions of the same  type at the same rate, such  as two balance 
transfers both at 0%, then NewDay will apply repayment to whichever has the 
earliest start date first.
If I apply that approach  to Ms Bs credit card balance  in May 2018, it suggests  to me 
that her £1,000  repayment was correctly  allocated to the money transfer. I say this 
because while one of Ms Bs balance transfers  did have the promotional  0% interest 
rate which started  first, balance transfers  follow money transfers in the order NewDay 
sets out in its terms and conditions.  So, on that basis, Im not persuaded that 
NewDay made an error here.
Ms B has highlighted further instances  where she thinks NewDay  got things wrong. 
So Ive also looked at some of her subsequent repayments.
In June 2018, Ms B made a repayment of £245.  She was now being charged  interest  
on the balance  transfer she thought would have been cleared. So because  she was 
being charged interest, the term I set out above  doesnt apply.  In this scenario Id 
expect NewDay to allocate Ms Bs repayment  to the interest-bearing  balance.  And 
from what Ive seen,  thats what happened. So I dont think  NewDay  did anything 
wrong in regard to this repayment.
I should point  out that around this time in 2018, there was clearly some  manual 
intervention from NewDay  on Ms Bs account. The July 2018 statement shows  two 
balance transfers  had now merged together. It was now a single balance with a 
promotional 0% interest rate. Ive also seen that the remaining amount Ms B owed for 
a money transfer  had become a balance transfer,  with a promotional 0% interest  rate 
that now expired  some  two months  later than it did previously.
NewDay has said it cant explain why this happened. I think  its most likely the 
intervention was made because NewDay thought  it had misapplied Ms Bs May 2018 
repayment. But nonetheless, despite not being able to explain  things,  NewDay has 
said the changes  worked in Ms Bs favour  because she was no longer paying  any 
interest. And while an explanation of NewDays intervention here would certainly  
have been helpful, I do agree the amendments seem to have worked  in Ms Bs 
favour. 
Ref: DRN09677914So regardless of the reason, because  she was no longer being charged interest, 
Ms B had received some benefit as a result  of NewDays amendments to her overall  
balance. And it follows  that I can conclude she suffered no loss as a result.
Ive also looked  at Ms Bs August 2018 statement. It shows  me that Ms B made a 
repayment of £100.  Following NewDays intervention the previous month  each of her 
balances were now back to 0%, so the order of repayment set out in the terms and 
conditions would apply  again. As in May, Ms Bs repayment was allocated to the 
money transfer, which is what Id expect.  So I think  her repayment was also applied  
correctly in August  2018.
As a result of what Ive set out above,  Im satisfied  that Ms Bs repayments were 
applied correctly and in-line with the terms and conditions which  governed her credit  
card account  at the time.  I find the terms and conditions set out a specific  order  which  
NewDay did apply.
However, I think NewDays terms and conditions couldve been clearer. I can see 
that in Ms Bs mind,  she was managing her finances  meticulously. And from her 
correspondence with this service, Ms B has evidently put much time and effort into 
keeping on top of her NewDay credit  card.  So although Im satisfied NewDay  didnt 
make a mistake, given  the way its terms are worded I can surely understand why 
Ms B thinks differently.
I also think NewDays handling  of the matter has been confusing and misleading. 
This experience has clearly taken its toll on Ms B and damaged her trust in 
NewDays ability to administer her credit card properly. So Ive thought about the 
impact of NewDays actions to Ms B.
I think NewDays explanations have been  generally  unhelpful. Ms B had to spend a 
lot of time writing letters and speaking to NewDay on the phone, setting out her 
position in much detail.  NewDay  also gave Ms B wrong information when she 
complained, and this would  only have  strengthened  her belief that NewDay  had 
made a mistake.  I think  NewDay couldve done more to help Ms B understand how 
her credit card worked. But Ive not seen  that it took the time to do so. Im therefore 
satisfied Ms B has suffered distress and inconvenience in this matter and, 
considering what  Ive set out, I think £250  is a fair and reasonable amount of 
compensation to reflect  that. So NewDay should pay Ms B £250  in addition  to any 
compensation its already paid.
Ms Bs credit  limit
Ms B has said shes unhappy  with the decision to lower her credit limit. Shes  pointed  
out that NewDay had increased her limit previously, and thinks  the decision  was 
made as a result of her making a complaint.
Sometimes businesses  lower credit limits.  There can be several reasons for this and, 
in this case, NewDay has explained  that it took the decision  after Ms B hadnt used 
the card for spending for some time. Its also pointed to the terms and conditions of 
the credit  card,  which  it says allow it to change limits  at any time.
Ref: DRN09677915The terms and conditions  do indeed state  that NewDay can amend credit  limits. Ive 
also reviewed Ms Bs statements, and I can see the card hadnt  been used for 
spending for over six months before NewDay lowered the credit  limit. Ive seen 
nothing to suggest NewDays decision caused Ms B any difficulty, or that it caused 
her a loss. And Ive seen no evidence that Ms Bs credit limit was lowered directly as 
a result of her raising  a complaint. So, on balance, Im satisfied NewDays  decision to 
lower Ms Bs credit  limit was reasonable.
The block  applied to Ms Bs card
NewDay applied a block to Ms Bs credit card in 2018. Ms B has said she was 
unaware her card was blocked. Shes unhappy that she was only informed when she 
contacted NewDay  to make a balance transfer.
NewDay has explained that Ms Bs card was blocked because it was alerted to a 
potential compromise,  involving a specific merchant. Having checked the terms and 
conditions, NewDay can impose restrictions to prevent suspected fraud  or 
compromise. I can appreciate this might be frustrating. But Id expect NewDay to take 
security measures to protect  both itself and its customers, and it seems thats what it 
did here.
Ms Bs card was reissued  on the same day she called NewDay  about making a 
balance transfer.  So it appears NewDay sorted things out quickly once Ms B wanted 
to use her credit card. I appreciate that it mightve been helpful  if NewDay  had let her 
know about the block in advance but, from what Ive seen, Ms B wasnt using the 
card regularly. It hadnt been  used for spending  for quite some time. And theres 
nothing to suggest Ms B had suffered any loss as a result of the card being  blocked 
in the meantime. So, on that basis, I dont  think NewDay acted unreasonably.
Overall
In closing, its clear to me that Ms B has made great  effort  to manage her finances. 
But its not fair of me to say NewDay  made a mistake with her repayments.  Im 
satisfied NewDay applied  its terms and conditions correctly  in that regard. 
Additionally, I dont think NewDay acted unreasonably when  it lowered Ms Bs credit  
limit, or when it blocked her credit card.
Instead, my award to Ms B reflects how NewDay handled  the matter  and the impact  
to her. Although I appreciate Ms B might be disappointed by my findings,  based on 
what Ive seen, I think this is a fair and reasonable way to resolve this complaint.
Putting things right
I intend to uphold this complaint and require NewDay Ltd to pay Ms B £250  
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience  shes been caused.
NewDay responded to my provisional decision and said it didnt have anything  further  to add. 
Ms B also replied, and, in summary, said:
NewDay shouldve explained things  much sooner, which wouldve saved a lot of time 
and effort;
shes not confident that what NewDays reported is wholly  true; and
Ref: DRN09677916a larger  amount of compensation  should  be awarded. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having thought about Ms Bs comments,  I agree that NewDay  shouldve clarified things 
much sooner. I said in my provisional  findings  that NewDays explanations were generally  
unhelpful and  at times   simply incorrect. So I can certainly appreciate why Ms Bs 
confidence in NewDay is low, and why she thinks a higher award of compensation would act 
as a consequence of its actions.
Its important to keep  in mind, though, that our service isnt a regulator. Our role isnt to 
punish a business for its mistakes, and our awards  arent meant to act like a fine. Instead, 
theyre to compensate for the impact a business actions have had on a complainant.  
In this case, because of NewDays poor administration, Ms B undoubtedly spent more time 
than should have been necessary trying  to sort things out. But from what Ive seen, NewDay  
did apply her repayments in-line  with the terms that governed her account  at the time. So as 
frustrating as the matter  has clearly  been  for Ms B, Im satisfied she didnt lose any money  
as a result  of NewDays actions. And in the circumstances  of what happened,  I think  £250  is 
fair and reasonable compensation to reflect the distress and inconvenience caused by 
NewDays poor administration.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Bs complaint. I require NewDay  Ltd to pay her £250 
compensation* for the distress and inconvenience  shes been caused.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 January 2021.

ombudsman
*NewDay Ltd must pay the compensation within 28 days  of the date on which  we tell it Ms B 
accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest** on the £250 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
**If NewDay Ltd considers  that its required by HM Revenue & Customs  to withhold income 
tax from that interest, it should tell Ms B how much  its taken off. It should  also give Ms B a 
tax deduction  certificate  if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue  & 
Customs if appropriate.
