The complaint
Mr O is unhappy Barclays Bank UK PLC has closed his bank account and wont reinstate it 
and his overdraft facility.
What happened
The parties are familiar with the background to this complaint so I have only provided a 
summary below.
Mr O had a bank account and overdraft with Barclays
He experienced some financial difficulties in 2019
Between March and July 2019, Barclays wrote to him a number of times letting him 
know items had been returned unpaid and asking him to get in contact about his 
overdraft but he didnt respond to Barclays requests 
Eventually, in September 2019, Mr O got in contact and explained hed lost his job 
and experienced a bereavement
He said he had a new job and Barclays asked him to get back in contact once hed 
been paid to complete an income and expenditure form and agree a repayment plan
Mr O paid in some money to the account to reduce the debt but didnt get back in 
contact 
Barclays issued a termination notice in October 2019 and as there was no contact 
from Mr O, it transferred the debt to a debt collection firm and closed his account
Mr O complained and said it hadnt acted fairly and should reinstate the account and 
overdraft facility as hed paid off the debt but Barclays declined to do this.
Our investigator said she didnt think Barclays had acted unfairly and Mr O asked an 
ombudsman to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Barclays has provided copies of the letters it sent to Mr O during 2019 explaining the 
situation with his overdraft was getting increasingly serious
These letters are correctly addressed so, on balance, it seems likely they were 
received by Mr O
I understand he was going through a difficult time and Id expect Barclays to treat 
consumers with financial difficulties positively and sympathetically 
But Barclays could only be expected to do this once Mr O let it know about his 
circumstances 
He didnt do this until approximately six months after it first wrote to him asking him to 
make contact and had followed this up with regular letters, explaining the problem 
was getting more serious
But Mr O didnt respond until much later in September 2019 and was then asked to 
call back again  once the income from his new job started - to arrange a payment 
plan but didnt do this
In the absence of further contact from Mr O, I think it was reasonable that Barclays 
went ahead and issued a termination notice demanding full repayment of the 
overdraft
As the debt remained unpaid at the deadline, I think it was reasonable Barclays 
transferred the debt to a debt collection agency, cancelled the agreement and closed 
the current account
It was under an obligation to accurately report the status of the account and 
borrowing to credit reference agencies and so I dont think it acted unreasonably 
when it did that
Barclays has made a commercial decision not to reopen Mr Os account and thats 
not something which Im going to interfere with as its up to Barclays who it does 
business with and Ive seen nothing to suggest its treating Mr O any differently than 
it would another consumer in similar circumstances
In summary, I dont think Barclays has acted unreasonably in how it handled Mr Os 
account, so I wont be asking it to do anymore
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
