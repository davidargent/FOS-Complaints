The complaint
Mr H complains that N26 Bank GmbH unfairly lodged a marker with CIFAS about him.
What happened
Mr H has explained that he was operating a legitimate enterprise using a social media outlet
Ill refer to as M. This particular outlets messages usually disappeared once read. Mr H said
he was operating a business that would increase the visibility of other users posts and he
was also taking funds from another person who claimed to be involved in investing- Ill refer
to them as P.
Mr H said he would receive funds from P and use them to purchase crypto currency. Mr H
said that P wasnt involved in this aspect of investing and he believed the funds he was
receiving were the result of activity generated by P. Mr H has said he purchased crypto
currency from special automated teller machines and an online marketplace. To support this
enterprise, Mr H opened an account with N26 and within about a week, N26 started to
receive notifications from various other banks that funds received by Mr H were the result of
fraud.
The reports from these banks indicated the funds were the result of various types of financial
frauds. These included an investment scam, also clothes/shoes and electronic orders that
werent fulfilled. These frauds had originated from posts on M and other social media
platforms.
N 26 ring fenced various funds while they waited for the sending banks to request the return
of these funds. They advised Mr H that checks were being conducted on his account. N26
received various requests from these banks for the return of fraudulent funds and Mr Hs
remaining account balance was used to pay back some of these requests. A few months
later, N26 closed Mr Hs account and lodged a CIFAS marker against him.
CIFAS is a national fraud prevention organisation that holds information on suspected
fraudsters and their victims. Mr H became aware of the marker and complained to N26 about 
it, arguing that he was also a victim of the activities of P. Mr H didnt realise the funds he was 
receiving were the result of fraudulent activity and all his activities had been in good faith. 
N26 didnt change their decision to lodge the marker and refused to remove it.
Mr H complained to the Financial Ombudsman about the treatment hed received from N26
and their refusal to remove the marker which was causing Mr H difficulties opening other
financial accounts.
Mr H has argued that because N26 sent back most of the funds that resulted from fraudulent
activity  he hasnt profited from them and together with his lack of knowledge about the
source of the funds, this is evidence he wasnt involved in the frauds.
Mr Hs complaint was looked into by one of our investigators who asked both parties for
information and evidence. Mr H gave a detailed account of what happened and supplied
various documents to support his claim. N26 failed to respond for some time and our
investigator issued her report based on the information which Mr H had provided. Mr Hs
complaint was upheld and sometime after this, N26 sent their file.
The original investigator was no longer available to manage the case, so it was moved to the
second stage of our process which is a referral to an Ombudsman. I was passed the
complaint and have had a chance to read the evidence from both Mr H and N 26. Follow up
requests for information have been requested and Im grateful to both parties for their
contributions.
I can issue a provisional decision where its felt the outcome is likely to change or to give
both parties an understanding of my thinking. Because the original view was issued with only
part of the information available, Id intended to issue a provisional decision to allow both
parties to consider my thoughts and have the chance to respond, and that would be even if I
was going to uphold Mr Hs complaint. Here, Im currently thinking about not upholding it.
I issued a provisional decision where I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CIFAs have particular rules that must be satisfied before a marker against a person can be
lodged. The standards required to lodge a marker are high and thats because the markers
last for (usually) six years and can have a significant negative impact on someone.
In particular, there are two pillars that are relevant to this complaint that N26 have to meet:
That there are reasonable grounds to believe that a Fraud or Financial Crime has
been committed or attempted.
That the evidence must be clear, relevant and rigorous such that the member could
confidently report the conduct of the subject to the police.
N26 received numerous reports of fraudulent funds being received by Mr H over a short
period of time. These reports were from multiple different banks. Im satisfied the receipt of
these reports meet the standards of the first pillar.
The crux of this complaint is whether N26 have met the second pillar. N26 believe Mr H
was involved in the receipt of fraudulent funds and then withdrew these funds via an ATM or
transferred them to another account held by Mr H with another bank. Mr H on the other hand
says these payments were the result of his business venture promoting accounts on Ms
platform and purchasing crypto currency through payments received from P.
N26s evidence is mainly centred on the use of the account, the receipt of the funds and their
dispersal. They thought Mr Hs use of the account was unusual and that it followed a pattern
of use often associated with fraudulent activities. I can see why N26 considered Mr Hs use
of the account as unusual because within days of it being opened, it was receiving multiple
small payments into it, with several being reported as fraudulent. Ive examined the reports
from the other banks and there are references to various scams. Some of the reports have
details of the scam including the social media account they were linked to or shortened
names that could be associated with Mr H (K**/Mr K** H**/K**123). N26 didnt believe Mr Hs
explanation about his activities and thought they met the standards required by CIFAS when
they lodged a marker against him.
* has been used to mask potential identification.Mr H has explained in some detail how his enterprise operated, and he admits he doesnt
have some of the evidence needed to support his case because the platform (M) erases old
messages. He has provided various screenshots to support his case. He said that he was
unaware the funds he was receiving were fraudulent and points to a partial conversation
(undated) with P. In it he asks P why theres a different name on one of the incoming
payments. Hes told that the person owed money to P and hed asked them to send it
straight to Mr H.
When I examined Mr Hs statements, its apparent that he was receiving numerous relatively
small payments into his account from many different account holders. Mr Hs evidence is
that he was promoting pages on M, which accounted for some of the incoming payments
and others were linked to payments sent by P. Many of the payments werent reported as
fraudulent, so I think its reasonable to conclude that at least some of Mr Hs business was
legitimate.
The only reference I can find about crypto currency is a screenshot of Mr Hs prices for
promotional activities. This appears to me to refer to how he can be paid, rather than any
crypto currency service he was offering.
I do have some difficulty with Mr Hs explanation about the arrangements with P. Mr H has
said P was involved in investing  but not crypto currency. Ps arrangement with Mr H was
that funds would be provided to him which Mr H would in turn use to purchase crypto funds
and send back to P. In Mr Hs evidence, P provides a wallet for receiving such crypto
currency.
Mr H said he used specialist ATMs and an online marketplace to purchase crypto currency.
His evidence is limited about this. Some of the screenshots hes sent are undated and others
relate to activity prior to the opening of the N26 account. Mr H has indicated that hes since
being locked out of his crypto account and is unable to provide details of his dealings about
it.
I asked Mr H why P would go to the trouble of sending funds to him to buy crypto currency
just to send back to P  which would entail additional costs to P because Mr H would
naturally want to profit from this activity. Mr H explained that it was because P wasnt
involved in that area of financial activity and had a lack of knowledge about it.
The alternative explanation was that P was using Mr H to change the fraudulent funds from
cash into crypto currency to further frustrate efforts to retrieve it. So, Ive thought about Mr
Hs explanations and it could be that he was effectively duped by P into receiving fraudulent
funds and exchanging them for crypto currency which was then sent to P. Once in crypto
form, stolen funds are hard to trace.
But, Im brought back to the reports from various banks about stolen funds being sent to Mr
Hs account. The reports follow a similar pattern of the senders being duped into investing or
buying goods and then being blocked. Mr H is never mentioned by name  but (as set out
above) there are numerous references that appear to be versions of Mr Hs name in the
banking payment references.
It seems to me that this points to Mr H having more of an involvement than just receiving
payments from Ps customers. Why would someone use parts of his name as a reference if
they were Ps customers? Im also doubtful that P - as an investment enterprise would also
appear be a trader in goods, as theres no mention of that relationship in any of the evidence
Ive seen.
What is apparent from the evidence is that Mr H was in receipt of fraudulent funds andremoved them from his N26 bank account, although some of them were later returned to the
senders by N26. But the sending of those funds back to their source by N26 isnt evidence
that Mr H wasnt involved in the active movement of the stolen funds.
I think N26 had sufficient evidence to lodge a marker with CIFAS. Thats because I think it
was reasonable to believe that the reports from the other banks had sufficient information to
indicate Mr H was more than an innocent dupe.
So, my current thoughts are that I wont be upholding this complaint.
I invited Mr H and N26 to give me any more evidence and information they wanted me to
consider before issuing my final decision. N 26 didnt add anything further and Mr H
responded, saying:
He didnt think the withdrawals of cash was evidence of his involvement in fraud.
That the fraudulent payments only formed a small part of otherwise legitimate
payments.
There is evidence of selling crypto currency with timings.
He believed that evidence of trading prior to the opening of the N26 account is
supportive of his case that he was operating legitimately.
He didnt believe the lack of evidence of trading was unusual due to the way the site
he used was operating and he had no reason to request further information from the
senders.
He now thinks the clients he was dealing with may have been responsible for the
fraudulent funds, but he was unaware of them at the time.
He explains that his name was used on the bank transfers because hed given it to
his client for them to pass on to the senders of the funds.
He commented that earlier Ombudsmans decisions had referred to independent
investigations before CIFAS markers were lodged.
He believes that because he didnt immediately remove the fraudulent funds from his
account  this supported his case that he wasnt involved in the original scams.
He believed the complaint had been rushed and he was assumed to be guilty.
He believed that the facts have been interpreted against him when hes been
consistent throughout the complaint and supplied evidence.
Having received further information, I issued a second provisional decision reversing my 
previous one  where I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful for the patience of both parties whilst additional evidence has been sought and
considered. This complaint is finely balanced, and Ive thought carefully about the evidence
provided by both parties. Mr H has now been able to provide evidence that supports hisassertion that he was purchasing crypto funds and advertised this as a service. Hes also
been able to clarify the dates when some of this activity happened and evidence that one of
the fraudulent payments he received was later returned to P as a bitcoin purchase.
This transaction, along with screenshots, shows that Mr H questioned one of the fraudulent
payments he received into his account. Its specific about the amount (£75) that Mr H was
selling bitcoin for which included his profit. The fraud report linked to this payment refers to a
scam purchase for clothes, much like some of the other fraud reports. Whilst theres an
element of interpretation involved here, its plausible that whoever was behind the scam was
also responsible for more than one of them because of the similarities in the way they
operated.
One of the incoming reports had a social media name that appeared to be linked to Mr H. He
was able to provide evidence this account was likely operated by someone unconnected to
him.
Further details from another of Mr Hs accounts has identified patterns of payments similar to
those identified on his N26 account. These being numerous small incoming payments that
were withdrawn either as cash or sent to other accounts. There are no reports of fraudulent
activity associated with this account and theres evidence that supports Mr Hs version of
events that he was paying other media influencers to promote social media accounts.
Mr H believes that N26 should have contacted him prior to lodging the marker based on
CIFAS guidance. This guidance wasnt released by CIFAS when N26 lodged the marker,
although it came out soon after. What I would say is that Mr H was aware of the marker
shortly after it was lodged and contacted N26 numerous times about it and presented his
version of events. So, whilst N26 could have contacted Mr H prior to the lodgement of the
marker, N26 were aware of the case Mr H was trying to make. As Ive mentioned before,
they didnt believe his version of events and were satisfied theyd met the standards for
lodging the marker.
Mr H was of the opinion that hed been presumed guilty. Thats not the case here. The
outcome of his complaint is based on an independent assessment of all the evidence and
N26 lodged their marker based on their own investigation. Similarly, my first provisional
decision was based on an assessment of the evidence. As Ive said this complaint is finely
balanced as on the one hand theres a large number of fraud reports that are submitted
about Mr H related to an account that hed only recently opened. The removal of funds
supports a view that he may well have known the source of the funds was suspicious, so I
can see why N26 lodged the marker in the first place.
On the other hand, Mr H has presented a version of events that could be seen as him being
taken advantage of by a scammer. He himself admits that he doesnt operate his businesses
in that way anymore and is far more discerning when it comes to receiving money from
others. I think its apparent that unidentified third parties were responsible for what looks like
a wide-ranging set of scams that targeted people with various frauds for small amounts of
money.
Ive also taken into account Mr Hs age and experience when operating his business
interests. It seems as though others, who were far savvier, have taken advantage of his
relative inexperience to use his crypto business to move stolen funds.
There are some aspects to the complaint that havent been answered, such as evidence of
other crypto purchases for P because the records are no longer available, but overall, I think
theres sufficient doubt to support the case that the marker should be retained.Mr H believes he should receive the original award set out in the investigators review of his
complaint, which was £300. But, when examining the investigation that N26 carried out and
the overall evidence available at the time, I dont think it was unreasonable that N26 lodged
the marker.
But, the relevance here is that the overall evidence now shows Mr H was more victim than
perpetrator, so the fair and reasonable thing to do is to remove the marker, understanding
that its already been operating for the past three years, but I think it would be unfair for N26
to pay Mr H any compensation based on the evidence available to them at the time.
I invited Mr H and N26 to give me any more evidence and information they wanted me to
consider before issuing my final decision. N26 commented that they were satisfied theyd 
met the standards required of CIFAS when the original marker was lodged. But, they 
understood a resolution to the complaint was required and accepted my second provisional 
decision. Mr H didnt have anything further to add about his complaint, but also accepted the 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and as both parties accepted my latest provisional decision, I see no 
reason to reach a different conclusion. So, this final decision confirms the findings set out in 
my second provisional decision.
Putting things right
Remove the CIFAS marker lodged against Mr H.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against N26 Bank GmbH and theyre 
instructed to remove the CIFAS marker against Mr H.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 November 2022.
