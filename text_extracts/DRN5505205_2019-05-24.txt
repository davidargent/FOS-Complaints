K821x#15complaint
Mr S says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 18 high-cost short term loans,  several  of the loans were  topped up 
with additional  borrowing. There  were a total of 17 topups  and loan 4 was a flex credit 
account. QuickQuid  provided the loans to Mr S between  December  2013  and October  2017  
and gave him 35 advances in total.
Ive listed some details about  the loans as an appendix to this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr S complaint in part and thought the loans from 13 August 2014 
during the course of the flex credit account  and all subsequent loans shouldnt have been 
given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that loans 1 to 3 and the early part of the flex credit  
account should be upheld. Mr S hasnt disagreed  with the adjudication about these loans.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As Mr S hasnt  disagreed with the adjudication on loans 1 to 3 and the early part of the flex 
credit, I dont think there isnt an ongoing  dispute  about those loans. So I havent gone  into 
further details  about that lending here. 
In response to our adjudication, QuickQuid disagreed that it had done anything wrong during 
the course of the flex credit  account  and subsequent loans.  It also said:
We started implementing changes to the affordability assessment in June 2014 and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 before Mr S borrowed 
his fifth loan, QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the 
FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We 
confirm that this assessment was conducted  properly  and individually  for each of these loans 
 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  
This service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on this point any further  here, though Ive 
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. And so my decision focusses 
on the specifics of Mr S complaint and what both parties have said about  this.
Ref: DRN55052052QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG), 
which was in effect in the early stage of the lending relationship  defined  sustainable in much 
the same  way as CONC.
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr S complaint.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN55052053Given the particular  circumstances of Mr S case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
13 August 2014  during the course  of the flex credit. I say this because  from the start of the 
flex credit account, Mr S was using the facility  like a payday loan, he was drawing down  
funds and repaying them within a month. By 13 August 2014, Mr S had been borrowing from 
QuickQuid for around 12 months without any significant breaks. There were  breaks  of 
around two months  between loans 2 and 3 and loans 3 and 4, but I dont think in that time 
QuickQuid could reasonably have believed  that Mr S finances  had improved, particularly as 
he was increasing  his borrowing. 
From 13 August 2014 onwards,  Mr S continued  to borrow from QuickQuid for nearly three 
years. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to 
borrow further to cover  the gap repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and 
that Mr S indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  Loan  18 was taken  
out nearly 60 months after Mr S first. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, 
service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended  period. QuickQuid  itself has said that its loans  
arent suitable for long term use. And I think there was sufficient evidence here to alert 
QuickQuid to the fact that Mr S wasnt using these  loans for their intended  purpose.  The fact 
that Mr S repeatedly  repaid  several of the loans before they were due and very quickly  
borrowed again shouldve  concerned  QuickQuid  that a pattern which was unsustainable  had 
been formed.
QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from 13 August 2014 onwards and Mr S has lost 
out because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr S indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr S 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  his borrowing from 13 August 2014  through  to loan 18 
and QuickQuid should put things  right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on the flex credit  account from 
13 August 2014 through to loan 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from 13 August 2014  onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about the drawdowns from 
13 August 2014 from the flex credit account  through to loan 18 should be removed  
from Mr S credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr S a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN55052054my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr S complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
