The complaint
Mr A complains National Westminster Bank Plc has acted unfairly because it no longer 
allows him to benefit from Mastercard protection  i.e. the ability to raise a chargeback  
when he makes purchases. He also complains National Westminster Bank Plc has accused 
him of making fraudulent transactions, isnt making reasonable adjustments for him and has 
discriminated against him.
What happened
Mr A has a credit card issued by NatWest. He says hes a vulnerable adult, is neurodiverse 
and has a number of physical disabilities and mental health issues. Hes had the help of a 
representative during this complaint.
NatWest says Mr A made more than five chargeback claims in February 2022. NatWest 
says because of this it restricted Mr As account when he made another chargeback claim in 
March 2022. NatWest says the number of chargeback claims Mr A was making 
unreasonable use of the chargeback process, was making excessive claims and that 
these excessive claims indicated potential fraud.
NatWest says Mr A attempted to make another chargeback claim in December 2022. 
NatWest emailed Mr A to say that it couldnt refund this claim hed as it could see hed made 
multiple claims of this kind. NatWest also said that it had investigated his claim and had 
identified it as potentially fraudulent leaving it with no option other than to not process the 
claim and to monitor future conduct of his account. NatWest asked Mr A to consider the 
authenticity of any future claims before submitting them, remembering that false claims are 
considered as fraud and would be treated as such.
Mr A called NatWest to complain saying that what it was doing was wrong, that it couldnt tell 
a customer they could no longer make chargeback claims because theyd raised lots of 
claims and that it had no right to accuse him of behaving fraudulently. He said that all of the 
claims hed raised had been genuine  and successful. The agent to whom Mr A spoke said 
that there was nothing that could be done  hed made excessive claims, had made 
unreasonable use of the chargeback process and a decision had been taken that NatWest 
wouldnt consider any further claims from him. The agent added that this decision had been 
reviewed already so asking for a review wouldnt make a difference.
Mr A was unhappy with NatWest saying it wouldnt allow him to make any more chargeback 
claims and its accusations that hed behaved fraudulently as well as the language it had 
used to scare him into not making any more claims. He complained to us pointing out that 
the merchant had subsequently agreed to a refund showing the claim hed made in 
December 2022 was genuine. Following our involvement NatWest told us that it didnt think it 
had acted unfairly as it had followed processes it has in place for when customers make 
excessive chargeback claims. In addition, NatWest told us that it would consider 
chargeback claims that Mr A makes, but that it would only do so if the claim is backed up by 
documentation.
One of our investigators looked into Mr As complaint and said that they didnt think it was 
unfair of NatWest to say that it would only consider chargeback claims that Mr A makes if 
theyre backed up by documentation as he had, according to NatWests processes for 
handling chargeback claims, made an excessive number of claims. Our investigator said 
that although NatWest was aware that Mr A was vulnerable before hed made the claim that 
triggered its excessive claims process, they didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly and 
that in relation to chargeback claims reasonable adjustments can be difficult to make. And 
they didnt think NatWest had acted unreasonably in the way they communicated with Mr A. 
NatWest had, however, agreed to send Mr A an apology in writing for the way its letters had 
made him feel. Our investigator thought that was fair and reasonable.
Mr A disagreed and asked for a decision from an ombudsman. So, his complaint was 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Last month I issued a provisional decision in which I said the following:
Mr A complained to our service saying that NatWest had told him that it wouldnt 
consider any more chargeback claims he submitted  regardless of whether or not 
theyre genuine  because hed made an excessive number of claims. Im satisfied 
that this is what an agent told Mr A when he spoke to them on the phone about why a 
claim that hed made in December 2022 had been rejected. NatWest has since said 
that Mr A can submit further chargeback claims but that itll only do so if the claim is 
backed up by documentation.
Our investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly given that it had followed its 
processes for when a customer makes excessive chargeback claims. Ive seen 
details of those processes, and I dont entirely agree. Ill explain why.
Its clear from NatWests processes that if one of its customers makes what it 
considers to be an excessive number of chargeback claims over a certain period of 
time, then NatWest will place restrictions on the customers account. Theres guidance 
on what constitutes a claim so that what it essentially one dispute isnt characterised 
as multiple claims. NatWests process appears to be aimed at preventing abuses of 
the chargeback system rather than genuine claims  something I agree isnt 
unreasonable.
I dont think that the process or the guidance Ive seen is unfair or unreasonable as far 
as it goes, but the process and guidance make no obvious distinction between 
successful and unsuccessful claims even though the process appears to be aimed at 
preventing abuses of the chargeback system rather than genuine claims. In 
addition, the process and the guidance arent clear as to exactly what should happen 
when a customer has been deemed to have made an excessive number of claims, 
and this may well explain what appear to be inconsistencies in what NatWest told Mr A 
would happen in the event he made further chargeback claims and what its since told 
us. More importantly, Ive seen nothing to suggest the process or guidance takes into 
account the impact a disability, condition or vulnerability might have on the number of 
chargeback claims a customer might raise and / or the merits of such claims. In Mr As 
case, Im minded to say that this has resulted in NatWest treating a customer who it 
knew to be vulnerable in an unfair way. In short, I dont think NatWest took Mr As 
disabilities, conditions and vulnerabilities into account.Im satisfied that NatWest caused Mr A considerable distress when it told him that it 
wouldnt consider any more chargeback claims from him. Im also satisfied that 
NatWest caused Mr A considerable distress when it said that it believed he was acting 
fraudulently simply because of the number of claims hed made. And I dont think its 
unfair or unreasonable of Mr A to expect NatWest to make reasonable adjustments in 
all its dealings with him. I dont think its unfair of NatWest to let Mr A know that it 
would be better if he evidences any claims he makes in the future when he makes 
them  NatWest does, after all, have to decide whether a chargeback claim has a 
reasonable prospect of success before raising it. But unless and until NatWest  
having taken Mr As vulnerabilities and conditions and disabilities into account  has 
evidence that Mr A is abusing the chargeback process, I dont think its fair and 
reasonable of NatWest to say it wont consider any further chargeback claims.
Given what Ive just said, Im minded to require NatWest to remove the restriction that 
it has placed on Mr As account in relation to his ability to raise chargebacks. That 
doesnt mean NatWest cant ask Mr A for evidence to back up any future chargeback 
claims he makes, particularly if that evidence is going to be needed to decide whether 
or not the claim has a reasonable prospect of success. And Im minded to require 
NatWest to pay Mr A Â£300 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has 
caused. NatWest ought to bear its obligations under the Equality Act 2010, and 
towards vulnerable consumers generally, in mind going forwards too.
Mr As representative replied to my provisional decision to say that Mr A didnt have anything 
further to add  that Id picked up on the main crux of the matter in that Mr A has numerous 
and complex physical and mental health issues, which NatWest hadnt at any point 
appeared to acknowledge or make reasonable adjustments for. NatWest didnt respond.
Having reconsidered everything, I remain of the view that the process or the guidance Ive 
seen is unfair or unreasonable as far as it goes, but the process and guidance make no 
obvious distinction between successful and unsuccessful claims even though the process 
appears to be aimed at preventing abuses of the chargeback system rather than genuine 
claims. In addition, I remain of the view that the process and the guidance arent clear as to 
exactly what should happen when a customer has been deemed to have made an 
excessive number of claims, and this may well explain what appear to be inconsistencies in 
what NatWest told Mr A would happen in the event he made further chargeback claims and 
what its since told us. More importantly, I remain of the view that Ive seen nothing to 
suggest the process or guidance takes into account the impact a disability, condition or 
vulnerability might have on the number of chargeback claims a customer might raise and / or 
the merits of such claims. In this case, therefore, I remain of the view that this has resulted in 
NatWest treating a customer - who it knew to be vulnerable in an unfair way. Or to put it 
another way, I dont think NatWest took Mr As disabilities, conditions and vulnerabilities into 
account.
I remain of the view that NatWest caused Mr A considerable distress when it told him that it 
wouldnt consider any more chargeback claims from him and when it said that it believed he 
was acting fraudulently simply because of the number of claims hed made. And I dont think 
its unfair or unreasonable of Mr A to expect NatWest to make reasonable adjustments in 
all its dealings with him. I also remain of the view that it isnt unfair of NatWest to let Mr A 
know that it would be better if he evidences any claims he makes in the future when he 
makes them  NatWest does, after all, have to decide whether a chargeback claim has a 
reasonable prospect of success before raising it. But unless and until NatWest  having 
taken Mr As vulnerabilities and conditions and disabilities into account  has evidence that 
Mr A is abusing the chargeback process, I remain of the view that it isnt fair and 
reasonable of NatWest to say it wont consider any further chargeback claims.Putting things right
Given what Ive just said, I remain of the view that its fair to require NatWest to remove the 
restriction that it has placed on Mr As account in relation to his ability to raise chargebacks. 
That doesnt mean NatWest cant ask Mr A for evidence to back up any future chargeback 
claims he makes, particularly if that evidence is going to be needed to decide whether or not 
the claim has a reasonable prospect of success. And I also remain of the view that its fair to 
require NatWest to pay Mr A Â£300 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has 
caused. So thats what Im going to require NatWest to do. In my provisional decision I said 
that NatWest ought to bear its obligations under the Equality Act 2010, and towards 
vulnerable consumers generally, in mind going forwards in its dealings with Mr A. I know 
thats important to Mr A too, so I hope NatWest will do so.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding this complaint and requiring National Westminster 
Bank Plc to remove the restriction that it has placed on Mr As account in relation to his 
ability to raise chargebacks. In addition, Im requiring National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr A Â£300 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2023.
