K821x#15complaint
Mrs S has complained about short-term loans granted to her by CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mrs S says she couldnt afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether she could afford them when she took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed nineteen short-term loans  for Mrs S between  September 2011 and 
December 2016.  Each  loan was repayable over between one and three months. Mrs S took 
out top-ups  and re-finances on several of the loans,  labelled a and b. This is where she 
either took out further borrowing under the same  agreement, before paying back  the initial 
amount borrowed;  or borrowed further  funds,  extending the term of the original agreement,  
agreeing a new repayment schedule.   There was also a gap of around 11 months between 
loan 3 being repaid  and loan 4 being taken out. Ive set out a summary  of the lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mrs Ss complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loans  1 to 8 werent  
proportionate. But he thought had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks on loans 1  7, 
it was still likely to have  concluded these loans were  affordable  for her. And that while he 
thought the checks completed on loan 8 werent  proportionate, due to limited evidence  
provided by Mrs S, he was unable  to determine  what proportionate checks wouldve shown,  
and was therefore unable to conclude  that QuickQuid was wrong  in approving  loan 8 either.
Ref: DRN12788042But he thought  that, looking at the pattern of lending from loan 8 onwards, meant  that in 
itself, it was irresponsible of QuickQuid to have  continued to provide further loans from this 
point onwards, so it shouldnt  have agreed to loans 9  19.
Mrs S raised no new arguments in response  to these findings. QuickQuid however, 
disagreed with the findings. So as no agreements been reached at this stage, the case has 
come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.  As loans 1  8 no longer appear in 
dispute, my decision will focus  on the remaining loans, loans 9  19, including  any 
re-finances or top-ups on these loans. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, found  that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks for some of Mrs Ss earlier applications. And he felt based  on his 
review, that up until the point loan 9 was taken,  Mrs Ss pattern of lending  to date shouldve  
alerted QuickQuid that she was no longer using the loans for the purpose intended. And that 
therefore, from this point on, any further  lending wouldve been unsustainable,  and shouldve  
therefore stopped. These  findings were  set out in some detail in a view letter  to the lender.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs S 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Ss income  and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mrs Ss complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mrs S would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mrs S would have been  able to do so?
Ref: DRN127880432.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mrs Ss indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mrs S would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks 
have shown that Mrs S would have been  able to do so?
As loans  1 - 8 are no longer in dispute, I havent  reconsidered the proportionality of the 
checks QuickQuid carried out on these loans as part of my assessment. And I havent 
recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 9 - 19 either, because I dont 
think that it is necessary  to do so. Ill explain why.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mrs Ss indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mrs S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 9. I say this because:
the amounts  Mrs S was borrowing was increasing, and QuickQuid  ought  to have 
realised it was likely her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mrs S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed lender. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period
I think that Mrs S lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mrs Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans
QuickQuids also argued,  that the adjudicators implied in his opinion,  that QuickQuid  
breached CONC, purely because of the number  of loans issued. However, having reviewed 
the opinion, it seems clear  to me that the number  of loans is one of many  considerations 
made by the adjudicator, in concluding  that QuickQuid shouldve  realised  at the point  of 
loan 9, that the lending  was no longer sustainable for Mrs S. And I agree with these findings, 
and for the same  reasons.  So QuickQuids  response to the adjudicators opinion on this 
point, does not alter my findings. 
Ref: DRN12788044So Im upholding  Mrs Ss complaint about  loans 9 to 19 (including any top-ups or re-finances 
of these loans) because  the overall pattern of lending  increased her indebtedness  in a way 
that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and she lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mrs S in some  
other way.  
In summary,  I think QuickQuid should not have agreed to loans 9 - 19, including  any top-ups 
or re-finances of these  loans. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loans 9 onwards. So it needs to refund all of 
the interest and charges Mrs S paid towards these  loans.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mrs S paid on loans 9 to 19, including  all re-finances 
and top-ups on these  loans;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
-remove any negative information  about loans 9 to 19 from Mrs Ss credit file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 9 to 19 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  9 to 19 should be removed from Mrs Ss 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mrs S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mrs Ss complaint  in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.
