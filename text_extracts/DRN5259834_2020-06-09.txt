K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that he hasnt received a refund of all his overpayments to Clydesdale 
Financial Services Limited  trading as Barclays Partner Finance (BPF)
background
Mr C had three accounts with BPF for retail purchases. His complaint is mainly about  
agreement ending 003. He says he made overpayments and he hasnt got his money back.
BPF explains that Mr C was refunded all of his overpayments and there  is no further money  
due to him.
Our investigator looked at Mr Cs complaint  and concluded that BPF had refunded all of the 
overpayments to Mr C and so she couldnt  ask it to do any more.
 
Mr C didnt agree and replied to say in summary  that the investigator had misunderstood his 
complaints. He provided all of his account statements and letters  and explained that he had 
not had his money back.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to reassure  Mr C that I have considered his complaint in detail and looked very 
carefully through all of the information  that he and BPF have provided.
In relation to the main account ending  003 I can see that Mr C borrowed £1999  in 
December 2014.  Mr C fell into arrears immediately. In April 2016  Mr C began  making  
payments. Looking at the statement of account  Mr C often made  a number of payments on 
the same  day. By July 2016 Mr C had cleared the balance and the account was in credit by 
£401.19.
On 5 July 2016 BPF repaid Mr C £251.19 by way of a bank transfer. I have seen Mr Bs 
bank statement for this period and this confirms  that the payment was credited to his 
account. 
On 11 July 2016 Mr C made a further payment to the account of £50 and so the total amount 
he had overpaid  was now £200. BPF tried to pay Mr C this money back via a bank transfer 
on 13 July 2016  but this was unsuccessful. The money could not be credited to Mr C so it 
essentially bounced back to BPF who re-credited it to his account with it. The amount was 
re-credited on 28 July according  to the account statement. It appears that the money  was 
credited again  in error on 29 July but that was corrected the same day and debited from the 
account.
BPF tried to send the overpaid  money  to Mr C again  on 11 August 2016 but it was returned 
on 26 August. A further attempt was made on 13 September 2016  but it was returned again 
on 23 September.
Ref: DRN52598342Looking at the account statement I can understand why Mr C is confused. He says that he is 
owed £1000 as the account  statement does show £1000  credited to the account but these 
are the 4 returned  unsuccessful payments and the duplicated payment. Mr C did not make 
these payments to BPF and he hasnt provided me with any evidence to show  that he did.  
On 7 October 2016 a cheque for £200 was issued  to Mr C which I can see from his account 
statement was presented for payment  and cleared  on 18 October 2016.
Mr C overpaid  by £451.19 and this was returned to him by way of a transfer for £251.19 on 
the 5 July 2016 and a cheque for £200 on 7 October  2016.  So on that basis  I cant  see that 
BPF owe him anything  else.
A further  refund of £258.59 was provided  for another issue  with the account which does not 
relate to any overpayments.
I have looked  at the other accounts and I cant see that there is anything that suggests Mr C 
is owed a refund on those  either.
I can fully appreciate why Mr C is confused as the account statement  appears to show that 
there have  been  credits  that he has not received  but these credits  are the returned refund 
attempts and not an overpayment by Mr C.
So I cant see that BPF has done anything wrong  or that Mr C is owed anything else.
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 July 2020.
