The complaint
Ms A complains that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) provided her with a number of unaffordable 
logbook loans (loans).
Ms A is represented in her complaint by a third party. However, I will simply refer to Ms A 
throughout this decision rather than Ms A and her representative.
What happened
Ms A applied for, and was granted by L2G, the following loans all repayable (everything else 
being equal) over 36 months:

In September 2021 Ms A complained to L2G that it shouldnt have granted her loans 2 to 7 
on the grounds they were unaffordable.
In October 2021 L2G issued Ms A with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this 
FRL L2G said it didnt believe it had done anything wrong in granting any of the loans.
Ms As complaint was considered by one of our investigators who found that L2G shouldnt 
have granted loans 6 and 7, but it had done nothing wrong in granting loans 2 to 5. She also 
outlined what L2G should have to do to fairly and reasonably compensate Ms A for granting 
her loans 6 and 7.
Ms A didnt respond to the investigators view and L2G responded to say it disagreed with it. 
And because of the latter, Ms As complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on 
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Ms As complaint. 
L2G had to assess the lending to check if Ms A could afford to pay back the amounts shed 
borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate to 
the circumstances. L2Gs checks could have considered a number of different things, such 
as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Ms As income and 
expenditure. 
L2G was required to establish whether Ms A could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms A was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ms A didnt respond to the investigators view so its not clear whether she accepts what she 
said, that being L2G shouldnt have granted loans 6 and 7, but it did nothing wrong in 
granting her loans 2 to 5. But having considered everything the parties have said and 
submitted I can confirm that Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator and for the 
same reasons.
loan 1
Ms A hasnt complained about this loan, so I make no comment or finding on it in this 
decision. 
loans 2 to 3
Given the sums applied for, granted and when, and given the checks L2G have been able to 
demonstrate it undertook in respect of these two loans Im satisfied that it did enough to 
satisfy itself that Ms A would be able to repay these two loans in a sustainable way and it did 
nothing wrong in granting them.
loans 4 and 5
Given the sums applied for, granted and when, and given the checks L2G have been able to 
demonstrate it undertook in respect of these two loans Im satisfied that it didnt do enough 
to satisfy itself that Ms A would be able to repay these two loans in a sustainable way. In 
other words, it should have carried out additional checks.
But, to assess what it is that L2G may have found in relation to Ms As financial position if it 
had carried out further checks, then Id need to see additional information from Ms A. But no 
financial details or documents to support her complaint have been sent to us. So, using the 
evidence that has been provided by the parties, I can confirm Im satisfied I cant reasonably 
conclude that L2G did anything wrong in granting these two loans.
loan 6
In respect of this loan, it appears that L2G completed an income and expenditure form, 
asked for, received and reviewed a recent bank statement and undertook a credit check. 
Having considered the information L2G obtained (and referred to above) I must say Ive 
some reservations about the conclusion it reached that Ms A could sustainably repay this 
loan. But even if I wasnt of this view, like the investigator, Im satisfied that given:this loan was the sixth Ms A had applied for in 27 months
there were no gaps in Ms As borrowing between May 2015 (when loan 1 was 
granted) and June 2017 (when loan 6 was applied for)
Ms A had never paid more than £70 (in capital) off her previous loans by way of 
monthly payments
Ms A had never paid more than 15% (in capital) off her previous loans by way of 
monthly payments
immediately before being granted loan 6 Ms A had already made repayments 
totalling over £2,500 for a net total loan advance of less than £1,500
by taking loan 6 Ms A, everything else being equal, would have been indebted to 
L2G for a further 36 months in addition to the 27 she had already been indebted to it
the monthly repayment on loan 6 was almost four times the monthly repayment on 
loan 1
had loan 6 run its full term, and had Ms A made each and every monthly repayment 
required of her, she would have ended up repaying over £8,500 for a net total loan 
advance of less than £1,700
leads me to conclude that L2G acted irresponsibly in granting this loan because it was 
increasing Ms As indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or was otherwise harmful to 
her.
loan 7
For the same and/or similar reasons as to why I found loan 6 shouldnt have been granted to 
Ms A, I find L2G shouldnt have granted loan 7 to her either.
Putting things right
Because Ive found that L2G shouldnt have advanced loans 6 and 7 (but it did nothing 
wrong in granting loans 2 to 5) then to fairly and reasonably compensate Ms A I find that it 
must:
remove all interest, fees and charges applied to loans 6 and 7
treat all payments made by Ms A (against loans 6 and 7) as payments towards the 
capital amounts of them
refund to Ms A all payments she made (against loans 6 and 7) in excess of the 
capital amounts together with 8% simple yearly interest from the date each payment 
was made to the date of settlement*
remove any negative information it has recorded with one or more credit reference 
agencies in respect of loans 6 and 7
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans 2 Go Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
Loans 2 Go Limited must give Ms A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that Loans 2 Go Limited must compensate Ms A as outlined by me 
above under the heading Putting things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or reject my decision before 1 May 2023.
