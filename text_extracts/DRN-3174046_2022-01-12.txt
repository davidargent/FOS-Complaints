The complaint
Mrs W complains that TransUnion International UK Limited merged her credit file with a third 
party. 
  
What happened
At the beginning of March 2021 Mrs W contacted TransUnion by email to complain that 
someone elses credit commitments were showing on her credit file. TransUnion 
acknowledged Mrs Ws email and said it would be passed to the disputes team to deal with. 
Mrs W has told us that in the weeks and months that followed she tried to raise her concerns 
with TransUnion by various means, including online and over the phone. 
Mrs W ask this service to get involved as she didnt receive any responses from TransUnion. 
TransUnion says it received Mrs Ws complaint in June 2021, when we brought the matter to 
its attention, and took steps to investigate her concerns. TransUnion issued a final response 
on 2 August 2021 that said someone elses credit was showing on her credit report and that 
the third party had the same name and date of birth as Mrs W. TransUnion corrected the link 
and offered Mrs W £50 for its error. 
An investigator looked at Mrs Ws complaint and upheld it. They asked TransUnion to 
increase the compensation offered to £650 and pointed out that it took five months from the 
point Mrs W first contacted it for the matter to be resolved. The investigator also said Mrs W 
had told us about fraud concerns as private information was shared with a third party. Mrs W 
forwarded correspondence with the Police that shows its investigated a fraud case. 
TransUnion didnt accept and said there was no evidence Mrs W was a victim of fraud and 
that the increased award was excessive. The investigator forwarded correspondence 
between Mrs W and the Police and TransUnion subsequently offered to increase the award 
to £150. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties agree that TransUnion merged Mrs Ws data with an unrelated third party. That 
means, Mrs W had access to information on her credit file that wasnt hers. In addition, it 
meant commitments that were unrelated to Mrs W were showing on her credit file. Mrs W 
has provided a screenshot from TransUnion that shows her credit score was poor during 
the period in question. Im please TransUnion took steps to correct its mistake. I understand 
this was a technical issue as a result of matching routines used by TransUnions systems. 
I need to decide how to fairly resolve Mrs Ws complaint. Mrs W has sent us lots of 
information that shows she tried to raise her concerns with TransUnion over the course of 
several months. The information includes an email Mrs W sent to TransUnion at the 
beginning of March 2021 and a response she received a short time later. TransUnions 
response said Mrs Ws concerns would be referred for investigation, but no further contact 
was received until she referred the matter to us. Mrs W first raised the issue with TransUnion 
at the start of March 2021 but it took five months for the issue to be investigated and 
resolved. Im satisfied that caused Mrs W a significant level of distress and frustration. Its 
clear Mrs W urgently wanted the matter to be looked into. 
Mrs W has provided evidence that shes referred an instance of fraud to the Police. Whilst I 
havent found anything that directly links TransUnions mistake to the fraud, Im satisfied Mrs 
W did report the matter as she claims. TransUnions response to the investigator says the 
information Mrs W provided doesnt show a fraud investigation was completed. 
Whilst the matter may not have been resolved yet, I dont doubt what Mrs W has told us and 
that this substantially increased the level of distress she experienced. 
Our investigator recommended TransUnion pay Mrs W £650 in recognition of the distress 
and inconvenience caused. In Mrs Ws case, Im satisfied the issues raised caused a 
substantial level of distress  compounded by the delays she experienced. Im satisfied £650 
fairly reflects the impact of the issues raised on Mrs W and is a fair way to resolve her 
complaint. As a result, Im upholding this complaint and awarding Mrs W £650. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited to 
pay Mrs W £650.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2022.
