The complaint
Mr K complains that HSBC UK Bank plc wont refund to him the deposit that he paid for a 
training course.
What happened
Mr K used his HSBC credit card in December 2020 to pay a £500 deposit for a training 
course that was due to begin in June 2022. He contacted the course provider in May 2022 
and asked to be put on a course with a later start date because of some personal problems. 
He says that he was told that that wasnt possible so he claimed a refund of his deposit from 
HSBC.
It said that it wasnt able to pursue his dispute as it had no chargeback rights because more 
than 120 days had passed since the date of the transaction. It also said that these events 
wouldnt constitute a breach of contract. Mr K wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She thought that the 
chargeback claim was raised in time but that it was reasonable for HSBC to conclude that 
Mr K wasnt entitled to a refund. She said that, even if HSBC had pursued the chargeback, 
she thought that the merchant could have presented a valid defence so she didnt think that 
HSBC had acted unfairly or unreasonably by not raising the chargeback. She wasnt 
persuaded that the merchant had breached its contract with Mr K by refusing to refund his 
deposit when he tried to change the date of the course so she didnt think that he would 
have a successful claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Mr K has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that he 
phoned the merchant 19 days before starting the course because he wanted to change the 
course date, but it didn't allow that. He says that he didnt breach the contract and didn't 
want to cancel the course but just wanted to change the date of the course to a date that 
was suitable for him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
HSBC didnt made a chargeback claim because it said that more than 120 days had 
passed since the date of the transaction  but the applicable scheme rules say that, 
in Mr Ks circumstances, a dispute must be processed no later than 120 calendar 
days from the date that he expected to receive the service  so I dont consider that it 
was too late for it have made a chargeback claim when Mr K contacted it in June 
2022;
although a right to make a chargeback claim existed under the scheme rules, I dont 
consider that there was a reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim being 
successful in these circumstances;
the course providers terms and conditions say: Course moves can only be made if 
there are more than 21 days before the course start date  but Mr K says that he 
phoned the course provider 19 days before starting the course because he wanted to 
change the course date  so that wasnt more than 21 days before the course start 
date and I dont consider that the course provider was required to change his course 
dates;
the terms and conditions also say: If you cancel after your cooling off period has 
expired, you will not be entitled to any refund of your deposit; and: Once paid, a 
deposit is non-transferrable and non-refundable  so I dont con sider that Mr K was 
entitled to a refund of his deposit;
Mr K had paid a £500 deposit for the course and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
he was entitled to change the dates of the course in May 2022 when he contacted 
the course provider or to receive a refund of the deposit;
if HSBC had made a chargeback claim for the £500 deposit that Mr K had paid to the 
course provider, I consider it to be more likely than not that the course provider would 
have defended the claim because Mr K wasnt entitled to a refund in accordance with 
its terms and conditions;
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances to have 
expected HSBC to have made a chargeback claim in these circumstances;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ks complaint about HSBC, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the course provider and that 
HSBCs response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mr Ks claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
HSBC said that the course providers decision not to allow Mr K to change the course 
dates wouldn't constitute a breach of contract and Im not persuaded that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the course provider in these 
circumstances;
I dont consider that it was unfair or unreasonable for HSBC to decline Mr Ks request 
for a refund of the £500 deposit that hed paid for the course; and
I sympathise with Mr K for the problems that hes experienced and the loss of his 
deposit, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require HSBC to refund to him the £500 that he paid to the course provider, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 January 2023.
