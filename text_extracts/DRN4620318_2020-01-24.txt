This complaint is about 7 loans Sunny provided to Miss A between  December 2016 and 
March 2018. Miss A borrowing history is as follows:

*This loan was provided while Miss A had at least one other loan outstanding which  
increased her highest repayment.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss As complaint  and thought loans 6 and 7 shouldnt  have been 
given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN46203182refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss A, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss As case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss A was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss A had taken out 6 loans within 14 months. Sunny says it 
carried out checks and Miss A had sufficient disposable income. But the number of 
loans Miss A had taken  means  Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than 
not Miss A was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan 
was leaving in her finances. Which in turn meant  that Miss As indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Miss As first loan was for £250  and loan 6 was for £200. Miss As debts were  also 
overlapping. At this point Sunny ought  to have known that Miss A was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss A was also given  loans  6 and 7 whilst she had an existing loan running with 
Sunny. Sunny says it allows customers to have to have a maximum of four loans up 
to a certain credit limit. But this still means Miss A had increased her borrowing and 
monthly outgoings and there was no indication her reliance on short term credit was 
coming to an end. 
Sunny  also says Miss A settled loans  early, which means  she wasnt  in financial 
hardship. But I dont  think this means Miss A was managing her finances effectively, 
and often early settlement of a loan can be an indication of issues with debt 
management. 
Ref: DRN46203183I think that Miss A lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss As indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss A borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss As ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 and 7 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Miss A loans  6 and 7.
A.)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Miss A towards  
interest, fees and charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third party  
where applicable, but not including anything it has already  refunded.
B.)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments 
made by Miss A which were considered as part of A, calculated from the 
date Miss A originally  made the payments,  to the date the complaint is 
settled.
C.)Sunny  should  pay Miss A the total of A plus B.
D.)The overall pattern  of Miss A borrowing  for loan 6 and 7 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from 
Miss As credit file. If Sunny has sold any of the loans you should ask the debt 
purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  You should  give Miss A a 
certificate showing  how much tax youve deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss As complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 February  2020.
