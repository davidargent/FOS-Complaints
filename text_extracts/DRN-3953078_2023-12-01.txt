The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as E complain that WorldPay Limited (WorldPay) unfairly and 
arbitrarily increased their card processing fees. E is also unhappy that certain charges 
WorldPay recovered from it were duplicated.
In bringing this complaint, E is represented by its director who Ill refer to as Mr B 
 
What happened
The background to this case is well known to the parties so, I wont repeat it in detail. 
Briefly:
In 2005 E signed a Merchant Services Agreement (the Agreement) with WorldPay to 
process card payments made by its customers. E was charged a fee of £219.95 plus 
VAT annually (the Fee).
WorldPay revised the Fee effective from 1 January 2021 and in October 2020 sent E 
a letter alerting it to the proposed change. 
From January 2021 onwards, E was required to pay a new amount of £100 plus VAT, 
on a monthly basis. 
However, in error WorldPay failed to terminate the old fee arrangement and this led 
to E being wrongly charged two sets of annual fees totalling £527.88.  
WorldPay acknowledged their error and refunded the overcharged amount. 
Furthermore, they gave a £50 credit to E as compensation for the inconvenience this 
caused.   
Mr B acknowledged WorldPay did put these concerns right. But he told WorldPay that theyd 
charged E other unexplained fees that were no part of the Agreement or the re-pricing which 
took effect in January 2021. 
So, E wanted WorldPay to refund all the fees that they had charged historically that werent 
part of the Agreement or the January 2021 repricing. 
WorldPay believed that under the Agreement they were entitled to increase the Fee. And 
they said having taken the action referred to above, they had done enough to put things right 
for E. They denied theyd charged other fees to which they werent entitled. 
Es complaint remained unresolved, and so, Mr B referred it to this service to look into. 
One of our investigators did so. To begin with he was satisfied that under term 4.4 of the 
Agreement, WorldPay were entitled to increase the Fee subject to appropriate notice being 
given to E. Having regard to WorldPays October 2020 notice, he was further satisfied that 
WorldPay did appropriately notify E of their intention to increase the Fee and therefore 
hadnt done anything wrong when they did so. 
With regard to the £527.88 that WorldPay had overcharged E in error, he was satisfied 
WorldPay had refunded the amount back to E. However, although noting that WorldPay had 
paid E £50 for the inconvenience caused by their error, he believed they should pay an 
additional £50 to better reflect that inconvenience. 
WorldPay accepted the investigators conclusions. But E, on the other hand didnt and has 
asked for a review of its case by an ombudsman
On its behalf Mr B has made a number of further points including what he regards as poor 
practice generally in the way WorldPay set about the increase in the Fee. 
He said  in summary that when in March WorldPay offered E compensation for the 
duplicated charge, theyd told him that this had happened because their system wasnt 
working as it should and would be fixed within two to three days. He doesnt believe 
WorldPay have made good on their promise because he says he has continued to 
experience problems when operating Es account.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete or inconclusive (as indeed some of it is here) I reach my 
decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to 
have happened in the light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Increase in the Fee
As noted above in January 2021 WorldPay increased the Fee. And I note E has described 
that decision as arbitrary and unfair.  
My starting point has been to look at the terms and conditions of the Agreement to determine 
whether WorldPay were entitled to take the action they did. Having done so Im satisfied that 
they were.
Section 4.4 of the Agreement says:
We may from time to time vary the Fees and/or introduce new charges in addition to 
the Fees, in accordance with clause 22.
Clause 22.3 says:
We shall be entitled to vary the provisions of the Agreement from time to time by 
giving you at least two (2) months' prior written notice. Such variations may be 
notified by reference to materials available on our website, as set out in clause 26.5. 
If we make changes to the terms and conditions herein affecting your payment 
services, you shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement immediately by providing 
written notice to us, PROVIDED THAT such notice is served upon us within two (2) 
months of you being notified of the variation. Otherwise, you will be deemed to have 
accepted any variation of the provisions of this Agreement two (2) months from being 
notified of it.In effect therefore under the Agreement WorldPay were entitled to vary the Fee. That 
included increasing it - subject to them giving E two months advance notice. Their October 
2020 letter to E did that. 
Against that background it is difficult for me to conclude WorldPays practice was poor. And 
neither have I been persuaded they acted unreasonably when they took the action they did. 
It follows I do not find that WorldPays decision to increase the Fee was arbitrary and neither 
do I find that by taking that decision E was treated unfairly. 
continued account problems.
I note what Mr B has said in this regard. And Im sorry to hear his testimony that Es account 
isnt functioning as he believes it should. However, I would say fresh problems relating to Es 
account are matters that should be raised with WorldPay to give them the opportunity to 
investigate them. 
overcharged fees
WorldPay have acknowledged that in error E was overcharged in the amount of £527.88 
mentioned above. So, they needed to put that right by refunding the amount to E. I note 
WorldPay have already done so. Therefore, Im not persuaded they should do anymore in 
that connection. That being said Mr B did have to raise the matter with WorldPay at some 
inconvenience to E. 
Putting things right
For the reasons given by the investigator, I agree that a further modest increase of £50 more 
appropriately compensates E for that inconvenience
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I 
recommend that WorldPay Limited pays E £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused to 
E. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
