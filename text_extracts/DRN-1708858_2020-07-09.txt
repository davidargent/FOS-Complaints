The complaint
Mr K has complained NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibility each time it increased his credit limit 
on his Aqua card.
What happened
Mr K opened an Aqua credit card account with NewDay in December 2011 with a credit limit 
of £500. Since the account opened, there have been seven increases to the credit limit until 
February 2016. The first three of these increases were requested by My K, but Mr K has 
complained about the four increases NewDay offered to him. 
The increases in credit limits that NewDay offered Mr K are:
December 2013 it increased from £1,550 to £2,300
October 2014 it increased from £2,300 to £3,450
August 2015 it increased from £3,450 to £4,500
February 2016 it increased from £4,500 to £5,850
NewDay says it reviewed Mr Ks affordability before each of these increases and is satisfied 
that Mr K passed its affordability checks. And it wrote to him offering him the chance to reject 
the increases before they were applied. Mr K accepted the increases on each occasion.
Mr K complained to NewDay on 12 August 2019. He said NewDay had increased his credit 
limits irresponsibly, and that he had used payday loans to meet his requirements because of 
his financial difficulties. NewDay told him that it didnt uphold his complaint because he had 
passed its financial difficulty assessment based on external credit bureau data. NewDay 
went on to explain that although Mr K now says he had borrowed money from a family 
member to pay a full balance owing, it hadnt known this at the time. And this wouldnt be a 
reason for it not to allow him further credit limit increases in the future, if he passed its 
affordability assessment.
Mr K referred his complaint to our service and an investigator looked into what happened.
The investigator said that NewDay is able to lend to customers with a certain credit status, 
but it would still need to lend responsibly, It did provide Mr K with an option to reject the 
increases, but the investigator said this doesnt make it fair to offer the increase in the first 
place if it hadnt carried out sufficient affordability checks.
The investigator suggested that NewDay should refund all interest and charges incurred as a 
result of the credit card limit increases from December 2013. And pay Mr K £100 for the 
trouble and upset it caused him. The investigator later clarified that the interest and charges 
refunded should also include 8% interest.
NewDay didnt accept the suggestion made by the investigator. It said its not required to 
review Mr Ks income and expenditure when it completes its affordability checks. And that it 
is generally accepted it can consider a customers modelled income, less all available 
discretionary and non-discretionary expenses and credit commitments. NewDay highlighted 
that Mr K is currently paying more than the contractual amount due, and Mr K hasnt 
contacted it for assistance.
NewDay says that it only became aware of payday loan data from March 2016, therefore it 
followed what was required of it before the final increase in the credit limit in February 2016. 
It says that the risk data it was provided, and the internal methods it used, are based on 
industry recognised methods. Additionally, it says it retains a history of how the customer 
has managed the account alongside any other accounts a customer holds under the 
NewDay portfolio. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it. Ill explain why.
When NewDay made the decision to offer Mr K a credit limit increase in December 2013, the 
preceding five statements show that Mr K was up to, and at times over, the agreed credit 
limit. This led to additional charges being applied to the account, and by this time the 
minimum monthly payment was £52.72. I consider this is a potential indicator a customer 
may be struggling to maintain existing commitments, and it should reasonably have 
prompted further enquiries.
NewDay says it isnt required to check the income and expenditure of a customer when 
considering an increase in a limit.
I accept NewDay decides how to set its lending criteria. However, having reviewed the Office 
of Fair Trading (OFT) Irresponsible Lending Guidance that was in place at the time of the 
first increase, I dont think the checks NewDay completed went far enough. I understand that 
NewDay may not have had full details of Mr Ks other credit at this time because of the 
nature of the credit checks it choose to complete. But I think it couldve completed other 
more proportionate checks, like asking to see his full credit file or completing a new income 
and expenditure assessment for example. The OFT guidance says a lender may use of a 
variety of sources of information which might include its existing records, evidence of 
income, evidence of expenditure and a credit report. 
I consider that Mr Ks circumstances suggested it wouldve been appropriate to do more 
checks than NewDay carried out. I say this because NewDay was already aware Mr K had 
recently exceeded his credit limit and additional charges had been applied. The credit report 
I have seen, shows that by November 2013, Mr K had obtained two further credit cards, and 
all three of his cards were operating at, or very near to their limits. Mr Ks expenditure on 
these cards was now at least £125 per month. 
Taking what Ive seen into account, I dont think the decision to approve the significant 
increase to £2,330 in December 2013, without checking income and expenditure, was a 
reasonable one. I think its likely that if NewDay had done better checks, in line with the OFT 
guidance at the time, it wouldnt have offered Mr K a significant increase in his credit card 
limit. A reasonable check wouldve shown he had three new credit cards already operating at 
their limits, and Mr Ks monthly credit commitments had increased significantly within a short 
period. The credit limit increase of 50% offered by NewDay in October 2014 was also a significant 
one. Again, NewDay did not take reasonable steps to assess the affordability of this 
increase. It did not request an up to date income and expenditure breakdown from Mr K.
I acknowledge NewDays view that between December 2013 and October 2014, Mr K had 
cleared his balance with it. But I have seen no evidence that NewDay sought to clarify 
whether this had come from income, savings or assets. Regardless of this, by October 2014 
Mr K was at 75% of his credit limit. And his credit report shows that his other two credit cards 
were close to their agreed limits, even though the balances had been reduced earlier the 
same year.
By the time of the subsequent increases, the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) section 
of the FCA Handbook gave information on how lenders should assess the creditworthiness 
of a borrower. The requirement in CONC 5.2 is to assess the customers creditworthiness 
when offering credit, and under CONC 5.3 this also applies to setting credit limits.  A key 
element of this is the customers ability to make repayments as they fall due (or within a 
reasonable period in the case of running-account credit such as a credit card or overdraft) 
but this is not a separate obligation. It is a part of assessing creditworthiness.
I think it wouldve been reasonable for NewDay to carry out better checks than it did at this 
time because, although the credit cards were being cleared at different times, Mr K quickly 
took them back, or near to, their limits again. Again, in such circumstances I wouldve 
expected NewDay to carry out an income and expenditure assessment, in line with the 
guidance in the FCA Handbook, but NewDay didnt do so. 
NewDay says it didnt know Mr K had borrowed money from a family member. However, the 
point here is that if NewDay had made suitable enquiries as to Mr Ks financial position, it 
could well have established that information. That would have enabled it to make a better-
reasoned decision on whether it was appropriate to significantly increase Mr Ks credit limit 
at this time. 
There were then two separate significant increases of 30% to Mr Ks credit limit in August 
2015 and February 2016. At these increases, NewDay didnt obtain a breakdown of income 
and expenditure. By this time, NewDay had increased Mr Ks credit limit from £1,550 to 
£5,850 without requesting an income and expenditure breakdown from Mr K. I consider it 
was inappropriate for NewDay to approve these increases without carrying out greater 
checks on Mr Ks affordability throughout this period.
I appreciate that Mr K is now paying NewDay an amount to reduce his debt that is over and 
above the minimum he is required to pay, but that doesnt mean that NewDay was prudent in 
offering Mr K these significant increases at the time. I have seen that Mr K later became 
more reliant on payday loans to help fund his existing repayments on his credit cards. 
Although NewDay says Mr K hasnt used the payday loans to fund essential spending, it is 
reasonably clear to me that the increases it provided led to his debts becoming more 
persistent and added to his financial difficulty. And he then used payday loans to help fund 
his credit.
Putting things right
Over a period of a little more than two years, between December 2013 and February 2016, 
NewDay increased Mr Ks credit limit almost fourfold, without carrying out sufficient checks 
on his ability to repay. During this time Mr Ks account conduct was displaying indications of 
a customer who was potentially in difficulty.Had NewDay made suitable checks, I think it would have become clear Mr K had more 
financial commitments and less disposable income than NewDay believed he had. In those 
circumstances, I consider it unlikely a responsible lender, acting reasonably, would have 
approved the credit limit increases. I therefore consider this is irresponsible lending and 
NewDay should put this right. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold Mr Ks complaint. I require NewDay Ltd to:
refund the interest and any charges incurred as a result of the credit card limits being 
increased from December 2013 to the present; 
pay 8% annual interest on the refunds and charges for the period; and 
pay Mr K £100 to recognise the distress this has caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 August 2020.
