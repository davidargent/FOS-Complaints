The complaint
Mr C complains about information he received from TenetLime Ltd about a life assurance 
policy held in a trust.
What happened
Mr C took out a term assurance policy in 2016. The sum assured  what it would pay out on 
a successful claim  was set at £160,000  a little more than Mr Cs mortgage at the time.
TenetLime offered a free service to put the policy in a trust. Mr C filled out a form to do that. 
He put his fianc and three adult children as the beneficiaries of the trust. That meant that if 
the policy paid out, theyd share the sum assured.
In September 2020, TenetLime appear to have made a follow up call to Mr C. He explained 
he wanted to change the trust. He wanted his wife to be the only beneficiary. The caller said 
to leave that with them to get it amended. In a later call, TenetLime said a form would be 
sent to Mr C by the policy provider, which he could then use to change the trust.
These calls also started an enquiry to change the sum assured of the policy. Mr C felt he 
needed a higher sum assured. But in October, Mr C told TenetLime hed decided to put that 
on hold as his income was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. TenetLime agreed to 
contact him again a few months later.
In February 2021, TenetLime and Mr C discussed the policy again. This time Mr C was put 
through to the policy provider to change the trust. But they explained that it couldnt be 
changed unless he cancelled his 2016 life policy and took out a new one.
Mr C wanted to complain that hed been given incorrect information previously. There was 
some discussion about getting a discount on a new policy  now with a higher sum assured. 
But the TenetLime adviser said it wouldnt be possible to change the policy while a complaint 
was being looked into.
TenetLime responded to the complaint in April 2021. They agreed theyd given Mr C 
incorrect information about changing the trust. To acknowledge the inconvenience caused 
by this, they offered Mr C £50 compensation. This wasnt accepted, so TenetLime increased 
their offer to £200 in June. That too wasnt accepted, and Mr C brought the matter to us.
Around the same time, Mr C also took out a new life assurance policy, through a different 
company. He chose a sum assured of £250,000, and I believe has set his wife to be the only 
beneficiary of it. But  believing he needed to keep the policy arranged by TenetLime to 
continue with his complaint  Mr C kept the 2016 life policy running. Mr C didnt cancel the 
2016 policy until May 2022. 
I looked at the complaint last month, and explained my provisional decision for it. I found the 
way the trust was initially set up reflected Mr Cs wishes at the time, rather than a mistake by 
TenetLime. But I found the information about changing the trust in 2020 hadnt been right. If 
it had been, I was satisfied Mr C would have cancelled his old policy sooner than he did. 
To put that right, I said TenetLime should reimburse Mr C for the cost of the 2016 policy for 
the period it overlapped with his new life policy  11 June 2021 to May 2022. And I said they 
should pay Mr C a total of £400 compensation for the upset and inconvenience caused. 
TenetLime didnt respond to my provisional decision, but Mr C did. He said hed definitely 
have cancelled his 2016 life policy sooner  in September 2020  if hed been better 
informed by TenetLime. And he asked what would happen if TenetLime didnt respond to my 
decision going forward. 
Ill address these points below, in my final decision for this case. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided my provisional decision is the right one for Mr Cs complaint. Ill 
repeat the key points, with a few minor additions to show how Mr Cs latest comments fit in 
with my reasoning.
Ive seen the trust document completed by Mr C in 2016. And Ive listened to a call he had 
with TenetLime that discussed his options when filling it in. From that I find that the initial set 
up of the trust seems to reflect what Mr C wanted to do at the time. I cant see TenetLime 
made any mistakes that led to the trust being set up incorrectly.
So I find TenetLime arent responsible for Mr C wanting to change the trust in later years. 
Nor are they responsible for the fact he needed to cancel the 2016 life policy to make the 
changes. That all flows from Mr Cs decisions when completing the trust form.
But  having listened to TenetLimes calls with Mr C in September 2020 and February 2021 
 I find there are problems with how TenetLime explained the situation to Mr C. They 
shouldnt have told him the trust could be changed. If theyd given him more accurate 
information  or if theyd put him in touch with the policy provider sooner  Mr C would 
probably have acted sooner to change his life policy and undo the trust hed set up.
Putting things right
I appreciate Mr C says hed have changed his policy in September 2020 if TenetLime had 
explained things better. But Mr C would have replaced it, much as hes done now. Which 
means hed have still been paying something to have the life cover he wanted. 
If the service had been reasonable hed likely have paid more for a new policy, because hed 
have set it up with the higher sum assured discussed with TenetLime in September 2020. 
Mr C had the opportunity to do that, but chose not to because of the increased cost.
So although I agree Mr C probably wouldnt have had the 2016 life policy as long as he did if 
the service had been reasonable, he isnt financially disadvantaged by that.
But the unclear information TenetLime gave Mr C in February 2021 does appear to have had 
a negative financial impact on Mr C. I dont agree the policy couldnt be changed while a 
complaint was being made. The two are separate processes  or they should have been in 
this case, at least. If TenetLime had been clearer about this with Mr C, hed likely have 
cancelled the 2016 life policy as soon as he took out the replacement for it.
I can see Mr C arranged his replacement in June 2021. So from that point, anything he paid for the 2016 policy wasnt needed. Mr C only paid it because of the incorrect information 
TenetLime gave him. So TenetLime should now act to reimburse Mr C for that expense.
I can see Mr Cs new policy began on 11 June 2021. Hes also confirmed his 2016 life policy 
ended in May 2022. So the premiums that would have been payable for that period should 
be covered by TenetLime.
In addition, Ive heard in the phone calls and seen in the complaint correspondence how 
upsetting and frustrating this situation has been for Mr C. That cant be undone, but Im 
compensation will at least acknowledge that it wouldnt have happened, if not for 
TenetLimes failings.
Ive thought about the scale of that impact here, and the amount of time its lasted. With 
those factors in mind, I find a payment of £400 is suitable in this case.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Cs complaint about TenetLime Ltd. To put things right, they should reimburse 
Mr C for the premiums he paid for the 2016 life policy from 11 June 2021 to its cancellation 
date in May 2022. And they should pay a total of £400 compensation to acknowledge the 
trouble and upset caused for Mr C.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2022. If he confirms he accepts the decision, itll 
become binding on TenetLime Ltd. That will mean they have to do as Ive said. If they dont, 
Mr C will be able to seek enforcement of the decision through the courts.
