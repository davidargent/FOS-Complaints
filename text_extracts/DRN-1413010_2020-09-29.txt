The complaint
Mrs H complains that TSB Bank plc wont refund to her the money that she paid, using her 
credit card, for some chairs that she says are faulty. Her representative is also involved with 
her complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs H used her TSB credit card in March 2018 to pay a total of £2,496 for four 
leather reclining chairs  the chairs were delivered in July 2018;
her representative contacted the supplier some months later because they were 
unhappy with the chairs so it sent an upholsterer to check the chairs and some 
screws on one of the foot rests were replaced  but that didnt rectify the issues;
the supplier then arranged an independent inspection of the chairs in November 
2018  the inspection report included photos of the chairs and concluded that there 
was no manufacturing fault and the puddling of leather on the seats and arms was 
well within tolerances;
Mrs H then complained to a retail ombudsman but her complaint failed so her 
representative arranged another inspection of the chairs  the report cost £50 and 
concluded that the chairs  are not up to standard and should be rejected as the 
quality of upholstery is so low;
Mrs H complained to TSB  it didnt uphold her complaint but credited her account 
with £50 to reimburse her for the cost of the report;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Hs complaint about TSB, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the chairs and that 
TSBs response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mrs Hs claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
I sympathise with Mrs H and her representative for the issues that they have with the 
chairs but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier or that TSBs response to 
their complaint has been unfair or unreasonable;
the chairs have been inspected twice  with very different findings, a complaint to the 
retail ombudsman has failed and, having reviewed the photos contained in the 
November 2018 inspection report, Im not persuaded that the puddling is enough to 
cause the chairs not to have been of satisfactory quality when they were supplied to 
Mrs H; and
I consider that TSBs response to Mrs Hs complaint has been fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to 
refund to her the money that she paid for the chairs, to pay her any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2020.
