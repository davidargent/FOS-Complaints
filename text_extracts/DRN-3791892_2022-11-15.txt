The complaint
Miss A complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Financial Services, wasnt of 
satisfactory quality.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in September 2022 in which I described 
what had happened as follows: 
A used car was supplied to Miss A under a hire purchase agreement with Audi 
Financial Services that she signed in February 2021. She complained to the dealer 
about some issues with the car, including a knocking noise. The car was repaired but 
the knocking noise continued so Miss A complained to Audi Financial Services. It 
upheld her complaint in August 2021 and agreed to deduct a monthly payment of 
£558.77 from the arrears on Miss As account but that wasnt actioned so she was 
sent arrears letters and then, in January 2022, it terminated the agreement so Miss A 
complained to this service.
The car was inspected in April 2022 and an engine noise issue and vibration were 
still present and required further investigation. Our investigator recommended that 
Miss As complaint should be upheld. He thought that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when supplied to Miss A and he recommended that Audi Financial Services 
should: collect the car, cancel the agreement; refund Miss As deposit; record the 
agreement as settled on her credit file and remove any adverse data reported to the 
credit reference agencies; pay her £200 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused; refund 5% of the paid instalments and deduct 5% of the 
unpaid instalments to reflect the impaired use (and agree a suitable arrangement 
with Miss A for repayment of the unpaid instalments); and pay interest on the 
refunded amounts.
Miss A says that she wants to keep the car and for her credit file to be cleared with a 
clear representation of what happened. Audi Financial Services says the car has to 
be returned as the agreements been terminated because payments were missed 
and adequate notice was given. It says that all concerns have been repaired or 
looked at and a slight engine rattle was confirmed in May 2022 but its not excessive 
and sounds like normal diesel rattle. It says that Miss A has no right to reject the car 
and that shes had good use of the car based on her usage of it. It says that its 
worked out that the approximate total owed by Miss A once the car is returned will be 
£3,961.63 and that shell also be liable for refurbishment and excess mileage 
charges as shes already 10,000 miles over her annual mileage.
I said in my provisional decision: I agree with our investigator that Miss As complaint should 
be upheld but I consider that Audi Financial Services should put things right in a different 
way, and my provisional findings are as follows:
Audi Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss A - whether or not it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, 
including the age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss A was about four years old, had been driven for 
29,600 miles and had a price of £34,490;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components 
within the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly 
how long that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Miss A complained to the dealer about some issues with the car soon after it was 
supplied to her and the car was repaired but some of the issues, including a 
knocking noise, continued;
Miss A complained to Audi Financial Services and it upheld her complaint but its 
final response letter to her in August 2021 made no reference to the ongoing 
issues with the car;
the car was inspected by an independent expert in April 2022 and the inspection 
report says: The engine noise and vibration are still present and further 
investigation is required to diagnose their cause with the appropriate repairs 
performed. The stored fault codes should be investigated and rectified as 
required  the cars mileage was recorded on the report as 46,799 miles;
Audi Financial Services says that the car was checked again in May 2022 and a 
slight engine rattle was confirmed but it wasnt excessive and sounds like normal 
diesel rattle and the engineer said that he wouldnt recommend any further 
repairs because of the repairs that had been carried out;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality 
when it was supplied to Miss A because of the issues with it  but Miss A says 
that she wants to keep the car and she was able to use it to drive more than 
20,000 miles between February 2021, when it was supplied to her, and April 
2022;
Audi Financial Services agreed to deduct a monthly payment of £558.77 from the 
arrears on Miss As account in August 2021 but that wasnt actioned so she was 
sent arrears letters  there have continued to be issues with the payments due 
under the agreement;
it says that Miss A was given adequate notice about the arrears on her account 
and that the agreement was terminated in January 2022 because payments were 
missed  it says that the car has to be returned as the agreements been ended 
but it sent an arrears notice to Miss A in June 2022 which said that she was 
behind on her payments under the agreement;
Im not persuaded that its fair or reasonable for the hire purchase agreement to 
have been terminated in these circumstances and I consider that Miss A should 
be allowed to continue to use the car on the terms set out in that agreement - but 
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Miss A to pay for the use that shes had 
from the car;
I consider that Audi Financial Services should reinstate Miss As agreement (or if 
its unable to do that it should treat the agreement as if it hadnt been terminated 
so that Miss A is able to continue to use the car on the terms and conditions set 
out in the agreement);
I consider that, if it hasnt already done so, Audi Financial Services should deduct 
a monthly payment of £558.77 from the arrears on Miss As account and that it 
should try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement with Miss A for the balance of the arrears - and, if a repayment arrangement is agreed, I consider 
that it should also remove any adverse information about the hire purchase 
agreement that its recorded on Miss As credit file;
if an affordable repayment arrangement isnt agreed or if Miss A doesnt make 
the agreed payments, I consider that its fair and reasonable for Audi Financial 
Services to take action to recover those amounts from her, to the extent that its 
legally entitled to do so, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the hire 
purchase agreement;
Miss A has been able to use the car to drive more than 20,000 miles and she 
wants to keep the car so Im not persuaded that her use of it has been impaired 
enough to justify a reduction in her monthly payments; and
these events have clearly caused distress and inconvenience for Miss A and I 
find that it would be fair and reasonable for Audi Financial Services to pay her 
£200 to compensate her for that distress and inconvenience.
Subject to any further representations from Miss A and Audi Financial Services, my 
provisional decision was that Miss As complaint should be upheld. Audi Financial Services 
says that it has nothing further to add. Miss A said that she was going to respond to my 
provisional decision but, despite being given more time to do so, hasnt made any further 
representations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Miss A hasnt made any further representations in response to my provisional decision 
and Audi Financial Services says that it has nothing further to add, I see no reason to 
change the findings that I set out in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Audi Financial Services 
to take the actions described in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint and I order Volkswagen Financial Services 
(UK) Limited, trading as Audi Financial Services, to take the actions described above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
