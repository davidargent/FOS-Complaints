The complaint
Mr H says Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, has provided unacceptable 
service on both his credit card and loan accounts.
What happened
Mr H is unhappy with a number of aspects of the service he has received from 118 118 
Money. His complaint points and the lenders response are summarised below.
Fraud on his card
Mr H says he was unable to freeze his card vis his 118 118 Money app after he had noticed 
fraudulent transactions. He is unhappy 118 118 Money did not call him to check certain 
transactions as he is registered with CIFAS (the credit industry fraud avoidance system).
118 118 Money says the fraudulent transactions Mr H identified were either not claimed, or 
were refunded promptly to Mr H. As he then asked for the account be closed a new card 
wasnt issued. It said being registered with CIFAS would not determine which transactions 
are checked, this would be down to its fraud prevention strategies. So it made no error in this 
regard. It had checked its systems and there was no record Mr H had tried to change the 
status of his card on the app. So it could not comment further on what had happened. But  
Mr H had suffered no financial loss or detriment.
Late payment on his loan
Mr H says he tried to get in touch in March 2022 as he wanted to change the payment date 
for his loan account. He says it was impossible to get through and the lender did not call 
back or respond to his emails. He incurred call costs of £180. As he couldnt speak to the 
lender until 26 March 2022 his payment was recorded as late and 118 118 Money reported 
this. Mr H wants the marker removing from his credit file. He told 118 118 Money he will 
withhold payment until it does this. 
118 118 Money says as Mr H did not talk to it about delaying the payment due on 28 March 
2022 until 26 March - after the direct debit process had started - it was too late to change the 
payment date. Had Mr H given more time it would have been able to help. It will not remove 
the late payment marker from March (or ongoing) as it is an accurate reflection of how he 
managed his account. 
Problems contacting 118 118 Money
118118 Money observed that Mr H had made 26 calls from around the end of March, and 
that there were no relevant calls or call attempts prior to 26 March 2022. Of the 26 calls, 
three resulted in a conversation and 23 were missed/abandoned - 9 of these were made out 
of hours in May and 9 were made on 19 April 2022 at around lunchtime which it accepts was 
a busy time. It says it does not have a call back system for abandoned calls. But there is no 
evidence that Mr H could not get through for the month prior to his March payment.  
His initial email was sent out of business hours so when Mr H called the next morning 118 
118 Money had not had the opportunity to respond. It said many of Mr Hs emails were 
responses to automated emails complaining about the service, but he had already raised a 
complaint and had been told it would take some time to investigate and respond. 118 118 
Money argues there was no need to continually respond to emails that contained no new 
information.
Mr H wants 118 118 Money to reimburse him for his call costs which he told the lender were 
£180. It argues there were other cost-free ways he could contact it, like online chat, and it is 
not responsible for his call costs.
Our investigator upheld Mr Hs complaint in part. He said with regards the fraud on the card 
118 118 Money had acted correctly. Similarly in the circumstances it was right the lender 
had reported the March late payment on the loan. However he did feel 118 118 Money could 
have better managed Mr Hs repeated emails by making it clear from the outset it would not 
be responding. He felt this would have minimised Mr Hs frustration. To compensate Mr H for 
this omission he instructed the lender pay him £50.
Unhappy with this assessment Mr H asked for an ombudsmans review. He said he wanted 
£250 compensation for all his calls, and he reiterated that he had spoken to the lender on 26 
March 2022 which was two days before his loan payment was due. His late payment should 
not be reported as missed. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am upholding Mr Hs complaint in part. 
I have carefully considered all of Mr Hs points, and listened to his call with our investigator 
about his findings and recommendation. In keeping with our role as an informal dispute 
resolution service, and as our rules allow, I will focus here on the key issues I find to be 
material to the outcome of Mr Hs complaint.
I find that 118 118 Money treated Mr H fairly when there were fraudulent transactions on his 
credit card account. After its intervention Mr H suffered no loss that I need to consider. And it 
has accurately explained to Mr H the role of CIFAS, versus its role, in preventing fraud so I 
need not repeat that here.
With regards the March loan payment, the lender and the investigator have explained to    
Mr H that 26 March was too late to request more time as the process to collect a direct debit 
starts three days before the due date. It follows the payment was late and it was fair for this 
to be reported. The terminology of late or missed differs between the credit reference 
agencies but that is outside the control of 118 118 Money. And from the call history 118 118 
Money has provided there is no evidence that Mr H had tried to call but couldnt get through 
before the 26 March. I find there are no grounds to instruct 118 118 Money to change what it 
has reported on Mr Hs credit file. 
The fact Mr H made 26 attempted calls between 26 March and 22 May 2022 is not in 
dispute, but I can see no reason that 118 118 Money should cover the associated costs. 
Around a third of the calls were made out of business hours and another third at a peak time. 
I dont think it is unreasonable for 118 118 Money to suggest that Mr H could have tried a 
free contact channel such as webchat, or tried to call at times other than the predictably busy 
lunch hour. I agree that rather than just not replying to Mr Hs repeated emails 118 118 Money ought to 
have explained it would not continue to respond, and by not doing so it caused some 
avoidable distress and inconvenience. Similarly if it could not make an agreed call back it 
should have let Mr H know. I find £50 to be fair compensation for this.
I understand 118 118 Money is now working with Mr H to agree an affordable payment plan 
for his loan. I would urge Mr H to provide the information it requests, if he has not already. I 
would remind 118 118 Money of its obligation to treat Mr H fairly and with forbearance. 
Putting things right
118 118 Money should pay £50 compensation directly to Mr H.
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Hs complaint in part. Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, 
must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2023.
