K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as QuickQuid was irresponsible when it 
provided a number of loans  to him.
background
Mr G took ten loans with QuickQuid between December  2011 and March 2013. Ive 
prepared the table below from some of the information QuickQuid has provided about  Mr Gs 
loans.

10 18/02/13 £1,050
10A 10/03/13 £30007/12/15
The loans were  payday loans repayable over one or two periods. Additional principal was 
advanced on Loans 8 and 10 before the original loans were repaid: these are shown  on the 
table as 8A and 10A. In addition to further  principal  being advanced the terms of the loans 
were also extended.
QuickQuid objected to this Service looking into Mr Gs first five loans. It said hed complained 
too late. Our adjudicator explained why she thought we could look into those loans. 
QuickQuid is aware  of our approach and hasnt  provided anything new for me to consider. 
So I'm looking at the merits  of Mr Gs complaint  about his loans.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Gs complaint  about Loans 1 and 6. But she recommended  
that his complaint about Loans  2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 be upheld.  QuickQuid  doesnt  agree 
with our adjudicator  about those loans. Mr G hasnt raised any concerns about our 
adjudicators assessment  in respect of the loans she didnt uphold.  So it seems he accepts 
her view and the only loans in issue are those upheld by our adjudicator   Loans 2 to 5 and 
Loans 7 to 10. Those are the loans I am making  my decision on. If Mr G accepts this final 
decision it will be binding  on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN22160182I have thought about what QuickQuid  has told us in response to our adjudicators  
recommendation but Im satisfied that Mr Gs complaint about the loans in issue  should be 
upheld for broadly similar reasons to those found by our adjudicator.  I realise that QuickQuid 
will be disappointed but I hope that my explanation  below will help it understand why I've 
reached my decision.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make 
sure Mr G could repay his loans in a sustainable  manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly  demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
The regulator at the time Mr G took his loans  was the Office of Fair Trading  (OFT). It said 
that sustainable  meant  that a borrower  could repay  the credit:
without undue difficulty  in particular without incurring or increasing  problem 
indebtedness
over the life of the credit agreement 
out of income  and/or  available savings
The OFT added that it regarded without undue difficulty  as meaning that a borrower could 
make repayments whilst also meeting other debt repayments and other normal/reasonable 
outgoings and, without having to borrow further  to meet  these repayments.
Mr G declared  that his monthly  income  was £2,200  throughout the time he was borrowing 
from QuickQuid. I havent  seen any evidence that QuickQuid  asked  him about his outgoings.
Immediately on repaying Loan 1, Mr G applied for Loan 2. Loan 2 was for double  the amount  
and Mr G also increased the period of this loan - Loan 1 had been for 17 days: Loan 2 was 
for 32 days.  The amount to be repaid was £1,000. This represented a significant  proportion 
of Mr Gs declared income. In the absence of any indication of Mr Gs expenses QuickQuid 
didnt know how much disposable income he had from which to repay Loan 2. But, given the 
information it did have,  I think it shouldve realised that it was highly  likely  that Mr G wouldnt 
have been able to meet the repayment in a sustainable  way. 
Indeed Mr G came back for Loan  3 only four days after he repaid Loan 2  which  suggests 
that he was potentially becoming  reliant on these short term loans. I note that Mr G repaid 
Loan 3 on the same day he took it so he didnt  pay any interest  on it. This is an unusual 
pattern of borrowing and in itself shouldve alerted QuickQuid  to question further what  was 
going on with Mr Gs finances. 
Five days later Mr G borrowed  Loan 4. I accept  that this was for a lower  amount but Mr G 
wanted to repay it over an even longer period through two instalments. Loan 5 was for the 
highest amount  so far - £850 - again repayable through two instalments.  The highest of 
these was over £1,060.  
I'm satisfied that the amounts being  borrowed  and the pattern of borrowing was such that 
there was a significant risk that Mr G  wouldnt be able to repay  his loans sustainably. So 
QuickQuid wasnt responsible when it provided Loans 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Ref: DRN22160183I'm not looking into Loan 6. But I note that on the day Mr G repaid  it, he took Loan 7. This 
loan was for £1,250. It was due to be repaid  over 62 days through two instalments  of 
£312.50 and £1,562.50.  This second  instalment  was going to take up almost three-quarters  
of Mr Gs declared income. Again I'm satisfied that it wasnt realistic to think  hed be able to 
repay this by sustainable means. 
I also note that this was Mr Gs seventh  loan in less than a year.  Broadly speaking the 
amounts he was borrowing were increasing.  And I think this pattern of borrowing suggested  
that that Mr G had now become persistently reliant  on these short-term loans such that he 
was using them to plug gaps in his finances caused  by having to repay earlier  loans. The 
purpose of this type of loan was to act as a short-term solution to temporary  cash flow 
problems. They werent appropriate for supporting sustained borrowing over longer periods. 
It became even clearer that Mr G wasnt able to manage his finances successfully when a 
day after he borrowed Loan 8 (£700) he came back to QuickQuid to borrow  a further £650  
and he extended  the term. At the end of January 2013 he was due to repay  nearly £1,700.
Mr G extended Loan 8 and eventually repaid it around two weeks later than had originally  
been agreed. A day later he took Loan 9 and on the same day he repaid that he took 
Loan 10 - which  he again  topped up. By the time Mr G took Loan 10A hed taken  seven 
advances in four months during which time there were only 2 days when he didnt owe 
something to QuickQuid. Mr G struggled  to repay  Loan 10 which was eventually settled in 
2015.
With all this in mind, I'm satisfied that the repayment of these loans (Loans 7 to 10A)  wasnt  
likely to be sustainable for Mr G. And they had the effect of unfairly  prolonging his 
indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period  of time. The number of loans was also likely to have  had other negative 
implications such as Mr Gs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans. 
In summary  I'm upholding Mr Gs complaint about  Loans 2 to 5 and Loans 7 to 10A.
putting things right
Im satisfied that QuickQuid wasnt responsible when it provided  a number of loans to Mr G. 
So to put things right, I require QuickQuid to:
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on Loans 2 to 5 (taken between 
30 December 2011 and 31 May 2012) and Loans  7 to 10A (taken between 
30 November 2012 and 10 March 2013)
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information  in Mr Gs credit  file as regards Loans  2 to 5
the number  of loans taken from 30 November  2012 (Loan  7) onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans approved 
from this point onwards  should  be removed from Mr Gs credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give Mr G a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN22160184my final decision
For the reasons  given  above I'm upholding Mr Gs complaint in part and I require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right in the way I've outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 September 2019.
