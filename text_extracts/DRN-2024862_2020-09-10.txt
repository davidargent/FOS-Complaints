The complaint
Mr H says Morses Club PLC (Morses) irresponsibly lent to him. Mr H says the lending was 
unaffordable for him.
What happened
This complaint is about nine home collected credit loans provided to Mr H between March 
2015 and February 2019. There were some earlier loans but the complaint about them was 
brought to us too late under the time limits that apply. There are two chains of lending and 
Mr Hs borrowing history is as follows:

* Morses bought another business in February 2019 and these loans were provided by the 
other business. But Morses is taking responsibility for the lending. Of those three loans, the 
two loans annotated with ** means Morses wasnt able to locate any information about them 
so has already made an offer to Mr H. I have included them within the table as they are part 
of the borrowing relationship Mr H had with Morses. 
For ease of reference I will refer to the loan numbers I have highlighted under the loan 
column  so loans one to eight  rather than the business loan reference numbers. 
Our adjudicator reviewed Mr Hs complaint and thought that loans two to five and loan eight 
should be upheld. The adjudicator said this because they thought the loans were 
unaffordable because the repayments accounted for a significant proportion of Mr Hs 
income. They also thought that the lending taken after May 2018 was unsustainable so any 
information about them should be removed from Mr Hs credit file. 
Morses didnt fully agree with the adjudicator. But it did agree to make an offer for loans four 
and five and loan eight which we put to Mr H but he didnt wish to accept it. It didnt agree 
that loans two and three should be upheld.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for a decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Morses was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Morses has already offered to uphold the two loans for which it couldnt locate any 
information  loans six and nine. And further to the adjudicators assessment it has agreed to 
make an offer for loans four and five and loan eight. Mr H didnt comment on the 
adjudicators findings that loan one shouldnt be upheld. As theres no outstanding 
disagreement on these loans I wont be making any findings on them. But I have borne them 
in mind when considering the other loans Mr H took. So, the outstanding loans for my 
consideration are loans two and three. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. Having done so, I am upholding the complaint. 
Ill explain why. 
Morses has given us details of the income and expenditure checks it carried out before 
lending to Mr H. Mr H had a relatively low income which were in the form of benefits. For 
loan two Mr Hs weekly income was recorded as £90. Mr Hs expenditure was recorded as 
£15 and the weekly repayment for the loan was £15. This represented 17% of Mr Hs weekly 
income or 20% of his disposable income. I think this is too high a proportion of Mr Hs 
income. The loan was to be repaid over a 20-week term  eight months  so I dont think it 
would be unforeseeable that Mr H could experience some additional and unexpected 
expenditure during that time. I think there was a significant risk the lending would prove to be 
unsustainable. 
For loan three Mr Hs income was recorded as being £100 and his expenditure was £20. The 
loan repayment of £15 per week represented 15% of his weekly income or 19% of his 
disposable income. And this loan was to run for 33 weeks, or over eight months. Bearing this 
in mind I think it left Mr H with very little flexibility in the event of unforeseen additional 
expenditure. And bearing in mind the source of Mr Hs income it would seem unlikely that he 
would have been in the position to increase the level of income. 
So, I think its likely that the lending was unaffordable for Mr H and was likely to become 
unsustainable for him. And I note that loan three was taken the same day that loan two was 
repaid and it was for a larger amount. It looks like loan two was repaid before the agreed 
term so it may have been the case that Mr H was using part of the sum he borrowed at loan 
three to make a final repayment for the loan two which would indicate the lending was 
already becoming unsustainable for him. 
In conclusion, for the reasons given above, I dont think loans two and three should have 
been given.
Putting things right
For completeness, I have included the loans I have upheld  loans two and three plus the 
other loans that Morses has already agreed to uphold;
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans two to six and loans eight and 
nine;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans two to four;the number of loans taken from loan five onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans five and six and loans eight and 
nine should be removed from Mr Hss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to take off tax from this interest. Morses must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Morses Club PLC should put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2020.
