K821x#15complaint
Mr D doesnt think Barclays Bank UK Plc (Barclays) has paid him fair compensation in 
response to a complaint about  the sale of a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
background
Mr D took out a PPI policy with a credit card in June 1994. He cancelled the policy  in 2004.
In October  2011, Mr D contacted Barclays to say the policy  had been mis-sold.
But it wasnt  until Mr D contacted Barclays again  in September 2012  that Barclays  
investigated his complaint.  It wrote to Mr D on 14 November 2012  to say it didnt think the 
policy had been  mis-sold   and told him he could  refer his complaint to our service if he 
disagreed.
Mr D didnt refer his complaint to us. Instead,  he wrote to Barclays  again in March 2013. It 
doesnt look like Barclays replied to this letter.
In April 2015, a claims  management company contacted Barclays  on behalf of Mr D to say 
that the PPI policy  had been mis-sold. In June 2015, Barclays sent it a copy of the letter it 
sent Mr D in November  2012.
Barclays wrote to Mr D on 11 September 2015  to say it had conducted an additional review  
of his complaint.  It asked  Mr D to verify  his address   and asked  again  in a letter dated 
21 September 2015.
Mr D replied on 26 September 2015, providing  a list of the places hed lived.
Apparently in error, Barclays wrote to Mr D on 6 October 2015  to say it hadnt  received a 
reply to its earlier letters and told him it had closed his complaint.
It doesnt look like Mr D took any further  action until 6 November 2018, when he contacted  
Barclays to again  complain that the PPI policy was mis-sold. This time, Barclays upheld 
Mr Ds complaint. It refunded the PPI premiums  (£910.80), the interest charged on those  
premiums (£4,299.89)  and any fees caused  by PPI (£479). And it paid Mr D simple  interest  
(at 8% per year) on any extra he paid,  for the time he was out of pocket (£3,039.15). In total, 
Barclays paid Mr D £8,121.01 (after tax).
Mr D says he paid more  than this for PPI. And he thinks Barclays should pay him additional 
compensation because of the way it has handled his complaint.
Our adjudicator thought Barclays had refunded everything Mr D had paid for PPI. But he 
recommended Barclays  pay Mr D an extra £250  because of the way it had handled his 
complaint.
Barclays agreed to do this  but Mr D disagreed  with our adjudicators conclusions, so the 
complaint has been passed to me.
Ref: DRN71348562my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think Barclays has offered Mr D fair compensation. Ill explain why.
Barclays has sent us a month-by-month breakdown showing  how it has calculated Mr Ds 
compensation.
On one side of the page,  it shows what happened  each month. It shows:
how much Mr D owed  on his credit card account;
how much he was charged in interest, for PPI and in fees;  and,
how much he paid.
On the other side of the page,  it shows what might have happened if Mr D hadnt had PPI. 
Barclays has removed the PPI premium and recalculated the interest  each month to reflect 
the lower balance. Its also refunded any fees that Mr D would not have incurred if he hadnt 
had PPI. Finally, its added simple interest (at 8% per year) when Mr D paid more than he 
would have done if he hadnt had PPI, from the date of each payment.
This is sometimes  called  an account  reconstruction.
Mr D applied for his credit  card in June 1994  and he took out PPI at the same  time.
Barclays has all the information it needs  to do an account reconstruction from 1 May 2001 
onwards. But it doesnt  have any statement data before this. I dont think  this is 
unreasonable as I wouldnt expect a business  to keep this type of information indefinitely.
Barclays has therefore assumed Mr Ds balance increased steadily from about £530 when 
he opened the account in June 1994 to just under £1,200 in April 2001. Its assumed the 
monthly PPI premiums and interest charges reflected his estimated balances, and has 
reconstructed the account  accordingly, to remove the effects of PPI. In other words, its offer 
reflects its best guess  at what Mr D paid for PPI (including interest) between June 1994 and 
April 2001 (based on assumptions)  and May 2001  onwards (based on what  it knows).
Mr D doesnt think his compensation includes what he paid for PPI before May 2001. I 
assure him it does.  
He also says he always maintained a high balance on his credit  card.  I can see that Mr Ds 
balance has exceeded  £5,000 since the start of 2011. But before this, he had a much 
smaller balance. Between May 2001  and May 2003, the first two years of known statement 
data, Mr Ds average balance was just over £1,000   and for nine months it was less than 
£900. As Ive explained above, Barclays has assumed Mr Ds balance increased steadily 
from about £530 to just under £1,200. In the circumstances, I think this is fair.
All things  considered, I think the way Barclays has calculated Mr Ds PPI compensation is 
fair.
Finally, Barclays  has offered to pay Mr D £250 for any trouble and upset caused by the way 
its handled his complaint.  
Ref: DRN71348563Above, Ive included a brief summary of whats happened in this case.  Its clear  Barclays 
made mistakes. But Barclays  told Mr D he could refer his complaint to our service  when it 
wrote to him in November  2012  and he chose  not to do so until very recently. And he waited 
a long time, sometimes years, between letters to Barclays. So I dont think Barclays alone is 
responsible for the delays in this case and I think £250 is fair compensation  for any trouble 
and upset caused.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I think Barclays Bank UK Plc has paid Mr D fair 
compensation for the mis-sale of the PPI policy. But it should pay him £250 to compensate 
him for any trouble and upset caused by the way it has handled his complaint  as it has 
offered to do.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.
