The complaint
Mrs Q and Mr Q complain that they do not owe Santander UK Plc (Santander) £147.81.
What happened
Mrs Q and Mr Q had a personal loan of £3,000 from Alliance and Leicester  and the loan 
was acquired by Santander in 2010 when it took them over. The loan was repayable over 24 
months from July 2008. Santanders records show that the last payment of £144.16 was 
made in June 2010. In October 2010, records show there were two months arrears of 
£288.32. In 2011, there was a PPI refund of £140.51, leaving a balance of £147.81. 
Mrs Q and Mr Q complained that the monthly direct debit was cancelled by Santander in July 
2010. And they then paid one instalment in the branch. After the PPI refund, there was 
nothing to pay. They also complained that a notice of arrears was sent to Mrs Q  although 
the loan was in joint names, and theyd also been sent an internal email by Santander  
which was unprofessional and questioned whether there had been a breach of data.
In November 2019, Santander said the matter had been raised several times over the years, 
and their response was the same  that the money was owed. The loan was opened in July 
2008, to be paid by monthly repayments of £144.16 - 22 payments were made, leaving two 
outstanding. After a PPI refund of £140.51, the balance was £147.81. Santanders letter 
gave Mrs Q and Mr Q new referral rights to this service  so we can consider this complaint, 
even though the events were more than six years before.
Mrs Q and Mr Q brought their complaint to us. Our investigator said that Santander had 
acted fairly. Theyd told Mrs Q and Mr Q in 2013 and 2014 that the money was owing, 
including their final response to Mrs Q and Mr Qs complaint at that time. And over the years, 
theyd been consistent in saying the money was owed. Their records showed this also. And 
Mrs Q and Mr Q couldnt produce evidence that an instalment had been paid in the branch in 
2010. She said that while an internal memo had been sent to Mrs Q and Mr Q in error, there 
wasnt any evidence that Santander had shared any data with another party. And, the notice 
of arrears had been sent to Mrs Q correctly.
Mrs Q and Mr Q didnt agree and asked that their complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs Q and Mr Q argue very strongly that they dont owe the money. They are certain that 
they paid an instalment of £144.16 in the branch in July 2010. They thought the matter had 
been closed off after so long. They also said that Santander had acted unprofessionally in 
sending a copy of an internal email to them and questioned whether the Notice of Sums in 
Arrears dated May 2019 and sent to Mrs Q was compliant with regulations.
Ive seen the strength of feeling that Mrs Q and Mr Q have about this matter, but equally, I 
must look at what happened from an impartial standpoint. It really comes down to what 
happened in the summer of 2010. Santanders records  which Ive seen  show that the last 
payment of £144.16 was made in June 2020. This left a balance of £288.32  two payments. 
Then, in 2011, a PPI refund of £140.51 reduced this to £147.81. Ive seen that Santander 
consistently communicated this outstanding balance to Mrs Q and Mr Q. In April 2015, 
October 2015, May 2019, October 2019 and October 2020 they sent a Notice of Sums in 
Arrears showing the balance of £147.81. And in March 2013, June 2013 and October 2014, 
they wrote to Mr Q to say the same.
Ive looked at Santanders customer notes also. They show that in September 2010 through 
to November 2010, Mr Q called Santander about the arrears  he disputed the amount then, 
although its recorded that he said he would pay the two months instalments less PPI 
insurance  so a net £170 was to be paid. But  theres no mention of Santander advising 
him to pay in an amount at the branch at the time. And theres nothing in Santanders 
records that show that anything was paid into the loan in 2010. There arent any more notes 
on the account until 2013  when the first complaint was raised.
Unfortunately, Mrs Q and Mr Q havent got a receipt or other proof that the amount was paid 
at a branch in July 2010.
On the two other matters  I agree theres no evidence that Santander breached Mrs Q and 
Mr Qs data when they sent a copy of an internal email to them. On the other complaint  
that Mrs Q was sent a Notice of Sums in Arrears  when the loan was in joint names. Ive 
looked at the terms and conditions of the loan in 2008  and it says that they are jointly and 
severally liable  so they are liable together and individually  so on that basis, Santander 
were correct in sending the notice to either Mrs and Mr Q jointly, or individually.
So  on the balance of evidence  my decision is that Santander have acted reasonably. I 
know Mrs Q and Mr Q will be disappointed by this, but all I can suggest is that they now pay 
off the balance of the loan. I wont be asking Santander to do anymore here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs Q and Mr Q to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 July 2021.
