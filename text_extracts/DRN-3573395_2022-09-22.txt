The com
plaint  
Mr T c
omplains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) treated him unfairly when he tried 
to withdraw money from his current account.  
What h
appened  
In March 2022, Mr T visited a NatWest branch to withdraw £5,000.
Before releasing the funds, NatWest asked Mr T what the money was for. Mr T said it was
for a holiday he was going on the following day.
Because the withdrawal was for a large sum, NatWest said it needed evidence of theholiday, such as a flight ticket so it could satisfy itself the withdrawal was genuine.
As Mr T couldnt provide this, NatWest limited the withdrawal to £2,000.
Mr T was unhappy that hed been asked questions and that only a partial withdrawal wasallowed. So, he complained that NatWest had treated him unfairly.
NatWest said its entitled to ask questions about large withdrawals, and it does so toprotect consumers from scams and fraud. It said it had acted in line with its terms and
conditions and so it didnt think it had treated Mr T unfairly.
Mr T brought a complaint to this service.Our investigator considered it and was satisfied NatWest had acted fairly.
Mr T remained unhappy and felt NatWest had discriminated against him because of hisrace.
So, t
he complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What I
ve decided  and why  
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats  fair and  
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I note Mr T raised concerns about racial discrimination after the complaint was referred tous but for completeness, I have considered this. In doing so, Im taking into considerationthe relevant law.
The current account terms and conditions are the starting point  which say: Well always
follow your instructions, unless: [] we reasonably suspect your instruction is connected
to a scam, fraud or any other crime, or we reasonably consider that your instruction is of a
type where there is a high risk of there being such a connection; your instructions are
unclear or incomplete; []
On its website NatWest says it has a duty to keep customers safe and secure, and that it
will ask questions about the purpose of a cash withdrawal, and in some cases, for
DRN-3573395supporting documentation to help validate a withdrawal as genuine. This is particularly the 
case for large transactions  namely, those over £2,000.  
As Mr T was seeking to withdraw £5,000 
and considering NatWests obligation to protect its customers - I think it was fair for
NatWest to ask him questions about the withdrawal and for supporting evidence.
Giv
en Mr T was due to travel abroad the next day, it was reasonable for NatWest to have
expected him to be able to easily evidence his upcoming holiday by showing a flight ticket.
As he couldnt provide this, NatWest couldnt validate the withdrawal. And so, I think itwas reasonable for NatWest to deem the instruction unclear or incomplete and limit the
withdrawal to £2,000.
I note that in a phone conversation the next day - when discussing what the withdrawal
was for - Mr T said it was both for a holiday to be taken in April and to purchase illegal
goods. Given the conflicting informati on  and the concerns about illegal activity  it was
reasonable for NatWest to have continued concerns about what the money was to beused for.
There
s nothing in the available evidence to suggest Mr T was asked questions and his
withdrawal refused because of his race. Rather, what Ive seen is that NatWest hasfollowed its published approach which is applicable to all consumers .
In su
mmary, Im satisfied NatWest handled Mr Ts request to withdraw funds fairly and I
wont be asking it to do anything else.
My final decision  
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under
 the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or reject 
my decision before 20  October  2022.
