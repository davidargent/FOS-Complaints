K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly lent to 
him.
background
Mr D took three loans with 118 118 Money. He says he believed 118 118 Money did enough 
before lending loan 1 but complains that it shouldnt have lent him loans 2 and 3. One of our 
adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought that 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent 
loan 2 but didnt recommend that loans 1 and 3 should  be upheld.
From the information we hold on file, the loans were as follows:
Loan  
number Start dateLoan 
amount (£)TermRepayment 
amount
(£) End date
1 07/09/2015 3,000 24 months 233.40 12/05/2016
2 12/05/2016 3,296 24 months 253.20 01/09/2016
3 09/10/2018 3,000 24 months 235.09 Outstanding
Mr D disagreed saying  he wasnt in a position to sustainably repay loan 3. 118 118 Money  
agreed with the adjudicators opinion and offered redress on loan 2.
There are no continuing  disputes about  loans 1 and 2 and so Ive focused my decision on 
loan 3.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing without it 
significantly adversely  impacting  on their financial situation. 
There was a gap of more than two year between when Mr D repaid loan 2 and when he was 
lent loan 3. 118 118 Money  agrees  that it didnt carry out sufficient checks before lending  
loan 2, the adjudicator found that had 118 118 Money carried  out sufficient checks, its likely 
to have found that Mr D was gambling  excessively at the time.  But as 118 118 Money didnt 
carry out enough checks, it was unaware of Mr Ds gambling from loan 2.
118 118 Money searched Mr Ds credit  file and asked him about his income  and expenditure 
before lending loan 3. The result  of 118 118 Moneys  search of Mr Ds credit  file shows  that 
he had active defaults  two recorded in 2013 and another 2 in 2014. Mr D also had a 
recently delinquent account within the last 12 months with a balance of around  £5,490.  Mr D 
was also in arrears on his credit card payment Mr D declared his monthly income as £2,200 
and his regular  living costs including regular credit  commitments were around  £980.
Ref: DRN12756652I think given what 118 118 Money  saw on Mr Ds credit file and the length  of time he would  
have been committed  to repaying  this loan, 118 118 Money should have taken its checks  
further to get a clear picture of Mr Ds financial  circumstances. It would have been 
reasonable for 118 118 Money  to independently  verify some of the information  Mr D 
provided.
Mr D has provided copies  of his bank statement from the time. Ive placed considerable 
weight on the evidence on Mr Ds bank statement around September  2018  as I think  this is 
what 118 118 Money would likely have seen. I dont  think its likely to have seen transaction  
in October 2018  before  agreeing to lend loan 3. From what  I can see, Mr Ds income  in 
September 2018, was £2,732.19, more than he had declared to 118 118 Money from what  I 
can make  it seems Mr Ds normal living costs  and regular credit commitments  were around 
£1,000, this included things like rent, utilities and food. I can also see from the credit file that 
Mr D was around £337 to other creditors. The bank statements also show that Mr D had 
gambling transactions of around  £395.  The suggests that Mr D could afford  the loan.
Mr D disagrees  with the finding that this loan wasnt  wrongly  lent saying that he was still 
gambling and there  were  several gambling transactions on his bank statements. Mr D also 
says within  a few days of receiving his wages, his account balance  was £0.05 and so he 
couldnt sustainably  repay the loan.
Ive thought carefully about Mr Ds submissions and Im mindful of 118 118 Money being 
unaware of his gambling around the time of loan 2. Im also mindful that there  was more than 
a two-year gap between  when Mr D repaid  loan 2 and when he requested loan 3. These 
factors taken together  wouldnt have put 118 118 Money on notice  that hed been gambling  
significant sums in the past and that his financial circumstances  hadnt  improved.
While Mr Ds gambling transactions for the relevant month here was low and within Mr Ds 
scope to afford the loan, Ive also considered Mr Ds gambling in the two months before the 
loan to see if there was a concerning pattern of excessive gambling 118 118 Money should 
have been aware  of. In the three months  before  the loan was approved,  Mr D spent around 
£853 and £550 in July and August respectively. Given  that Mr Ds regular expenses 
remained roughly  the same in this period and his income was between  £2,293  and £2,732, 
I dont think the pattern  here was excessive  to the point that 118 118 Money  should  have 
concluded that he couldnt afford the loan.
I appreciate that my findings  are likely  to disappoint Mr D as it appears,  he feels strongly 
about this loan but based on the information 118 118 Money would  likely  have  seen, I dont 
think it was wrong to lend loan 3 in the circumstances. I hope my explanation will go some 
way in helping  Mr D understand why Ive reached  these  conclusions.
putting things right  what 118 118 Money  needs  to do
To put things right for Mr D, 118 118 Money  should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 2; and
add interest at 8% simple per year on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement*;
Ref: DRN12756653if theres still an outstanding  balance  on loan 3, 118 118 Money  may offset  the 
outstanding balance from the settlement above and agree a suitable payment plan for 
loan 3 if required.
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ds credit  file as a result of the interest 
and charges on loan 2.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires  118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 Money 
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ds complaint  in part and require Madison CF UK Limited to put things right as 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 March  2021.
