The complaint
Mr C complains about a declined claim with PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA made through 
its Buyer Protection Programme.
What happened
In July 2019 Mr C purchased a television through a third party site, that he says wasnt as 
described. After contacting the seller and arranging to return the television through the third 
party site, Mr C says he arranged the collection and delivery of the item. After waiting some 
time for a refund with no success, Mr C asked PayPal to step in and resolve the dispute via 
their Buyer Protection Programme. 
PayPal looked into the dispute, and after contacting the seller and checking Mr Cs delivery 
confirmation, decided not to uphold the dispute. It said Mr C hadnt followed the terms and 
conditions of the return, namely using a delivery company that had an online confirmation of 
the returned item. The seller also told PayPal the goods hadnt been received back. 
Mr C remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked 
into the complaint but didnt uphold it. She said that PayPals terms and conditions are clear 
in that Mr C needed to use an online delivery company, so that PayPal could check delivery 
and receipt of the item. 
As Mr C didnt agree with the investigators view, the complaints been passed to me to issue 
a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals Buyer Protection Programme is not an insurance cover but provides protection in 
certain circumstances to a buyer who has used PayPal to pay for goods directly or through a 
third party website. The terms covering this protection are found in the user agreement, 
something Mr C wouldve accepted when he first opened his PayPal account. These terms 
are also available via PayPals website.
The terms of the agreement covering Buyer Protection dont guarantee a refund and state 
the claim decision is at the discretion of PayPal. They also say that PayPal may require a 
buyer to provide documentary evidence to support any claim. But PayPal must act fairly in 
exercising its discretion and rights under the agreement.
When deciding the outcome of this complaint, Ive looked carefully at the terms and 
conditions PayPal have highlighted. I can see that one of the conditions states that Mr C 
needs to use a courier company with online tracking. This enables PayPal to clearly see 
when the item was posted and that it was received back by the seller. Mr C didnt do this, so 
I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly when it has declined the claim for this reason.
I understand Mr C has provided a written receipt for the delivery, but unfortunately this 
doesnt meet the criteria of whats required. 
Having looked at the information Mr C has supplied, I can see that he gave PayPal a number 
of emails that he says is between him and the seller. In one of these emails the seller has 
confirmed receipt of the television. PayPal have confirmed that they are unable to use this to 
assess the dispute, as the communication was made outside of its platform  and its unable 
to confirm the authenticity of the information. As PayPal have contacted the seller directly 
and they have confirmed they didnt receive the television back, PayPal have found this to 
be more reliable information. In these circumstances, I dont find PayPal have acted 
unreasonably when they have used the information they obtained to asses the claim.
Whilst I sympathise with the situation Mr C has found himself in, I cant say PayPal have 
acted unfairly or outside of its terms and conditions when it has declined Mr Cs claim.  
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
