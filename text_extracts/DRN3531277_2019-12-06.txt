K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs A have  complained about how Barclays Bank UK PLC handled their request  to 
move their existing mortgage to a new fixed rate.
background
Mr and Mrs A had a preferential rate which ran until 31 December 2018.  In October 2018 
they applied for a new fixed  rate to run from after the existing rate ended.  The mortgage offer 
dated 12 October 2018 gave an estimated contractual monthly  payment (CMP)  of 
£1,646.84.
On 2 January  2019 Mr and Mrs As mortgage  direct debit was paid at their previous, higher, 
CMP. That same day a revised payment notice (RPN) was sent which said their monthly 
payment going  forward would  be £1,650.06.
Mr and Mrs A contacted Barclays on 5 January to query  the higher payment made in 
January and the RPN. Barclays agreed  to refund the £158.10 overpayment and the refund 
went through on 8 January. A fresh RPN  was then issued, this time for £1,651.15.
Unhappy with this, Mr and Mrs A complained to Barclays. They also said it was unfair they 
had to pay the same £999 product fee as new customers would. Barclays  apologised for not 
giving a clear explanation  on 5 January and paid £100 compensation for that. But, other than 
that, it didnt uphold their complaint.
Our adjudicator said Barclays hadnt done  anything wrong,  other than not making  things as 
clear as it could, and felt the compensation offer was fair. Mr and Mrs A didnt agree and so 
the complaints has been  passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The £999  fee was paid for the fixed  rate product Mr and Mrs A chose. That fee is part of the 
price of the fixed rate product and has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of work (or 
admin) the lender  has to do to set up the mortgage. For that reason theres  no grounds for it 
to be refunded. Mr and Mrs A chose  to proceed with the mortgage  offer  and thus accepted 
the terms of that contract including the product  fee.
The product  Mr and Mrs A took is a fixed interest  rate, its not a fixed payment. So whilst the 
interest rate will remain fixed until 31 January 2029,  the payment can vary based on what  
happens with the mortgage account,  for example if an overpayment  or underpayment is 
made, or some other fees and/or charges  are added to the account. 
The estimated payment  quoted on the mortgage offer was £1,646.84 and the explanation of 
that says:
These payments  are based  on a balance at the 12 October 2018 of £289,841.56.  The 
actual payments you will make may vary slightly, as they will be based on the mortgage  
balance on the 01 November 2018  when  the new interest rate will be applied.
Ref: DRN35312772As Mr and Mrs As preferential rate didnt end until 31 December 2018 the new interest  rate 
couldnt be applied  on 1 November 2018  as the offer assumed (the mortgage starting on the 
1st of the following  month is a standard assumption  for regulated  mortgage  offers), so the 
figures quoted  would always vary slightly .
Unfortunately here a combination of factors led to what  happened,  but none of these was the 
fault of Barclays. 
The first was that Mr and Mrs A pay their mortgage on the 1st of the month, which  is the 
same date the product switch took effect. The direct  debit  collection process   which  is the 
method Mr and Mrs A use to pay their mortgage   actually  starts a few days before the 
payment is taken. This is why when you try to vary  or cancel  a direct  debit theres  a 
warning that if the payment is due to be collected  in the next few days then it may be too late 
for the change to take effect. 
This means  that whilst the payment was collected on 2 January (due to the bank holiday), it 
had actually been called for in December. And in December the mortgage was still on the 
higher rate, with the higher CMP, so the amount called for was that higher amount. Thats 
not to say the product  change didnt take effect from 1 January, it did. Its just the payment 
had already been requested in December at the higher amount, so this meant Mr and Mrs A 
overpaid their mortgage by the extra amount in January. Once the payment  was credited to 
the mortgage account on 2 January Barclays calculated the new payment going  forward  
which led to the RPN  of 2 January being  issued with a CMP of £1,650.06.
The second  issue  is that when Mr and Mrs A queried the higher January payment Barclays  
refunded the overpayment to them. When the refund of £158.10 was issued to Mr and Mrs A 
on 8 January, the mortgage balance increased  by the same amount as the overpayment  had 
been removed.  This led to the CMP being recalculated as the mortgage balance  was now 
higher, and a second RPN  was issued on 8 January with a CMP of £1,651.15. If the 
overpayment hadnt been refunded to Mr and Mrs A, the 2 January RPN  of £1,650.06 would 
have stood.
Mr and Mrs A have  questioned how the balance of their mortgage increased from 
£286,722.70 on the 2 January RPN to £286,997.68 on the 8 January RPN; an increase of 
£274.98. They say this means theyre  accruing interest at a rate of £45.83 per day, whereas 
they say this should be about £19.48 per day.
Thats very easy to answer.  Mr and Mrs A have forgotten to include the £158.10 
overpayment refund they received on 8 January  in their calculations, so the balance  of 
£286,722.20 from 2 January was increased  by £158.10 on 8 January (when the 
overpayment was taken  back off their mortgage), as well as by the daily interest. This makes  
the interest paid over the six days to be £116.88,  which is about the £19.48 a day 
Mr and Mrs A were  expecting.
Barclays has admitted it could have explained  things better  on 5 January; its apologised for 
that and paid £100 compensation. Its not our role to fine or punish a business and our 
awards arent punitive. All I can do is consider the impact of a businesss actions on the 
consumer. I also look at the awards  of compensation weve made  in other  similar cases. 
Having done so Im satisfied that the £100 compensation already paid by Barclays  is fair.
Ref: DRN35312773my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means well not be engaging  in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask 
Mr and Mrs A to accept or reject my decision before 6 January 2020.
