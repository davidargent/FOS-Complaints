The complaint
Mr and Mrs D complain that they werent able to access their online banking with National
Westminster Bank Plc for some time. They said that they spent several hours calling from
overseas trying to fix this.
  
What happened
Mr and Mrs D werent able to get online banking access. They said this problem started in
late September 2019, and persisted for some time. They complained about this, and about
the length of time that they had spent on calls to NatWest trying to sort this out.
NatWest sent an electronic copy of a complaint response letter to Mr D on 1 October 2019,
with a suggestion as to how the problem of accessing online banking could be resolved.
NatWest also said then that it would consider covering the cost of the calls Mr D had made
from overseas, trying to sort this out, if he sent an itemised phone bill through.
NatWest said it understood that there were some problems with activation codes around this
time, and it thought that may have contributed to the problem. And NatWest said Mr D had
then invalidated his mobile number in early October, which would prevent him from receiving
the activation codes he needed to sign in. As NatWest suggested in its email, Mr D had
reregistered for online banking on 22 October 2019.
Mr D said NatWest hadnt requested an itemised bill from him. And it had promised to call
him back but not done so. Mr D said he could no longer remember the total time on calls or
on hold, although he remembered that the last call was over 75 minutes before he was cut
off. Mr D wanted NatWest to compensate him on the basis of the information provided at the
start of his complaint, when he says NatWest told him he could expect compensation of 9p
per minute. Mr D said NatWest hadnt paid or offered anything.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that refunding Mr Ds
call costs was a fair way to sort this out, and NatWest had already offered to do that if Mr D
could send it evidence of his call costs.
Mr D sent evidence of the rate per minute he was charged for landline calls to NatWest, but
he said he could no longer provide evidence of the length of time he was on the phone. He
said it was over six and a half hours.
Our investigator said the call rate Mr D had shown us worked out at about £1.40 per minute,
which would mean a payment of just under £550 if NatWest was covering the cost of six and
a half hours of calls. She asked NatWest if it knew how long Mr Ds calls to it had been.
NatWest said it could see Mr D had made a number of calls, but it couldnt tell how long Mr
D had been on hold. And it wouldnt pay the call costs without proof.
Mr D said he couldnt now provide that proof. His phone company didnt offer records going
that far back.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold it 
in part. This is what I said then: 
Mr D says he spent a significant amount of time on the phone to NatWest, and he 
wants the money back for that. Hes also told us he can no longer provide proof of 
the length of these calls, because of the time that has passed. But NatWest has 
shown us an email it says it sent to Mr D dated 1 October 2019. That email said 
Please forward an itemised phone bill and I will consider the call costs made to the 
Bank. So it does look as if NatWest was clear from the outset that it would want to 
see evidence of the costs of Mr Ds calls, if it was going to reimburse those.
I think its reasonable for NatWest to ask for this. Ive seen the evidence NatWest 
holds for calls Mr D made, so it does look to me as if NatWest doesnt otherwise 
have any way to tell how long the calls Mr D made were. Although Mr D has 
evidenced that calls made via his phone provider have a high call cost, NatWest cant 
tell how long he was on hold for. And it did ask for this evidence at the time.
So I dont think that NatWest has to pay Mr D £1.40 per minute for six and a half 
hours of calls without evidence. If Mr D has since been able to obtain evidence of the 
duration of his calls, he can forward this in response to my provisional decision. 
Otherwise, I would propose an alternative solution.
Mr D says he was significantly inconvenienced by not being able to access this 
online account. And although NatWest says that he disabled his mobile number in 
early October, that doesnt explain why he started to experience problems in late 
September. I think its likely that Mr D was affected by the problems NatWest has 
reported with the issue of activation codes. And I think that NatWest should pay 
some compensation for that, particularly as Mr D may have been left out of pocket for 
calls he made trying to resolve this issue. I think NatWest should pay Mr D £100 in 
compensation now.
I know that Mr and Mrs D may be disappointed by this decision, but without evidence 
of the duration of the calls Mr D made, and their costs, I dont think that NatWest has 
to do more than that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NatWest didnt reply. Mr D sent a substantive reply.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind.
Mr D welcomed my provisional decision, but said he wanted to comment on it. 
Mr D started by stressing that hed never received any request from NatWest to produce an 
itemised phone bill. He said if hed got that message, hed have responded to it.NatWest has shown our service the response it sent to Mr D, by electronic message, on 1 
October 2019. That includes the following  
Please forward an itemised phone bill and Ill consider the call costs made to the 
Bank.
I dont know why Mr D didnt see this, but I am satisfied that NatWest made its position clear 
at this point. And I think it is reasonable to expect that if Mr D wanted to ask NatWest to pay 
for a number of calls which hes told us were very lengthy and also very expensive, he would 
retain his bill to show those costs.
Mr D said he did not invalidate his phone number. He said hed never done that, and he was 
surprised that NatWest had said this. He said hed discovered only in the past month that 
NatWest had added an extra character to his number, so it couldnt call him. Mr D said 
NatWest had apologised for this, and resolved the issue. 
When NatWest said that Mr D had invalidated his mobile number, its referring to part of the 
process of logging in to online banking. It says that on 3 October, Mr D pressed the wrong 
button during this process, and that meant that its system no longer recognised Mr Ds 
phone number. 
NatWest has sent us its internal records of Mr Ds attempts to log in to his online banking, 
and this supports what it says. So I do think that Mr D invalidated his mobile number, and 
this was part of the reason why he wasnt able to access online banking.
Mr D said that if NatWest can see that he made many calls, then surely it could also see the 
length of these calls? He wanted us to ask NatWest this, as a possible way of resolving this 
complaint. 
Id like to reassure Mr D that we have asked NatWest for the detail it holds on calls from him. 
Its told us what it can see on its systems, and importantly, it has also shown us this. It sent 
us screenshots of the internal systems that record details of the calls. Those do show how 
often he called, and they dont show call duration. 
NatWest has explained that it doesnt have any record of how long Mr D is on hold for. That 
fits with what I can see. And Mr D has told us he spent a considerable amount of time on 
hold. So unfortunately this doesnt provide an alternative way of helping to resolve this issue.
Mr D stressed again that hed never received any request to itemise his calls, but NatWest 
did suggest hed be paid 9p per minute as compensation. Mr D said that hed hoped for 
more compensation than I was suggesting. Hed hoped that compensation would have given 
greater consideration to his expenditures, frustrations and inconveniences, and that we 
would have put this to the bank on his behalf. He wanted me to reconsider.
Ive explained that we have no way of telling how long these calls lasted. Ive noted that 
NatWest has been clear that it would only consider a sizeable reimbursement of call charges 
if it had evidence of those charges. And Ive said that I do think its reasonable to ask Mr D to 
provide evidence to show what he paid. So I dont think that I am able to ask NatWest to 
refund the expenditure that Mr D would like. I have though, considered the frustrations and 
inconveniences that Mr D has experienced, with not being able to access online banking, 
and not being able to resolve the problem easily. I dont think that everything that has gone 
wrong here is NatWests fault. But I do think that some of this is NatWests fault, and thats 
why Ive asked it to pay Mr and Mrs D £100 in compensation. 
I realise that Mr and Mrs D were hoping for much more, so I understand that they will be 
disappointed by my decision. But Ive reconsidered this case in the light of their further representations, and I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally 
proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr and Mrs D £100 in 
compensation.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D and Mr D to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 August 2021.
