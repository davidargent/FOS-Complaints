The above  are not separate loan agreements but for ease  of reference, Ill refer to them  as 
loans one to eight. Miss S didnt repay loan eight. 
Miss S says that WageDay Advance continued to lend to her when she was in financial 
difficulty and couldnt afford to repay  the loans. She wants a refund of interest, plus interest 
on the refund.  She also wants WageDay Advance to remove adverse information  from her 
credit file.
Our adjudicator initially said that the checks WageDay Advance carried  out before  loans  one 
to three  were proportionate  and it appeared that Miss S could afford to repay those loans. 
She said that WageDay  Advance  didnt  carry out proportionate checks before loans four to 
eight. But the adjudicator  said that Miss S hadnt  given us the information  we needed to 
decide that proportionate checks  would have shown that the loans were unaffordable. 
Miss S provided some further  information  and our adjudicator  looked  at the matter again. 
The adjudicator said that if WageDay Advance had asked  Miss S about other  short-term  
borrowing before  loan four, it would have seen  that she couldnt  afford  to repay that loan. 
The further information Miss S provided didnt  alter the adjudicators  view about loans five to 
eight. The adjudicator set out what WageDay Advance should do to put things right in 
relation to loan four. 
WageDay Advance  agreed to compensate Miss S in relation to loan four and said that as 
theres a balance outstanding, it would deduct the amount due to Miss S from the balance 
she owes. Miss S said it wasnt sufficient to address only loan four and that shed tried again 
to get further bank  statements for the relevant  period. 
As there was no agreement between the parties, Miss Ss complaint was passed  to me.
Ref: DRN91851062my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend to Miss S, WageDay Advance  had to check  each time that she could  
afford to make  the repayments.  The checks it did had to be proportionate. Whats 
proportionate depends on things like the size of the loan repayments and the information  
WageDay Advance  had about Miss S. Theres no set list of the checks a lender should carry 
out. 
WageDay Advance  asked  Miss S about  her income  and expenditure each time she asked to 
borrow. I think that was proportionate  in the early  stages  of its lending relationship with 
Miss S. Based on what WageDay Advance knew about Miss S, it appeared that she could 
afford to repay the first three loans. I dont think  that WageDay Advance needed to do any 
more than it did at that stage.  
WageDay Advance  has agreed to the adjudicators  recommendation in relation to loan four, 
so I dont need to comment  on that loan further. 
I think that before loans  five to eight, WageDay  Advance should have done  more. Thats  
because, by then, Miss Ss dependency on this sort of borrowing was established. I think  
that at this stage,  WageDay Advance should have taken steps  to verify the information 
Miss S provided about her financial situation. I cant see that it did that. But thats  not the end 
of the matter, as I need to determine  whether  that made any difference here. 
As WageDay Advance doesnt appear to have carried out proportionate and sufficient  
checks before loans five to eight, I cant say for sure what  it wouldve found out had it done 
so. Miss S has provided bank statements that show her financial position for part of the 
relevant period. So Ive been  able to get a picture  of what her financial circumstances were 
like before loan six. Miss S has also provided  her credit file, which shows other short-term  
lending around  the time of loans five to eight. 
I accept that this isnt perfect,  as different checks show  different things. And just because 
something shows up in the information  Miss S has now provided doesnt mean that it 
wouldve shown up in any checks that WageDay Advance mightve carried  out. But the 
partial information Miss S has provided  is the best indication  I have  of what her financial 
circumstances were  at the relevant time. In the absence of anything  else,  I think its 
reasonable to rely on it.
Miss S had other borrowing at the time of loans  five to eight. But, based  on what  Ive seen, I 
dont think its clear  that proportionate  checks wouldve shown that Miss S couldnt afford to 
repay loans  five to eight.  So, Im not able to conclude that WageDay Advance shouldnt have 
given Miss S those  loans.  
WageDay Advance  should take the action its already agreed to take in relation to loan four. 
As loan eight remains outstanding, WageDay Advance may use the refund to reduce what  
Miss S owes.  
Ref: DRN91851063my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part and direct CURO TRANSATLANTIC LIMITED, trading as 
WageDay Advance:
1.To refund to Miss S all interest and charges  shes paid in relation to loan four and pay 
simple interest at the rate of 8% a year*,  from the date each sum was paid until the date 
of settlement; 
2.To use this refund to reduce whats outstanding in relation to loan eight; and 
3.To remove any negative information  about  loan four from Miss Ss credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CURO TRANSATLANTIC  LIMITED,  trading as 
WageDay Advance  to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss S a certificate showing 
how much  tax its taken off, if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 March 2019.
