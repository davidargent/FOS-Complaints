The complaint
Mr R complains that a car acquired with finance from Close Brothers Limited trading as 
Close Brothers Motor Finance wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in which I upheld Mr Rs complaint. In my 
provisional decision I explained why I thought there were electrical faults with the car at the 
point of supply. I invited Mr R and CBMF to let me have any further evidence or arguments 
they wanted to make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr R said he accepted my provisional decision. CMBF acknowledged receipt of my 
provisional decision but didnt say whether they agreed with it or not.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr R has indicated that he accepts my provisional decision. CMMF hasnt said anything at 
all. So, I see no reason to reach different conclusions to the ones I set out I my provisional 
decision.
Putting things right
CBMF must put things right by allowing Mr R to reject the car.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Close Brothers Limited must:
End the agreement with nothing further to pay
Refund the deposit together with 8% simple interest from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement
Reimburse Mr R £60 for the reasonable cost of diagnostic tests
Refund £1769.47 paid by Mr R to settle the agreement
Pay £200 compensation for distress and inconvenience
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2021.
