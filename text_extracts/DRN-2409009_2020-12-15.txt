The complaint
Ms D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt receive a transfer she 
sent from a bank in Jamaica.
 
What happened
On 15 November 2019 Ms D made a wire transfer for JMD 49,315.50 (around £270) from 
her account in Jamaica to her account with NatWest in the UK. Ms K has told us the funds 
were intended as a gift for a family member. 
The funds werent paid into Ms Ds NatWest account and she travelled to the nearest branch 
of her Jamaican bank. The funds were refunded to Ms Ds Jamaican bank account as the 
transfer didnt go through. 
Ms D complained and NatWest issued its final response on 4 December 2019. NatWest said 
it wasnt clear why Ms Ds payment wasnt received and paid her £38 to cover her costs and 
£30 for the inconvenience caused. Ms D referred her complaint to this service and it was 
passed to an investigator. NatWests complaint handler explained that the systems evidence 
showed the wire transfer had been sent with an incomplete account number which is why it 
didnt complete. Our investigator didnt ask NatWest to take any further action and Ms D 
asked to appeal. As a result, Ive been passed Ms Ds complaint it make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has forwarded the Wire Transfer receipt that shows the details completed when it 
was instructed. The target account is noted on the bottom of the receipt. Whilst the target 
account details are similar to Ms Ds account number with NatWest, there is a digit missing. 
The evidence shows that Ms Ds transfer didnt go through because the account number 
used in the instruction wasnt complete. 
As the account number wasnt complete, NatWest correctly rejected the transfer and sent it 
back to Ms Ds bank in Jamaica. I understand this caused Ms D to travel to her bank and 
that the funds were intended as a gift for a family member. But NatWest couldnt use 
incomplete account details to process the transfer so Im satisfied its decision to send the 
funds back was reasonable. I havent found anything that shows NatWest made an error that 
caused Ms Ds transfer to fail. 
In response to the investigator, Ms D asked why NatWest didnt notify her about the failed 
payment. But NatWest wouldnt be aware of the correct account that Ms Ds transfer should 
have credited as the instruction didnt contain a valid account number. Without a complete 
account number, there was no way for NatWest to trace the correct account so it couldnt 
contact Ms D about the payment. 
NatWest has paid Ms D a total of £68 to cover her costs and the inconvenience caused. As I 
havent found that NatWest has made an error or treated Ms D unfairly, Im not telling it to 
take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 January 2021.
