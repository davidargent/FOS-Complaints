K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs W say Lloyds Bank Plc (Lloyds) mis-sold them Platinum (twice) and Premier 
packaged bank  accounts. Theyve  used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to 
complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr and Mrs Ws complaint and didnt think Lloyds  had
mis-sold the accounts.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Mrs Ws complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Ws complaint. 
Id like to explain the reasons for my decision. I think Mr and Mrs W chose to take the 
accounts. They appear to have had identifiable needs for the main benefits  and they used 
some of them such as the mobile  phone insurance, breakdown cover (at the more 
comprehensive level on these more expensive accounts) and preferential  overdraft terms. 
So while Im open  to the possibility Mr and Mrs W shouldve been  provided with clearer  
information, overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mr and Mrs Ws 
decision to accept what, on the face of things, look to have been fair recommendations 
made by Lloyds on each occasion. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs W to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 April 2019.
