The complaint
Mr and Mrs R are bringing this complaint on behalf of their late son, M, against NewDay Ltd 
(NewDay). They believe NewDay acted irresponsibly in giving M a credit card and 
subsequent credit increase.
What happened
Mr R said that NewDay agreed a credit for M in April 2018 with an initial credit limit of £1200. 
NewDay then increased this credit limit to £2950 in July 2019. Mr R says NewDay should 
neither have agreed the credit card nor increased the credit limit as it would have known that 
M had a poor credit history which included a county court judgment in 2014.
NewDay said its initial checks revealed a low level of debt with no arrears or active debt 
management plans. A public record and defaults were recorded 42 and 16 months earlier. It 
said it offers second chance lending to those with low or poor credit scores but starts with 
low credit reviewing the account prior to any credit, increase. It felt the credit increase it 
applied, which M didnt have to accept, was appropriate given the management of his 
account. It also said, when it became aware of Ms death as a gesture of goodwill it reduced 
the overall debt by a total of £177.73 (the charges applied from November 2019 to January 
2020)
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He found that NewDay hadnt been 
irresponsible in giving M a credit card. And that although M had exceeded his credit limit four 
times this had been offset by then remaining within his credit limit, and by making substantial 
payments over and above the minimum payments due. He didnt feel he had enough reason 
to say the increase NewDay applied to the account was irresponsible.
NewDay accepted this view but Mr and Mrs R on behalf of Ms estate didnt.
Mr R said M had serious mental health problems with the continual chasing from debt 
agencies. He felt NewDays decision to give M credit added to Ms stress.
Our investigator considered these points but didnt change his view. Whilst he empathised 
with Mr and Mrs Rs comments, he felt NewDay had done enough to check Ms financial 
situation at the time of his credit application and he didnt find the lending was unaffordable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do appreciate the difficult and stressful situation Mr and Mrs R find themselves, in dealing 
with the estate of their late son M.
I know Mr R has made the point that other financial institutions, on Ms death wrote off his 
outstanding debts. I need to make it clear that in this decision I can only consider NewDays 
actions. Just because other organisations have written off outstanding debts doesnt mean 
that NewDay automatically must do so.
Mr R has told us several times that as M had debts that, on that basis alone, NewDay 
shouldnt have offered credit. However just because a consumer has had or has a history of 
debt doesnt automatically mean its wrong to offer credit. If that were the case, then no 
consumer would ever have a second chance.
NewDay has told us that it offers second chance lending to those with low or poor credit 
scores. This is based on a low and grow model where it initially offers low credit only 
increasing the limits when the account management supports that. This can help those with 
a poor credit history to improve their credit ratings
It has also pointed out it advised M of the credit increase giving him the opportunity to opt 
out of them. Whilst that may be the case that doesnt take away its obligations to lend 
responsibly
Before agreeing to an initial credit application and to a credit increase a business needs to 
ensure it does so in a responsible manner. There isnt a set requirement of what a business 
must do in every instance. But they are expected generally to carry out appropriate and 
proportionate borrower focused checks around the affordability of any lending, before 
providing it, and to ensure a borrower can afford to make and sustain the repayments, taking 
account of their financial situation
So, I need to consider in the case of both the initial application and the credit increase if 
NewDay met these obligations. Or if there were further checks it should have carried out to 
ascertain the suitability of the proposed increases including Ms ability to manage 
repayments.
In terms of the initial credit application from the information NewDay has given us M was a 
homeowner and employed with a salary of £32000. It carried out credit checks which 
showed he had no active debt management plans in place and no arrears. 
This search did reveal a county court judgement from 2014 and defaults of a total value of 
£5700 with the last default applied in 2016. As both the last default and county court 
judgement were some considerable time prior to Ms credit application I dont think it was 
unreasonable for NewDay to offer a credit card with an initial modest limit of £1200. This 
seems to be in line with its stated low and grow model
I appreciate Mr R has given us information of previous debts M had. But two of these dates 
to 2010 some considerable time before NewDay agreed the credit card. So, I dont think this 
is information, if available to NewDAy, would have reasonably led NewDay to conclude that 
the initial credit was either irresponsible or unaffordable.  
Mr R has shown M was paying back several loans at £20 per month. I am not persuaded 
that NewDay was aware of this since it told us its searches showed M had no active 
repayment plans in place. One of the repayment plans was dated 2013 which may explain 
why NewDay was unaware of it.
I have considered very carefully if it is information that should have led NewDay to conclude 
offering credit would impact on Ms financial situation, but I dont think that it would. The 
repayments were modest ones which given Ms income dont appear unaffordable at the time 
of his credit application to NewDay.
Taking all of the information I have into account and given the type of lender that NewDay is 
I think it undertook a reasonable credit assessment which I dont think gave it grounds to believe that its credit would have impacted on Ms financial situation. I dont believe it was 
irresponsible in offering the initial credit that it did.
In considering the increase NewDay applied to Ms account in July 2019 NewDay had, by 
this time, the additional information as to how M was managing his account. 
I think NewDay adopted a very cautious approach in increasing Ms credit limit.
In February 2019 Ms account was reviewed and as a result he was offered a credit increase 
to £2200 confirmed in a letter to him that day. However, that increase, as I understand it 
didnt go ahead, as in March 2019 NewDay identified that M had exceeded his credit limit 
over the previous four months although I have noted the excess was at a modest level of 
between £22-29. I am not sure why NewDay offered the credit increase in February 2019, 
but I think it acted correctly in not going ahead with this when it realised M had exceeded his 
credit limit as described above.
I understand M then himself asked for a credit increase in April 2019, but this was declined 
due to having previously exceeded his credit limit. Again, I cant fault NewDay for this 
decision.
In June 2019 NewDay did offer M a credit increase taking his limit to £2950 on the basis he 
had stayed within his credit limit since March 2019. And he hadnt made any late payments 
since his account was opened. NewDay confirmed this increase in a letter which I have seen 
to M. The letter did give M the chance to opt out of this increase if he wanted to do so.
I have seen Ms account statements myself. I can see from these M often made significant 
payments over and above the minimum amount due both before and after the credit 
increase. For example, in March 2019 he paid £500 when the minimum payment due was 
£23 and in August 2019 he paid £545 when the minimum payment due was £45.24. The 
payments he made above the minimum due varied from £300 to just under £1000. This 
indicates to me that M was managing his account and I dont believe there were grounds for 
NewDay to be concerned. So, I dont feel NewDays decision to offer a credit increase was 
irresponsible.
I appreciate Mr and Mrs R have referred to Ms vulnerability and they feel the stress of being 
pursued by debt management companies contributed to his early death. As far as I am 
aware NewDay wasnt pursuing M for any debts prior to his death. And I am not aware that 
M made NewDay aware he was struggling. 
We do expect businesses to respond positive and sympathetically when consumers are 
having financial or other problems. But its difficult to expect businesses to take any action 
when they are not aware of issues.
I do appreciate that it can be difficult for anyone to ask for help. But I dont believe, based on 
the information that it had, that NewDay acted irresponsibly in offering credit. And I think 
based on the account history the credit increase was not unreasonable particularly given the 
caution NewDay applied prior to offering the credit increase.
Having not found NewDay to have done anything wrong I cant reasonably ask it to write off 
the outstanding debt as Mr and Mrs R have requested. But I am pleased that NewDay, as a 
gesture of goodwill, reduced the debt by the charges it applied in November 2019 to January 
2020. That feels to me to have been an appropriate thing to do.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr R 
to accept or reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
