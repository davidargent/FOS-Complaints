In our most recent opinion of this case our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint about  loans  
5 onwards and thought these loans shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ref: DRN98574702the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Rs complaint about loans 1  4 should be upheld. Mr R
appears to have accepted these findings,  so as these loans are no longer in dispute, I
havent considered these  further. However, I have thought about all of Mr Rs loans when 
looking at his overall lending relationship with Sunny.
Sunny says it carried out an affordability  check before allowing Mr R to take out any of these
loans  which involved it requesting information  about Mr Rs income  and expenditure. But
by the time Mr R was applying for his fifth loan, I think Sunny shouldve  carried out a more
thorough and proportional check of his financial situation - including  a review  of the lending 
history so far. 
Had Sunny  have completed  a full check of Mr Rs financial position it wouldve realised that 
Mr R had taken out four loans in two months and that at the time of applying  for loan 5 Mr R 
still had loans 2- 4 outstanding.  So, at the time of applying of loan 5 Mr R owed over £800 to 
Sunny and was applying  for a further £150.  This evidence suggests Mr R was having 
problems managing his money  and may have had problems repaying  his loans in a 
sustainable manor. And so, a properly carried our affordability assessment was likely to lead 
a responsible lender to conclude that it was unlikely Mr R wouldve  been able to repay loan 5 
 or any subsequent loans. So, I dont think Sunny shouldve  lent Mr R loans 5, 6, and 7 on 
this basis. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN98574703Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised Mr R was not managing to 
repay his loans sustainably. Even though Mr R paid off his loans early, he took out a number  
of loans in quick  succession. In fact, by the time he was applying  for loan 8 he had already 
taken out seven loans in just five months. Mr Rs first loan was for £150, but loan 8 was for 
£400  so the amounts  borrowed werent  significantly  reducing either.  So,  I think at this 
point Sunny ought to have known that Mr R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.  And as he wasnt making any real 
inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny, so Mr R had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 5 - 27;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5, 6 and 7 from Mr Rs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  8 - 27 should be removed from 
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit
International Limited should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or
reject my decision  before 20 May 2020.
