K820x#14complaint
Mr I complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie,SCA took money out of his account  following 
a chargeback and didnt  provide him with any seller protection.
background
Mr I sold an item online  in October 2018. In March 2019 PayPal told him the buyer  of the 
item had lodged a complaint about the condition of the item.  He says the money from the 
sale was taken off him and that he was told he wasnt  covered by the seller protection 
provided by PayPal. Mr I says this has cost him about Â£100 and has caused him distress  
and worry and says PayPals actions are not legal or moral. He also says hes not received 
the item back.
PayPal says the buyer of the item raised  a chargeback with his credit  card provider on the 
basis the item bought was not as described. It says it defended the chargeback but was 
unsuccessful and so returned the money.  PayPal says seller protection didnt apply for a 
chargeback where  the finding  was significantly not as described and its account terms and 
conditions make that clear.
Mr I had brought his complaint to us but our investigator didnt uphold  it. The investigator  
said he appreciated Mr Is frustration but didnt think PayPal  acted  unfairly as the chargeback 
was out of its control. The investigator thought PayPals terms and conditions  explained what  
may happen in the event of a successful chargeback and that seller protection  didnt  apply 
where there  was a finding of goods being  significantly not as described.
Mr I doesnt accept that view and in summary say no-one reads  the small print of contracts  
and questions why someone can wait as long as the seller  did before raising his complaint. 
He says the outcome of his complaint should  be decided  on morals and that he paid PayPal 
to look after his money.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for similar  reasons. I realise Mr I will be disappointed by my 
decision and I appreciate how frustrated he must be to not have either the item he sold,  the 
money for it and the postage costs. But I dont think any of that was PayPals fault or 
responsibility.
The chargeback rules are not set by for example PayPal but by the card providers. I can see 
that the buyer raised a chargeback with his credit card provider and despite PayPal 
defending the claim   it was successful. I appreciate Mr Is frustration as he hasnt received 
the item back but I can see that PayPal included  that information when it defended the claim. 
And Im satisfied in those  circumstances  that PayPal  didnt find in the buyers  favour  it was 
the card provider and that PayPal couldnt have done any more  to help Mr I. So I dont think 
PayPal made a mistake  or acted unfairly by taking the money out of Mr Is account  and I 
dont think for the reasons I have explained that it had any choice in the matter.
I appreciate Mr I says that information  was contained in the small print of PayPals terms and 
conditions and that nobody reads the small print. I cant fairly hold PayPal responsible  for Mr 
I not reading those  terms and conditions but I think the main issue  is that PayPal isnt 
responsible for the chargeback rules or the outcome of the chargeback.
Ref: DRN02854582Im also satisfied that PayPal makes  clear that its seller  protection doesnt apply where there 
is a finding under the chargeback procedure that goods were  significantly not as described 
as in this case.  So again I dont think PayPal made a mistake or acted  unfairly by coming to 
that conclusion  where  the card provider made that finding.
Overall Im satisfied that PayPal has acted fairly here and has explained its position to Mr I. 
So I cant fairly order it to repay  Mr Is money or ask it to make a goodwill gesture as Mr I 
would like. I appreciate  Mr I says we should  deal fairly with the public but our role is to deal 
fairly with both sides to a complaint. And I think Mr Is complaint ought to be directed to the 
buyer whom appears to have raised the issue of the quality of the item bought  but then 
decided not to return it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
