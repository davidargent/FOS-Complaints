K821x#15complaint
Miss T complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to her 
irresponsibly.
background
I attach my provisional decision dated 10 April 2019, which forms part of this final decision  
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Miss Ts complaint  in part. I invited both parties to provide any further  
comments they may have  by 24 April 2019  before I reached a further decision.
Miss T has agreed  with my provisional decision and has nothing  further  to add. I have  not 
heard from Sunny. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
I am content  that Miss T has accepted my provisional decision. And as Sunny has not 
provided any further arguments,  I see no reason  to alter the conclusions  I reached in my 
provisional decision of 10 April 2019.
putting things right  what Sunny should  do
refund  all interest and charges Miss T paid on Loans 8 to 26 ;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 8 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 8 to 26 are to be removed from Miss Ts credit 
file
write off the balance  of Loan  26 after applying the payments Miss T has made  
towards it to date as if she had been paying down the capital balance. I direct this 
because it was included in the original  offer and so its likely Sunny is satisfied that 
this is the correct redress outcome for Miss T. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss T a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 10 April 2019,  I uphold 
Miss Ts complaint in part. 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, should put things  right for Miss T in 
the way I have set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss T to accept 
or reject my decision on or before 26 May 2019.

background
Using the information provided  by Sunny I have created a table summarising the loans approved  for 
Miss T. It appears at the end of this decision. 
Miss T is represented by a third party and it says on her behalf that Sunny did not carry  out sufficient  
affordability checks when she was applying  for loans. Miss T says that if Sunny had, it would not have 
lent to her and by continuing to lend to her she became reliant on Sunnys credit.
Sunny has explained that we conducted creditworthiness checks, we assessed  Miss Ts ability to 
afford the repayments which  would fall due under  the proposed  agreement  and we considered how 
she was managing other debts at that time.  Based upon these checks  it was considered  responsible 
to advance credit.
Each loan was an instalment loan which meant that the cost was spread  over several months, usually  
six. I can see that Miss T repaid most of the loans within the month of taking them  out, sometimes 
within days. Some  were repaid over a few months. And there seemed to be a period around 
December 2016 and January 2017 when Miss T had more than one of the loans  at the same time  
Loans 10, 11 and 12. 
 
One of our adjudicators  considered the complaint and he thought that the checks Sunny carried out 
for Loans 1 to 4 went far enough and it was likely that the information Sunny had indicated that Miss T 
had enough disposable income to meet the monthly repayments. 
For Loans  5, 6 and 7 our adjudicator thought that Sunny should have done more and from what he 
had seen then its likely Sunny would have concluded that Miss T did not have sufficient  disposable 
income to afford the respective  highest  monthly repayments.  
Our adjudicator thought that the pattern  of lending ought to have been considered  as well and that 
from Loan  8 Sunny should  have questioned whether continuing to offer further  short-term loans to 
Miss T was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
 
So our adjudicators opinion was that Sunny should put things  right for Loans 5 to 26 and he gave 
some specific  details about  how he thought it should do that.
Miss Ts representative acknowledged it and asked  about  the additional  interest Sunny was adding to 
Miss Ts account during  the complaint investigation. Our adjudicator explained that although  we prefer 
interest to be suspended  whilst investigations are ongoing at this service its not something we can 
instruct a business to do.
Sunny did not respond to the adjudicators  opinion at first. So Sunny was informed that the matter 
would be passed  to an ombudsman to decide the complaint. 
Miss T received a default  notice in relation to the outstanding  sum (about £293)  on the last loan, Loan 
26. 
After this Sunny replied and made an offer to Miss T to put things right in relation to Loans 11 to 26. It 
gave reasons: 
We recognise that the manner  in which  the customer  used our product(s) may have indicated they 
were not, when looking at their usage overall,  using  the credit  for short term borrowing  needs. At the 
point at which  their usage extended beyond 12 months, that is, from when they had been charged 
interest on their loans for 12 months  onwards,  it is possible that they may have started to become 
reliant on the credit.  As a result, from this point in time the lending to them  may not have been 
sustainable. 
Ref: DRN69757554We therefore agree  to partially  uphold their complaint from this time onwards.
Sunny made the offer to refund the interest and charges on Loans 11 to 26 (less tax) and remove 
these loans from her credit  file record. The calculations on 26 March 2019  came to a refund of about  
£873. Sunny also offered to write off the outstanding balance on Loan 26, this effectively  means  that 
the offer includes a principal write-off amounting to about £58.
Miss T rejected this offer and wished to have an ombudsman review  the complaint. So it has been 
passed to me for a decision.
In view of the offer from Sunny it is clear to me that Loans 11 to 26 are not disputed  and subject to 
some points about the redress details  (dealt with below) then I do not plan to review these further.  
Miss Ts response  to our adjudicators  opinion did not include a rejection of his opinion and from that it 
seems Miss T accepts that Loans 1 to 4 should not be upheld. So I do not plan to review these  either.
From this complaint history  it seems  that Loans 5 to 10 are unresolved and I will be looking at these 
within the context of the complete lending history. 
I asked Miss T for additional  information most of which has been sent to me. Miss Ts representative  
has asked that I proceed on the information I have now.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding Miss Ts case. 
Ive decided to uphold Miss Ts complaint in part and have  explained why below.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss T could repay  her loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Miss Ts income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early  stages of 
a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Miss Ts complaint. These questions  are:
1.did Sunny, each  time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself 
that Miss T would  be able to repay  in a sustainable  way? If not, would  those checks  have 
shown that Miss T would have been able to do so?
Ref: DRN697575552.taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Miss Ts indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
3.did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Miss Ts complaint.
Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss 
T would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have shown that Miss T 
would have been able to do so?
Loan 5
Miss T applied  for a £400 loan repayable over six instalments of about £117 each month. 
By this point in the lending relationship between Sunny and Miss T, I think that a full and 
comprehensive check ought to have been carried  out by Sunny before lending. I say this because  it 
would have been the fifth loan in four months and Sunny ought to have been aware that Miss T was 
coming back for additional credit often and make more  enquiries. 
That financial  review ought to have included  verifying Miss Ts income streams  and her expenditure, 
regular financial commitments and any outstanding loans  and other short-term  loans. I do not think 
that Sunny did these  checks and so I have used the information I have to reconstruct, so far as I am 
able, what Sunny likely would have seen if it had carried out the checks  I considered  to have been 
proportionate for Loan 5. 
I asked Miss T for additional  information most of which has been given to me through her 
representative. I note all the explanations from Miss T about matters in general including that she was 
self-employed and so tax would have been due at some point. I think  that its likely that the court order 
income of about £1,814 each month from her former husband was not subject to tax. I note that she 
was paying HMRC arrears.  
The income  from her own employment which I have seen on her bank statements for this period  
amounts to a large  figure   quite a lot more  than the sum she regularly received from her ex-husband. 
When I reviewed  several months of statements  around this time I have seen that these income 
streams were often from the same payees which I can only assume are regular  customers. I asked 
Miss T to clarify some  aspects but I was not given more information than that which I have gathered 
from the bank statements.  I have not seen Miss Ts personal credit file.  
I have calculated about a 25% tax deduction likely to represent some tax on that self-employed  
income which around this time comes to about £650 (approximate tax calculation). I have deducted 
that from what I understand were the self-employed income amounts. 
A comprehensive  list of expenditure  has given me a figure to use as the total expenditure  sums. 
These included TV licence and TV programme  provider  subscriptions, media  company payments, 
mobile phones, mortgage,  a large loan with one company  (lender  initial B), credit card repayments, 
utility bills, HMRC  debt repayments, leisure  club subscription and when they appear  transfers 
abroad which  Miss T has told me were the costs of running a French house. In addition it seems that 
Miss T spent about £700  a month on food and transport for her and one dependent at that time. For 
the month leading up to Loan  5 these amounted to about £2,880 which I subtracted from the income 
from her husband combined with the net income (approximate) from her other sources  (total of about  
£3,774). The net amount  was likely around £890 which I think  was the disposable income  around that 
time. 
Ref: DRN69757556As the loan instalment payments were about £117 at their highest under the agreement  for Loan 5 
then I think its likely  that if Sunny had carried  out the comprehensive  checks  I would  have expected it 
to have done  then it likely would have seen Miss T could  have afforded £117 each month. And even if 
her former husbands  income was subject to tax, the additional  deduction to represent that sum is not 
likely to alter the calculations for her likely net income  so much for it to make a difference.
So I am not planning to uphold Miss Ts complaint  for Loan 5. 
Loan 6 
Loan 6 was applied  for soon after Loan 5 was repaid early in January 2016. It was for the same 
amount - £400  and the highest scheduled  repayment  due under the instalment agreement  was 
around £117  a month for six months. 
Most of the income and outgoings I have mentioned above in relation  to Loan 5 are much  the same or 
similar for this period  of time leading to Loan 6. So I think that if Sunny  had carried  out the 
comprehensive checks I would have expected it to have done then it likely would have  seen Miss T 
could have afforded £117  each month. And even if her former husbands income  was subject to tax, 
the additional deduction to represent that sum is not likely  to alter the calculations  for her likely  net 
income so much for it to make a difference.
So I am not planning to uphold Miss Ts complaint  for Loan 6. 
Loan 7 
Loan 7 was for a lesser amount, applied for a couple of months after Loan 6 was repaid early. It was 
for £200 with the highest  scheduled instalments being agreed  at about £61. 
In the month leading up to Loan 7 being applied  for Miss Ts income was greater than the previous 
months and even though her outgoings appear to be higher, still I think  that if Sunny had carried out 
the comprehensive checks I would have expected it to have done then it likely  would have seen  
Miss T could have afforded £61 each month. I say this taking into account  the tax for her self-
employed income, the fact that she may have been taxed on her former husbands payment  and that 
there is an unexplained  large outgoing of £650 to payee ref C&H  W. 
So I am not planning to uphold Miss Ts complaint  about Loan 7.
 
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for Loans 8 to 26 because  I dont 
think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Miss Ts indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Loans 8 onwards
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at which Sunny 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided any further lending. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think  that this point was reached by Loan 8. 
I say this because the amounts Miss T was borrowing were usually the same at £400 and Sunny 
ought to have  realised that Miss T was continually  coming back for credit  and so may have had some 
underlying reason to be constantly seeking high-cost loans with Sunny. 
 
Ref: DRN69757557A similar financial picture for Miss T is revealed for the months leading  up to Loans  8 and 9 as the 
earlier ones outlined above, save that in April 2016 I can see that Miss T was borrowing  from another 
lender as well. She took a £399 loan from Lender W on 22 April 2016. So this likely would have  been 
payable in late May 2016  about the time the first instalment for Loan 8 would have been due. That 
would have made a difference to her finances and demonstrates  she was in deeper need.  
Appropriate and comprehensive checks for these loans would have revealed the other short-term 
loans with which Miss T had and the fact that she was repeatedly returning to Sunny for large loans  at 
high-cost credit charges.  And it is noticeable that Loan 10 was the loan where Miss T did repay 
across the full loan term of six months and stuck to the 6 instalment structure. In addition  Miss T took 
two other loans (Loans  11 and 12) while Loan 10 was open  still. So the pattern of her credit needs 
altered and it seems  that she was borrowing from other lenders and taking more than one loan from 
Sunny. 
This reveals a different aspect of the lending relationship and I think  that Sunny ought to have 
considered this as its likely  it may have revealed some  underlying  financial difficulty.   
I think  that Miss T lost out as Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from Loan 8 onwards because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Ts indebtedness  by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ts credit file 
and therefore her ability  to access  mainstream credit and so kept her in the market  for these 
high-cost loans.
Here, I repeat what Sunny  has said in relation to Miss Ts complaint:
 
At the point at which their usage  extended  beyond 12 months, that is, from when they had been 
charged interest on their loans  for 12 months  onwards,  it is possible that they may have started  to 
become reliant on the credit. As a result, from this point  in time the lending to them may not have 
been sustainable. 
I interpret the 12 month mark in Sunnys explanation to mean around late August 2016 for Miss T 
which places that time point  at the early part of Loan 10. And so using Sunnys own logic I think  that it 
could appropriately consider  that Miss T was becoming reliant on its loans by the second interest 
payment on Loan 10.  
But I think her reliance started earlier  at Loan 8 - so Im upholding Miss Ts complaint  about Loans 8 
to 26 because  the overall pattern of lending  increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise  harmful  and she lost out as a result. 
Sunny has already offered  to put things right in relation  to Loans 11 to 26, and as its offer included a 
small capital balance  write  off for Loan 26 then Id expect Sunny to follow through with that. I have 
included it in the putting things right section  for clarity. 
Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. I know that Miss T was concerned at the addition of 
interest and that she received updated statements from Sunny about the outstanding  account. She 
received notification of a default for Loan 26. 
But overall  Ive not seen anything here that leads  me to conclude Sunny acted particularly unfairly  or 
unreasonably towards Miss T in some other way. And with the offer made by it in relation to Loan 26 
and my provisional decision to uphold  the loans  including Loan 26 then her credit file will be corrected 
and I think that Miss T will consider that she has been appropriately compensated.
