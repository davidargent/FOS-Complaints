K822xcomplaint
Mr A complains about the handling of his credit card account by NewDay Ltd (NewDay).
background 
Mr A says hes had his account for a number  of years. In March or April 2018 he told 
NewDay he was in financial difficulty and was unable to make  the minimum payment.  He 
completed an income and expenditure summary  and it was agreed he would make  
payments of £1 per month with the situation  to be reviewed after six months,  but Mr A says 
this review didnt take place. 
Mr A also says he then received a default notice  and he spoke to NewDay as he didnt want 
a default to be put on his credit file. Hes told us he was reassured this wouldnt take place 
and he was told to disregard  the letter. But a default was put on his credit file in November 
2018 and NewDay  then sold his account  to a third party  business.
So, Mr A says he wants NewDay  to remove the default and accept repayment of the full 
balance of his account.
During our investigation NewDay  acknowledged  it could  have  dealt with Mr As phone calls 
better and it offered him £80 compensation for any distress or inconvenience hed been 
caused by this and its delay in responding to his complaint.
Our investigator thought NewDays offer of £80 compensation  for its service failures was 
reasonable, in the circumstances. He said NewDay had acted positively and sympathetically 
when Mr A made it aware  of the difficulties he was experiencing and it had set out exactly  
what action it would  take if he didnt bring his account up to date and how this might  affect  
him. The investigator also thought a further review of Mr As situation wouldnt have made 
any difference as hed told NewDay  his circumstances hadnt changed from the previous 
review. 
Mr A disagreed with the investigators conclusions.  He said during his last conversation with 
NewDay he was repeatedly told no default  was being registered on his credit file. And his 
circumstances at the time might not have changed, but NewDay  didnt even give him the 
chance of a call back or a letter to review his situation and to repay enough to avoid the 
default.  
So, the matter  has been referred to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to partly uphold Mr As complaint  and to require NewDay to pay him £80 
compensation. Ill explain why.
I see when Mr A contacted NewDay about  his financial difficulties, it conducted an analysis 
of his income and expenditure  and as a result it agreed  a nominal payment plan for six 
months from May to October 2018, with interest  and charges frozen. So, I think NewDay  
responded positively and sympathetically to his situation, as this service expects.
Ref: DRN00375772I also see Mr A missed  a payment in June 2018 and he made  the other payments later than 
agreed. So, NewDay sent him a letter asking him to bring his account up to date by the next 
payment date, failing  which his account would be terminated or he would be asked to pay 
the full balance and his account may be sold on. It sent him another  letter in August 2018  
saying his account had been  passed to debt collection and on 6 October 2018 it sent him a 
further letter saying  it would register a default on his credit file after 28 days. 
So, Im satisfied the correspondence  NewDay sent Mr A told him clearly and accurately what  
would take place and within what timescales if he didnt  bring  his account up to date. I also 
think it was reasonable  for NewDay to take the steps Ive outlined above and not to conduct 
a further review of Mr As situation given hed told it his circumstances  hadnt  changed since  
the previous review.  
I note during two phone calls with NewDay Mr A was wrongly told a default had already been 
registered against him, when this hadnt  in fact taken place at that stage and Ive listened to 
the call recordings.  I note during the call on 12 October 2018 the agent wrongly told Mr A a 
default would have already been  recorded  against him when he was 44 days  in arrears.   The  
agent then went  on to tell him the default letter dated 6 October was just a routine letter and 
he could file it away as it probably  just meant a default had already been  recorded against 
him. But the agent didnt tell Mr A a default  wouldnt be recorded against  him. So, whilst I 
dont doubt this is what Mr A recollects,  I cant uphold this aspect of his complaint,  based on 
the available  evidence.        
I see NewDay has now acknowledged  these calls could have been handled better and it has 
offered Mr A £80 compensation  for any distress and inconvenience he was caused by this 
and by its delay  in responding to his complaint.  I think this is reasonable and I dont think it 
would be fair for me to require NewDay  to pay Mr A anymore compensation, in the 
circumstances. 
my final decision
My final decision is I partly uphold this complaint and order  NewDay  Ltd to pay  £80 
compensation to Mr A.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 January 2020.
