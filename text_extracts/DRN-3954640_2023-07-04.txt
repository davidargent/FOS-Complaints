Page 1 of 4The complaint
Mr T complains that The Co-operative Bank plc, trading as Co-op Bank, wont refund to him 
the money that he paid for some holiday club membership points. Hes being represented in 
his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr T and his wife had some holiday club membership points and they entered into a 
purchase agreement to trade-in those points for some membership points in a different 
holiday club from the holiday company in February 2016. They also agreed to pay a net 
purchase price of £4,700 which Mr T paid using his Co-op Bank credit card in March 2016. 
Mr Ts representative made a claim to Co-op Bank under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 in February 2019. It said that the holiday product was mis-sold to Mr T and his wife 
by the holiday company and, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt 
have purchased it and it provided a witness statement from Mr T.
Co-op Bank said that for Mr T to have a valid claim under section 75 he must show that 
payment was made directly to the supplier (or an associate of the supplier) but his payment 
was made to another party, so he had no claim against it under section 75. It also said that 
theres a requirement to provide evidence to support the claim. Mr Ts representative said 
that the supplier and the other party were associates so Mr T did have a claim under section 
75. Mr T wasnt satisfied with Co-op Banks response so a complaint was made to this
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ts complaint should be upheld because he didnt 
think that Co-op Banks decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. He said 
that he hadnt seen any evidence to support Mr Ts claim that the membership was 
misrepresented so he wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of 
sale. He wasnt persuaded that the holiday company hadnt provided Mr T and his wife with 
something that they were contractually entitled to so he didnt think that it had breached the 
contract. As he didnt think that Co-op Banks decision to decline Mr Ts section 75 claim was 
unfair he said that he hadnt decided whether there was a debtor-creditor-supplier 
relationship.
Mr Ts representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
verbal misrepresentations were intentionally used by the sales representatives to
create the argument of relying on written versus verbal representations;
DRN-3954640Page 2 of 4Mr T is happy to provide a sworn statement to confirm the verbal representations
made to him at the time of sale;
the purchase agreement shows that their existing 65,000 points were traded but Mr T
and his wife continued to receive management fee demands from that holiday
company and had to engage its services to rescind the contract;
it has referred to a decision issued by this service in which it was found that the
consumers verbal submissions were credible;
the holiday company made verbal representations to Mr T and his wife at the point of
sale about the nature, extent and benefits of the holiday product and the material
characteristics of the product were misrepresented to them so they were induced to
make a transactional decision that they wouldnt normally have made based on those
misrepresentations; and
Mr T has advised that it was represented to him and his wife that by making the
purchase the holiday company would take over their existing holiday product and end
their liability but, when he engaged its services, they were still under the original
contract and the holiday company hadnt fulfilled the promise made to Mr T and his
wife.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ts complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
Mr T paid for the membership points in March 2016 using credit provided by Co-op
Bank and section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of
goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section
are met);
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ts claim under section 75 as only a court
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Co-op Banks response to
his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr T and his wife signed the purchase agreement in February 2016 and they also
initialled the notice of withdrawal form that they could use to withdraw from the
agreement within 14 days without giving any reason  I consider it to be more likely
than not that they would also have signed other documents at that time relating to
their purchase of membership points but Ive not been provided with any other
documents, including the schedules to the purchase agreement which are referred to
in the purchase agreement;
Mr T and his wife traded-in their 65,000 membership points in another holiday club
and agreed to pay £4,700 for 65,000 membership points in the holiday club  the
purchase agreement says: The Purchaser hereby trades in to the Vendor all rights in
his title indicated below, including responsibility for the management
charges/maintenance fees. In return the Purchaser receives [points in the holiday
company] for which he is liable to pay the points fees. The Purchaser further
understands that all Traded Accommodation is subject to verification of the points
value attributed to it and confirmation of title;
the holiday company had agreed to accept the traded-in points and to become
responsible for the management charges and maintenance fees  and Mr T says thatPage 3 of 4he and his wife were told that the holiday company would take over those points and 
that, after five years, they would be able to leave the system without any penalties  
but he says that it hasnt taken over those points and they wont get out of the 
membership after five years;
both Mr Ts representatives letter to Co-op Bank in February 2019 and Mr Ts
complaint form say: The timeshare product was mis-sold to our client by the broker.
But for the misrepresentations made to our clients, they would not have purchased
the timeshare product and there was no reference in either of those documents to a
claim for a breach of contract by the holiday company;
as the holiday company had agreed in the purchase agreement to accept the traded-
in points, I dont consider that Mr T and his wife were induced into entering into the
agreement by a misrepresentation about the traded-in points but Ive considered
whether or not theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company;
Mr Ts representative says that the holiday company was to take control of the
traded-in points but that didnt happen and Mr T and his wife continued to receive
management fee demands relating to those points so engaged Mr Ts representative
to rescind the contract;
any failure by the holiday company to accept the traded-in points and to become
responsible for the management charges and maintenance fees could be a breach of
contract by the holiday company but Ive not been provided with any evidence of the
management fee demands that Mr T and his wife have received or evidence to show
whether or not the contract for those points has been rescinded so Im not persuaded
that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the
holiday company but, if there was a breach of contract and those points have now
been rescinded, that may be an appropriate remedy for any breach of contract;
Mr T says in his witness statement that he and his wife were told that: the holiday
company would take over their existing points and, after five years, they would be
able to leave the system without any penalties; they would have guaranteed
availability for holidays by using an exchange programme (and they werent told that
they would need to pay for any additional fees); and they werent made aware of any
perpetuity clause in the agreement;
Mr Ts representative described in its February 2019 letter the misrepresentations
that it said had been made to Mr T by the holiday company which were based on
what Mr T had said in his witness statement;
the purchase agreement says: The Vendor agrees to sell and the Purchaser agrees
to buy Points in [the holiday club] upon and subject to the terms and conditions
stated on this document and in the attached schedules  so Mr T and his wife had
agreed to buy the points and theres no reference in the documents that Ive seen
which says that Mr T and his wife would be able to leave the club after five years
without any penalties;
if Mr T and his wife had been told that they would be able to leave the club after five
years without any penalties, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect that to
have been confirmed in writing  and, if that was an important consideration for Mr T
and his wife, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked the
holiday company to confirm it in writing;
the purchase agreement refers to an existing exchange membership programme and
says that the documentation is available in English (as well as other languages) but
Ive not been provided with any documents relating to the exchange programme and
Ive seen no evidence to support Mr Ts claim that he and his wife were told that they
would have guaranteed availability for holidays by using the exchange programme orPage 4 of 4that they werent told that they would need to pay additional fees  I dont consider it 
to be likely that the holiday company would have said that Mr T and his wife would 
have guaranteed availability;
the purchase agreement says: Fees received in connection to the associate
membership of [the exchange programme] will be reverted to this organisation; and
Im not persuaded that its likely that Mr T and his wife were told that they wouldnt
have to pay any additional fees for using the exchange programme;
Ive not been provided with all of the documents relating to the points, Ive not seen
what Mr T refers to as a perpetuity clause and I havent seen any provisions relating
to the agreement ending  but Im not persuaded that the holiday company not
making Mr T and his wife aware of any perpetuity clause in the agreement would be
a misrepresentation for which Co-op Bank would be liable under section 75;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points
were misrepresented to Mr T and his wife by the holiday company or that they were
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations 
nor am I persuaded that the membership points were sold to Mr T and his wife in
February 2016 in a way that would cause Co-op Bank to have any liability to Mr T
under section 75;
as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation, I consider that theres no
need for me to make any finding as to whether there was the relevant relationship
between the debtor, the creditor and the supplier in these arrangements thats
required for a claim under section 75;
although I sympathise with Mr T and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their
holiday club membership, Im not persuaded that Co-op Banks response to their
section 75 was unfair or unreasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require
Co-op Bank to refund to Mr T any of the money that he paid for the membership
points, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2023.
