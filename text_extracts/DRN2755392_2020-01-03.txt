K820x#14complaint
Mr R has complained that Aviva Insurance Limited has been  charging him too much for a 
mortgage payment  protection insurance (PPI) policy.
background
Mr R originally took out the policy in 1999. Over time the cost of the monthly premiums 
steadily increased  before being reduced  in 2018.
Our adjudicators view was that Aviva hadnt  been overcharging for the policy. Mr R 
disagrees with the adjudicators opinion and so the case has been  passed to me for a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr R originally took out the policy in 1999, at which  time it cost £5.10  per £100 of cover.  In 
2009 the cost went  up to £8.88 per £100.  But Aviva hadnt given consumers the correct  
notice of the change and therefore in May 2010  it rectified this by returning the rate back 
down to £5.10 per £100. In September 2010 the rate was increased to £7.91.  From  that 
point the rate was gradually increased so that by 2017 it was £8.43 per £100 of cover. 
However, in June 2018 the rate was then reduced to £5.06  per £100 of cover.  It appears to 
have been this substantial reduction which has caused Mr R to think  that hes been 
overpaying for the policy previously.
The PPI policy is not individually  underwritten, meaning that everyone who had that policy 
was paying the same rate per £100 worth  of cover. I havent seen any evidence that there 
was an error  in the amount Aviva  charged Mr R, which is to say that he was paying  the same  
as Aviva was charging everybody else who held the policy.
Ive seen evidence  that, from at least  2012,  Aviva was sending  Mr R annual  reviews that 
included a breakdown of the cost. Mr R himself agrees that he was aware  of the what  he 
was paying for the policy.
As well as highlighting the cost, the annual reviews  that Mr R was sent included statements 
saying that cheaper  or more appropriate cover may be available from other  providers and 
explained that policyholders could compare policies using the Money Advice Services 
comparison tables. Mr R could have cancelled the policy at any time if he had found  the cost 
unacceptable.
I can understand why Mr R would think that if Aviva was able to drop the rate down  to £5.06 
per £100  of cover in 2018, then he must have been  paying too much for it previously. 
However, Avivas pricing policy would  have been  based on a number of factors and it is not 
for this service to comment on Avivas  commercial pricing strategy. My decision has been 
limited to looking at whether there  were  any errors  in the way that Aviva applied  its pricing 
decisions to Mr Rs policy and I have found  that there were not.
