The complaint
Mr and Mrs C are unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) handled their 
request to close their accounts and send funds to their overseas account.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C moved overseas. In October 2019, they wrote to NatWest and asked it to 
close both of their accounts and send the funds to their account overseas. NatWest closed 
Mr Cs accounts on 12 December 2019. It wrote to Mr and Mrs C in February 2020 asking 
them to contact it, so it could confirm some details with them before it transferred the funds. 
It didnt hear from them, so it wrote to Mr and Mrs C in April 2020 explaining it hadnt heard 
from them and its transfer attempt had been rejected due to invalid beneficiary account 
details. It asked Mr and Mrs C to submit a new request with new beneficiary details. NatWest 
also apologised and explained its letter dated February 2020 had been sent to Mr Cs 
previous address. It sent him a cheque for the account balances in July 2020.
Throughout early 2020, Mr C says he contacted NatWest a number of times to find out why 
the funds hadnt been sent to him. He says he was told each time the funds would be sent to 
him, but they werent.
In May 2020, Mr C appointed a representative  who Ill refer to as Mr M  to help him 
retrieve the funds from NatWest. In June 2020, Mr M wrote to NatWest asking it to look into 
why Mr C hadnt received his funds.
In December 2020, NatWest looked into Mr Cs complaint and explained it sent the 
combined total of both accounts to Mr Cs account abroad in December 2019. It explained 
that the transfer was rejected by Mr Cs overseas bank account provider, due to invalid 
beneficiary details. It says it accepted whilst it didnt receive responses to its letters from 
Mr C, he did contact it on a number of occasions. It apologised and sent Mr C a cheque for 
£100. It also explained Mr C would need to evidence his call costs and any professional fees 
hed incurred. 
Mr C was unhappy with the amount NatWest had offered as compensation and sent it a 
summary totalling £900, to represent the costs and professional fees he had incurred. He 
also referred his complaint to our service and said he wanted NatWest to send the funds to 
his account overseas. He said he wanted to be compensated as his family had suffered from 
financial loss, distress and anxiety. And he said he wanted Mr Ms professional fees paid.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and said whilst he agreed NatWest caused some 
delays, the £100 it had offered was fair in the circumstances. Mr M disagreed and said he 
didnt think NatWest had done enough to follow up the return of Mr and Mrs Cs funds. And 
he said he didnt think it didnt respond to him about the complaint. He said this caused all 
the anxiety, stress, delay and other related unpleasantness Mr and Mrs C suffered.
As Mr and Mrs C disagree, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this case, theres no dispute by either party that the funds were initially returned to 
NatWest by the overseas account provider, because Mr and Mrs C had provided invalid 
account details. So Ive only considered whether NatWest did enough after this and whether 
the amount they offered Mr and Mrs C to put things right is enough. Having done so, I think it 
is. Ive explained why below.
Ive looked at NatWests internal notes. On 20 February 2020, the funds for Mr and Mrs Cs 
accounts were returned to NatWest by their overseas account provider. NatWest wrote to 
Mr and Mrs C the same day, asking them to contact it. But it wrote to Mr and Mrs Cs 
previous address. Mr C then contacted NatWest on 9 April 2020 asking for an update, so 
NatWest wrote to him on 20 April 2020. It asked him to provide new beneficiary account 
details so it could send him the funds from his account. It sent this letter to Mr and Mrs Cs 
correct address. It requested this information again on 27 May 2020, as it hadnt heard from 
Mr and Mrs C. It didnt hear from Mr and Mrs C, so sent them a cheque for the account 
balances on 1 July 2020.
I think NatWest attempted to obtain the correct account details to enable it to send the funds 
to Mr and Mrs C promptly. It chased Mr and Mrs C for these details on two further occasions 
when it hadnt heard from them. So I think it did enough to notify Mr and Mrs C their payment 
had been returned and to obtain the correct overseas account details that were required. But 
it did make an error, which it has accepted, when it sent the letter dated 20 February 2020 to 
Mr and Mrs Cs previous address. This caused a delay until Mr C contacted it. I agree it 
should have sent the letter to the correct address.
However, Ive thought about what would have happened if NatWest had sent the letter to 
Mr and Mrs Cs correct address in February 2020. And having done so, I dont think this is 
likely to have made an impact. This is because there is only record of Mr C contacting 
NatWest once in April 2020, since the request to close the account was made in 
November 2019. I appreciate Mr C says said he made numerous calls to NatWest, but I 
havent seen any information to suggest this. So I dont require it to do anything further here.
Professional costs
Ive considered whether it was necessary for Mr and Mrs C to have appointed Mr M and 
incurred professional fees in order to bring their complaint. Having done so, I dont consider 
it was.
I say this because Mr C was able to speak to NatWest in April 2020. And NatWest wrote to 
Mr and Mrs C in April and May 2020 to obtain the correct details for their overseas account. 
It also explained what information it needed to send the funds to them. Mr and Mrs C wrote 
to NatWest on 10 June 2020 providing the same account details they had previously 
provided. But I cant see that this letter was received by NatWest, until Mr M wrote to it on 
23 June 2020, enclosing a copy of the letter dated 10 June 2020.
In any event, on 1 July 2020, NatWest issued a cheque to Mr and Mrs C. So I dont consider 
it was necessary for Mr and Mrs C to appoint Mr M to represent them, as NatWest had made 
attempts to put things right and had spoken to Mr C to communicate what he needed to do, 
before Mr M was appointed. And had Mr and Mrs C provided the correct beneficiary details 
to NatWest when it requested these, the professional costs wouldnt have been incurred. So 
I dont think NatWest should pay Mr Ms costs.I appreciate Mr M didnt receive a response to his letter dated 23 June 2020 until he 
complained. I think NatWest should have responded to Mr M, acknowledging his letter, given 
that it had the required authority from Mr and Mrs C for Mr M to represent them. NatWest 
has accepted it should have done this and has apologised. 
Whilst NatWest sent Mr and Mrs C the account balances by cheque on 1 July 2020, it wasnt 
presented for payment by Mr and Mrs C. Since the complaint has been referred to our 
service, new overseas account details were provided by Mr M in May 2021. NatWest 
attempted to transfer the funds, but this payment was also rejected. So it reissued a cheque 
in June 2021 and Mr M confirmed receipt of it. I appreciate Mr M facilitated the cheque being 
paid to Mr and Mrs C. However, Mr and Mrs C would have also been able to provide the 
correct overseas account details to NatWest directly, without Mr Ms involvement. So I dont 
think NatWest need to pay Mr Ms professional fees.
Overall, I accept NatWest made an error when it incorrectly wrote to Mr and Mrs Cs 
previous address and that it should have acknowledged Mr Ms letter. However, I think 
NatWests offer to pay Mr and Mrs C £100 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay £100 to settle the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr and Mrs C £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C and Mr C to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 September 2021.
