The complaint
Mr M complains that he was given misleading information by NewDay Ltd.
What happened
Mr M says NewDay agreed a six-month payment plan with him and said he needed to make
a payment by 25 July 2019. He says he did so and made the required six payments but
NewDay told him he couldnt continue to use the account and that it made a mistake as the
payment needed to be made before 25 July 2019. Mr M says he paid £300 for nothing and
his credit report has suffered due to the default that NewDay unfairly registered. He would
like the default removed and interest refunded.
NewDay accepts it made a mistake by giving the incorrect date and has paid £40
compensation. It says Mr Ms account was in arrears from May 2019 and after the
agreement ended, Mr M didnt make required payments. NewDay says the default was
correctly registered and it sold the account in June 2020.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint. The investigator
thought NewDay made a mistake and misled Mr M. And also thought it unfair of NewDay to
assume what would have happened if the correct information had been given. The
investigator recommended NewDay pay a further £150 compensation and remove the
default from Mr Ms credit file.
NewDay doesnt accept that view and said the position would be different if Mr M repaid the
balance.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision and said as follows. 
I said I didnt uphold this complaint and said there was no question here that Mr Ms account 
was in arrears in July 2019 and that he had been told the account may default. I also thought 
there no question that NewDay agreed a six-month repayment plan with Mr M and told him 
the first payment needed to be made by 16.00 on 25 July 2019. I accepted Mr M made that 
payment and the required payments. So, I appreciated his frustration in those circumstances 
in finding out the account wouldnt be reopened and that he couldnt use it.
I was satisfied NewDay should pay compensation for that mistake which I can see it has. But
the key part of this complaint is the registering of a default. I was satisfied that having told Mr 
M it was agreeing a repayment plan that NewDay acted unfairly by closing the account and 
by registering a default when it did. I said I find that NewDay made a mistake and it misled 
Mr M.
I said I had to fairly consider what took place when Mr M found out about the mistake. I was
satisfied having looked at the account statements that Mr M owed NewDay well over £700
but that no payments were made from December 2019 to June 2020. So, I thought on 
balance that in those circumstances NewDay would have been entitled to have registered a 
default in early 2020 in any event. I appreciated Mr M says he paid NewDay £300 for 
nothing, but Im satisfied that he owed NewDay the money and that a default couldnt be 
avoided here.
I accepted the default should fairly have been registered in early 2020 but I also accepted 
that to ask NewDay to amend it wouldnt be in Mr Ms best interests. I also accepted that if 
Mr M had repaid his debt or agreed a new repayment plan then I would have ordered the 
default be removed. But I couldnt see any evidence of such agreement or any attempt by Mr 
M to repay any of the debt.
Overall my provisional view was that NewDay made a mistake, but I didnt require it to 
remove the default from Mr Ms credit file. I also thought the compensation NewDay had paid 
is fair and reasonable and that I couldnt see any evidence of a financial loss by Mr M as a 
result of what took place.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and in summary says he wasnt paid the £40 and says he 
didnt make any further payments as the debt was with a third- party company. He says it 
wasnt his fault what took place.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view that I reached in my provisional 
decision and for the same reasons. I make clear to Mr M that NewDay credited his account 
with the £40. I also think that Mr M was obliged to repay his debt regardless if the debt was 
sold and that a default couldnt be avoided here as he didnt repay that debt.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2021.
