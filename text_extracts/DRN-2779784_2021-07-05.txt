The complaint
Miss H complains that PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Using information Mr Lender has given us, here is a brief table of the approved loans. The 
spaces show significant breaks in the lending relationship which I will address in the main 
part of my decision.

One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and referred to the significant gaps. These 
made a difference to his two assessments as the loan table shows that Ms H had three 
different sets of lending periods with Mr Lender. He did think that by loans 7 and 8 that 
Mr Lender ought to have been carrying out more checks to verify certain elements of 
Miss Hs finances.  As Miss H has not sent to us any details of her financial circumstances at 
the time, then he was not able to review it. So, he did not uphold her complaint for any of the 
loans but invited Miss H to send to us additional information such as bank statements and a 
personal credit file so that we could see what her financial situation was like for the lending 
periods. 
Miss H disagreed with our adjudicators opinion. The invitation to Miss H to send in more 
details and/or records has been repeated several times and the latest being 30 June 2021. 
However, nothing has been received from Miss H. 
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable 
for the consumer. These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr Lender was required to establish whether Miss H could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the regulatory bodies overseeing consumer lending  the Office of Fair Trading 
and later the Financial Conduct Authority Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) - defined 
sustainable as being the ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be 
able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and 
without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that. I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information 
provided in this context and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint.The breaks in the lending periods
Miss H was not indebted to Mr Lender for significant lengths of time on two occasions and 
these are important parts of the overall lending relationship picture. It means that we think its 
reasonable for a lender, like Mr Lender, to approach loan applications from a customer 
where theres been a large gap as if he or she were a new customer. And with Miss H these 
gaps between loans 2 and 3 and then again between loans 8 and 9 do lead me to think that 
when Miss H applied for loans 3 and 9 it was appropriate and proportionate for Mr Lender to 
treat her applications as if she were a new customer. And so, we would have expected less 
detailed checks to have been carried out for the earlier loans in each of the new loan chains.  
Loan chain 1
As a new customer, applying for relatively modest sums in 2014, I would not have expected 
Mr Lender to have done more than it did. And without more from Miss H I have decided not 
to uphold her complaint for loans 1 and 2.
Loan chain 2
My decision is the same as for loans 1 and 2 for the first few loans in this second loan chain. 
By loan 7, which would have been the fifth loan in that loan chain, then Mr Lender ought to 
have done more. Miss H was applying for a larger loan - £1,000  and to be repaid over a 
longer period. The first of the six repayments was a relatively high one, at around £430. So, 
I would have expected Mr Lender to have carried out a full financial review to verify that her 
income was at the level she had declared (very different to most of the earlier income figures 
Miss H had given them), and why it was she was returning for the fifth loan and for four times 
the amount of the previous loan. 
I dont think that Mr Lender did this. But I am not able to see what Mr Lender would have 
found out for two reasons  one is that Mr Lenders credit agency research results are too 
brief and so I do not really know what it saw. And the second is because Miss H has not sent 
to us anything further to demonstrate what a full financial review would have revealed. The 
same reasons apply to loan 8. And for these reasons I am not able to uphold Miss Hs 
complaint for loans 7 and 8. So I do not uphold Miss Hs complaint for any of the loans in this 
second loan chain.
Loan chain 3
Around 18 months had passed between repaying loan 8 and Miss H returning to Mr Lender 
to apply for loan 9. Loans 9 and 10 were for relatively modest amounts to be repaid over a 
relatively short time. And so, I think that Mr Lender need not have done more than it did 
before it approved the loans. 
By loan 11, which was for £500 over a 12 month repayment period, I think Mr Lender ought 
to have carried out additional checks. But as I have explained earlier, Miss H has not sent to 
us anything further to demonstrate what additional checks carried out likley would have 
revealed.  
My decision is that I do not uphold Miss Hs complaint for  any of the loans in the third loan 
chain. My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Miss Hs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 August 2021.
