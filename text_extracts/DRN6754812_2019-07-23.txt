K820x#14complaint
Mrs D complains on behalf  of her mother that payments made to NewDay Ltd were returned. 
Shes also unhappy about the level of customer service shes  received and wants  NewDay 
to explain why it kept returning her payments yet making demands for payment at the same 
time.
background
Mrs D set up a standing  order to make payments on her mothers credit account  with 
NewDay. She says that NewDay initially accepted payment but in October 2018 it began  
returning payments.
Mrs D contacted NewDay to query  the returned payments and was told someone would get 
back to her. This didnt happen.  Mrs Ds mother then began  to receive calls and letters  about  
missed payments. 
Mrs D complained to NewDay. In its final response it said Mrs D had missed  her last three 
payments. It advised her to check that she had the correct details in place for the standing 
order. It also suggested that Mrs D considered  alternative methods for making payments.
Mrs D wasnt happy with the response. She said the standing order was set up a while ago 
but it was only recently that payments had been  returned. She felt she had tried to resolve  
the issue with NewDay but hadnt received  the promised call back. 
Our investigator upheld  the complaint in part and said that NewDay  wasnt  responsible  for 
the incorrect reference on the standing  order but that it couldve done more  to investigate  
why the payments were being returned, which wouldve resolved the issue sooner. The 
investigator recommended that NewDay remove the marker  on Mrs Ds mothers  credit  file.
NewDay didnt agree that it should  remove the marker. It said it has told Mrs D there was a 
problem with the reference.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that initially the standing order has the correct  reference and that the first payment 
was successful. After that, payments were  returned.
Mrs D contacted NewDay about the returned payments. Ive listened  to some of the call 
recordings and its apparent that the call handler  at NewDay couldnt  see a problem with the 
reference and said that he would look into it and contact  Mrs D with an explanation.
Mrs D says she didnt receive a call back with an explanation as promised.  I havent  been 
provided with any information  to suggest that Mrs D was contacted  with an explanation. I can 
see that NewDay wrote to Mrs D to advise her of the arrears on the account  but this letter  
didnt contain  any explanation as to why the payments were being returned.
In the circumstances I think it was reasonable for Mrs D to wait for NewDay to contact her 
once it had discovered what the problem was. I dont think  it was reasonable for NewDay  to 
Ref: DRN67548122write to Mrs D about missed payments, or to place a marker on her mothers  credit  file, whilst 
the matter was being investigated. 
NewDay has said that it wrote to Mrs D and told her that the problem was with the reference 
number. Ive looked at this letter but I dont think it clarifies what  the problem  was. It just says 
theres a problem with the reference.
Its clear that NewDay felt it was up to Mrs D to identify what  the problem was and resolve it. 
Its also clear  that Mrs D thought NewDay was investigating  what  the problem was. On 
balance, and even  though  NewDay told Mrs D there was a problem with the reference, I 
dont think NewDay did enough to investigate the exact nature  of the problem and let Mrs D 
know how she could resolve it. Im satisfied that NewDay had access  to sufficient information 
that it could have identified the exact  problem, jus as the investigator for this service was 
able to. Had NewDay carried out a proper investigation, it couldve have resolved this much 
sooner with Mrs D.
In the circumstances, and whilst NewDay isnt responsible for the incorrect  reference, I think 
NewDay couldve done more to investigate and resolve the problem sooner with Mrs D. An 
earlier resolution of the problem  would  have led to payments being resumed sooner, which  
may have  meant that it was unnecessary to register a marker.
Because of this, I dont think its fair that a marker was placed  on Mrs Ds mothers credit  file. 
NewDay Ltd should remove the marker.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  the complaint. NewDay Ltd should  remove the 
marker.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 August 2019.
