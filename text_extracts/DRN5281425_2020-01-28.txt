Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Es complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as they thought  the pattern of borrowing  indicated     
Miss E was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but agreed to uphold from loan 9 
onwards instead.  Miss E declined  Sunnys offer so, the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss E could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN52814252the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss E could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Es complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 3. Miss E 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I won be making  further  findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Miss E and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Miss Es fourth loan in just over two 
weeks, I think Sunny should  have  been  looking to build a clearer  picture  about  Miss Es 
finances before lending  her this loan. 
I think the fact Miss E repaid her loans much  earlier  than planned  should  have caused some 
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone was 
facing problems managing their money  and needing to refinance  loans on a regular basis.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss E, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Miss Es case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss E was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss E had taken out six loans  within  three weeks.  So Sunny 
Ref: DRN52814253ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss E was having  to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Es indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Miss Es first loan was for £100  and loan 6 was for £300.  At  this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Miss E was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in 
her income but to meet an ongoing need.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss E was provided with a new loan within  days of taking out 
the previous one. 
Miss E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 13 was 
taken out five months after Miss Es first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss E had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss E lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Es indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss E borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Es ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
The outstanding balance  due on Miss Es loan has been transferred to a third party. Sunny 
should buy the loan back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loan back than it needs to work  
with the third party to make sure the following  is achieved: 
refund  all interest and charges Miss E paid on loans 4 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework any outstanding loans  applying all payments  made by Miss E as if they went  
towards the principal  amount borrowed.  But importantly, Sunny needs to make sure 
that it collects no more than the principal sum lent. 
If and when the amount Miss E has paid exceeds the amount she was lent, any 
further amounts  paid should be treated as overpayments. Any overpayments that 
may have been made should  be refunded to Miss E with 8% simple  interest from the 
date the overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
if there is still an outstanding balance, any refunds  should  be used to repay any 
balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If there  is any surplus this should be 
repaid to Miss E.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Miss Es credit  file in relation to loans 4 
and 5. 
Ref: DRN52814254the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 13 should be removed from 
Miss Es credit file. You do not have to remove any outstanding loans from Miss Es 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss E 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing the above Miss E still has an outstanding balance due on loan 6 then it should 
try and work  together  to come to a mutually  agreeable  repayment  plan in order to repay 
what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Miss E fairly. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Es complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 February  2020.
