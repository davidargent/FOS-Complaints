The complaint
Mr W complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA closed his account, and prevented him
from accessing his credit facilities. Hed like it reopened and compensation for the impact.
What happened
Mr W had an account with PayPal.
On 20 April 2020 PayPal limited Mr Ws access to his account, and they asked him for proof
of his identity. Mr W provided a copy of his driving licence to PayPal. However, they thought
this showed Mr W was under 18 at the time the account was created  and therefore
permanently limited it.
Mr W wasnt happy with PayPals actions. He explained that he had access to PayPal credit
and a promotional credit of £10 which he now couldnt access.
PayPal thought theyd acted fairly so Mr W brought his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ws complaint. They thought that PayPal acted fairly
when closing his account. But, they thought that PayPal should provide Mr W with a credit
account.
Neither party agreed with our investigators view. In response Mr W said:
What happened to his credit limit of £3,100 and the £10 credit on his account?
His account was opened on in July 2009, which was after he was 18 years old 
PayPal advised that Mr W can apply to open another PayPal account and reapply for 
the credit facilities. But, they cant guarantee hell be approved.
As neither party agreed with our investigators assessment the case was passed to me for a 
decision. 
On picking up Mr Ws case I reached a slightly different conclusion to our investigator. I 
agreed that PayPal acted fairly in closing his account  but I didnt agree that PayPal should 
provide Mr W with a credit account. 
I asked Mr W and PayPal to reply by 22 September 2022. Neither party responded, so Ive 
reconsidered my conclusion below. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I said:
The terms of Mr Ws user agreement state that any account can be limited with immediate
notice if theres a breach of the agreement including providing false, misleading or
inaccurate information. PayPal explained on signing the agreement Mr W agreed to the
following declaration:
If you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old
Ive looked at the evidence provided by PayPal  and the information Mr Ws obtained from
PayPal about his account opening. Im understand this will disappoint Mr W, but looking at
the evidence provided Im satisfied his account was opened in March 2009  which was prior
to him turning 18. It follows, I think Mr W breached the user agreement on joining PayPal,
and they acted fairly in choosing to immediately terminate his account.
Mr Ws also complained that he lost access to PayPal credit of £3,100. PayPal have
explained that credit is only available if a customer has an active account, and therefore
Mr Ws credit facilities were removed at the same time the account was closed. PayPal also
explained that any promotional credits  including Mr Ws £10  wont be available to him
after the closure of the account. It follows, for the reasons Ive outlined above, I cant say
PayPal acted unfairly in removing his credit facilities or not providing him the £10
promotional credit.
I appreciate this will be disappointing to Mr W, however for the reasons Ive outlined above
Im not currently thinking of asking PayPal to do anything further here.
As I previously explained neither Mr W or PayPal responded to my provisional decision. And 
I therefore see no reason to change the outcome I reached previously. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2022.
