Our adjudicator felt that the complaint should be upheld in part. She said:
 Sunny had already upheld Miss Cs complaint  about loan1 and offered to put things right 
by making a payment to her in line with what this service wouldve recommended. So our 
adjudicator said she didnt need to consider  this loan as part of her assessment 
 she thought that Sunny hadnt done  anything wrong in providing loans 2 through  to 5 
 but she did think that Sunny had been wrong to give loans 6 to 22 to Miss C as, by that 
stage, the overall  pattern of her borrowing history suggested that shed become persistently 
Ref: DRN88421832reliant on short term loans. As a consequence  she felt that Sunny shouldve  recognised  that 
further lending  to Miss C was unsustainable 
 to put things right our adjudicator recommended  that Sunny  should refund all interest and 
charges Miss C had paid on loans from 18 August 2015 until 8 April 2018 (loans 6-22)  plus 
interest on the refunds, and amend her credit  file to remove all information about  these  
loans.
Sunny disagreed. It mainly said that Miss Cs loan repayments were  deemed to be 
affordable and sustainable  based  upon the income  and expenditure information she 
provided. And as well, it took into account the cost of any additional credit commitments.  
Sunny also said that there were sometimes gaps of several months between Miss C settling 
a loan and taking out a new one - and that some of the loans were  paid off early. Overall,  
Sunny didnt agree it was responsible for causing  Miss C any financial detriment.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny has offered to provide a refund of interest  paid by Miss C on loan 1, plus interest on 
the refund.  It says the loan was repaid on time and this information was reported to credit  
reference agencies   so theres no adverse data that needs  to be removed from her credit 
file. It doesnt appear that Miss C paid any charges on that loan for which a refund would 
also be required. So, Ill include this loan later in my decision  when I say what Sunny  is 
required to do to put things right, but I dont need  to say any more about it. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN88421833I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss C, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised:
Miss C was not managing to repay her loans sustainably. Miss C had taken out 
6 loans within a little over a year.  
A couple of those  loans were overlapping. 
There was one gap of 2 months after paying off loan 4 before taking  out loan 5. But 
before this gap Miss C had been  borrowing continuously for about  10 months. So it 
wasnt reasonable of Sunny to think her situation  had improved and she was now 
asking to borrow because of a new need  for a short term loan rather than an ongoing  
problem.
Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Miss C was borrowing 
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Shed  first asked  for £350 and when she asked for her sixth loan she hadnt repaid 
loan 5. Agreeing  loan 6 meant Miss C was yet again indebted to Sunny for an 
amount of £350.
Miss C wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. By loan 6 she 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.  
I think that Miss C lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN88421834the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss C borrowed were likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Cs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ive taken into account that there  were no significant breaks  in lending until Miss C 
took out a loan in August 2017  (loan 20), having paid off loan 19 some 7 months 
earlier. And Ive thought about  whether this break in lending meant that Miss C was 
effectively starting  over and the gap in borrowing meant shed  had time to put her 
finances in order  so she wasnt any longer dependent on high cost short term loans. 
But looking at the amount loaned,  I think that it was unfair  for Sunny to effectively 
continue to lend without making  further more detailed enquiries to find out more 
about Miss Cs circumstances at the time.  She first came to borrow £350 and now, 
three years later was still asking  for this amount. I dont think this pause between  
loans was long enough for the lender to think her situation had improved and she no 
longer had an ongoing issue  but rather a new emergency she needed money  for.
Loan 20 was for £350  whilst loan 1 was an open ended credit account  with a limit 
of £350, loan 20 matched the largest  principal amount  she had ever borrowed before 
(looking at loans  2-22, only loans  7& 11 previously were  for as much as £350). 
I think Sunny shouldve been  concerned that Miss Cs borrowing continued to be 
unsustainable. And this is borne  out by what followed as Miss Cs next loan was also 
for £350  shed  never before borrowed this much from Sunny for 2 months in a row. 
And loan 22 was for £200  which was also quite a significant amount for Miss C to 
borrow given that half the loans she took out were  for less than this.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-22 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If it hasnt  already done so, refund all interest  and charges Miss C paid on loan 1 and 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded  interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on loans 6-22 and pay interest of 8% 
simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges  from the date they were paid (if 
they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6-22 should be removed from 
Miss Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN88421835my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Miss C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2019.
