The complaint
Mrs G complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs Gs representative says that Mrs G entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance in September 2009 to pay for a holiday ownership product. The 
loan was repaid in March 2010. Mrs Gs representative says that Mrs Gs husband entered 
into loan agreements with Barclays Partner Finance in September 2011 and September 
2015 to pay for other holiday ownership products and her representative says that the total 
amount paid for the products by Mrs G and her husband was Â£87,850.
Mrs Gs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act in February 2021. Barclays Partner Finance said that 
Mrs Gs claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 as her purchase was made in 
September 2008 and she settled the loan in March 2010. Mrs Gs representative made 
further claims to Barclays Partner Finance and a complaint was then made to this service. 
Mrs Gs complaint form says that: the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to Mrs G; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mrs Gs ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured her into entering the 
agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure her; and the 
membership was misrepresented to her; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to 
section 140A  and it said that the claim should also be considered under section 75. The 
complaint form also said the holiday company was in liquidation so was in breach of 
contract.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Gs complaint should be upheld. She said that 
this service had received very limited information on this matter and doesnt have a copy of 
the letter of claim that was sent to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021, the purchase 
documents or anything from the point of sale. She thought that it was likely that Mrs Gs 
section 140A claim was late under the Limitation Act and that Barclays Partner Finance was 
entitled to rely on the timing of Mrs Gs misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that 
the holiday company had gone into liquidation in January 2020 but Mrs Gs representative 
had sent information suggesting that Mrs G didnt have a membership at that time so she 
didnt think that there had been a breach of contract. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs G.
Mrs G disagreed with our investigators recommendations and has asked for her complaint 
to be considered by an ombudsman. Her representative has responded in detail and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
although the loans in September 2011 and September 2015 were made to Mrs Gs 
husband, its clear that they were for their joint benefit;
the holiday ownership product was marketed as an investment but theres no 
functioning re-sale market for it;
the products were essentially perpetual long-term contracts;
no affordability assessment was carried out;
Mrs G was subjected to aggressive sales practices and pressured into the 
agreements;
the holiday company went into liquidation in January 2020 so is in breach of contract;
although Mrs Gs loan was discharged in March 2010, the unfairness in the 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance continued;
the limitation period doesnt begin to run until the facts relating to that unfair 
relationship could have been discovered with reasonable diligence and section 32 
postpones the limitation period;
the product was misrepresented to Mrs G and there was an unfair relationship 
between her and Barclays Partner Finance; and 
there were multiple breaches of accepted good practice, guidance and statutory duty.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Gs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Ive not been provided with copies of any of the contractual documents that would 
have been entered into by Mrs G but it seems to be clear that a loan was made by 
Barclays Partner Finance for her to pay for a holiday ownership product  Barclays 
Partner Finance says that the loan was made to Mrs G in September 2008 but 
Mrs Gs representative says that the loan was made to her in September 2009 and 
the only documentary evidence from that time that Ive seen is a sales docket that is 
dated September 2009;
Mrs Gs representative has also referred to loans that were made to Mrs Gs husband 
in September 2011 and September 2015  but those loans were made to Mrs Gs 
husband and not to Mrs G so Mrs G isnt an eligible complainant to complain about 
those loans and Im unable to consider a complaint about those loans in this 
decision;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Gs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Ive not seen Mrs Gs representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in February 
2021 but it seems clear from Barclays Partner Finances response to that letter and 
from Mrs Gs complaint form that claims were made under sections 75 and 140A;Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Gs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the holiday ownership product was misrepresented to her 
and that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to her;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in January 2020 and 
Mrs Gs representative says that Mrs G didnt own a membership of the club in 2019 
 so, when the holiday company stopped trading, Mrs G no longer had a membership 
so I dont consider that the liquidation of the holiday company is a breach of contract 
for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable to Mrs G under section 75 - and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract by the holiday company prior to Mrs G ceasing to be a member of 
the holiday club;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs G could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her into buying 
the holiday ownership product when she bought it in September 2008 or 2009 as that 
was the latest time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss 
would have been incurred as that was when her she also entered into the loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but Mrs Gs claims werent made to Barclays 
Partner Finance until her representatives letter in February 2021, more than eleven 
years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I 
consider that her misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
Mrs Gs representative says that the limitation period doesnt begin to run until the 
facts relating to the unfair relationship could have been discovered with reasonable 
diligence  but when she had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for 
the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs 
Gs claims;
Mrs Gs representative says section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the limitation 
period - section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action 
has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin 
until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence 
have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to 
deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that Mrs G has provided enough evidence to show that theres 
been a deliberate concealment of any facts from her and I dont consider that section 
32 is applicable in these circumstances; 
Mrs Gs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs G and 
Barclays Partner Finance and that the unfairness in the relationship with Barclays 
Partner Finance continued after the loan was discharged;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan was settled in March 2010 and Mrs Gs 
representative says that the loan was discharged in March 2010 so Mrs G would 
have had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until February 2021, more than 
ten years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I 
consider that her claim under section 140A is now also time-barred; 
our investigator also considered Mrs Gs complaint that the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan but she said that she 
hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for 
Mrs G;
the loan was made to Mrs G in September 2008 or 2009 and was repaid in March 
2010 and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs G asked Barclays Partner Finance 
for any information about the affordability assessment that it conducted before her 
representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021  more than ten 
years after the loan had been repaid;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mrs G to have raised any concerns 
about the affordability of the loan or the affordability assessment that was conducted  
before then and Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for 
Mrs G when it was made to her;
Barclays Partner Finance issued its response to Mrs Gs claims in February 2021 
and it said that her claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act  I consider that 
its response was fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mrs G for the issues that her representative has described but I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the money that she paid under the 
loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response 
to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2023.
