The complaint
Mr Y complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made a series of errors on
his accounts.
What happened
Mr Y had two personal loans from NatWest, each for £3,000 and taken out in April 2019 
and July 2019. He fell into arrears in September 2019. In April 2020, NatWest agreed to a 
payment deferral on the loan payments until September 2020, with payments to resume in 
October 2020. But  payments started again in September 2020, due to an error. In 
December 2020, Mr Y was still in financial difficulty and NatWest agreed to defer payments 
again, with a monthly payment of £1 being made by Mr Y, with zero interest. But the full 
loan payments came out of Mr Ys current account again that month. Interest of £259.21 
was charged. In March 2021, NatWest agreed to send Mr Y an income & expenditure form 
to see if he qualified for an extension to the financial hardship plan; but nothing was 
received.
Mr Y complained. He said there had been a series of errors by NatWest, which had caused 
he and his wife acute distress and worry. Each time, he had to call NatWest to sort things 
out  which took a lot of his time and only added to his distress. And  he went into 
unauthorised overdraft on his current account. He said NatWest should pay compensation 
of £6,000.
NatWest apologised each time. In October 2020, they refunded the loan payment of 
£226.67 to Mr Ys current account  as it shouldnt have been made because of the 
payment deferral arrangement. But they later noticed that the direct debit for £226.67 
hadnt been paid from Mr Ys current account  so they said the £226.67 was effectively a 
compensation payment. Mr Y said hed been caused expenses of £85  but NatWest 
declined to pay that.
In December 2020, NatWest said the financial hardship plan hadnt been set up properly  
and loan payments of £350 were taken. These were reversed and NatWest also refunded
the interest of £259.21 which had been charged in error. They paid compensation of £50.
In June 2021, NatWest apologised that the paperwork hadnt been sent to Mr Y for an 
extension to the deferral plan  but this was because theyd decided he didnt qualify for that 
due to the arrears outstanding on his loans. NatWest agreed that Mr Y shouldve been told 
that in the first place  when he first asked about the extension. NatWest waived arrears 
interest of £169.54, and paid compensation of £150.
Mr Y brought his complaint to us. Our investigator considered that NatWest had dealt with 
Mr Ys complaints reasonably. Theyd put things right  in terms of adjusting the loan 
payments and refunded interest where necessary. She said NatWest had paid total 
compensation of £426.67. And NatWest had agreed to offer a further £100 to Mr Y  
which he declined to accept. Overall, she felt that the total compensation was acceptable 
for what had happened.
Mr Y asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
I then considered Mr Ys complaint and issued a provisional decision which said:
As part of Mr Ys original complaint, he also brought to us a complaint about the setting up 
of a payment holiday in April 2020  which led to markers on his credit file and his loans 
falling overdue. But this complaint was considered by our investigator to be out of time  as 
Mr Y didnt bring his complaint to us within six months of NatWests final response in July 
2020.
Mr Y accepted this  and so to be clear, this provisional decision deals with the other 
aspects of Mr Ys complaint.
Its clear to me that NatWest made a number of errors over a long period of time on Mr 
Ys loan accounts. I can see how frustrating that must have been. Mr Y has argued 
strongly about the effects that NatWests errors had on himself and his wife. In 
considering the effects on his wife  our rules say that as Mr Y is the complainant here, I 
cant consider those in my decision. But Ive read Mr Ys testimony about the effects on 
both he and his wife, and I sympathise with their situation.
Ive seen what happened on each of the three parts of Mr Ys complaint. And each time, 
to be fair to NatWest, they sought to put things right. In October 2020 they refunded the 
loan payment of £226.67  which was taken in error. NatWest have said that because the 
actual loan payment of that amount wasnt made - as the payment was returned unpaid  
then the amount of £226.67 should be considered as compensation for what happened. I 
dont think thats a reasonable stance to take  as Mr Y will have to make that payment to 
his loan account eventually  as the money is still owed. So, Ive taken that into account 
when considering my provisional decision.
In December 2020, NatWest reversed the loan payments and refunded interest of £259.21 
charged in error, and paid compensation of £50.
In June 2021, NatWest apologised and waived interest of £169.54 and paid compensation 
of £150. Since then, NatWest have offered a further amount of compensation of £100  
which Mr Y has rejected.
And so  My Ys complaint comes down to whether he should be paid more compensation 
by NatWest. Ive considered this. I discount the amount of £226.67 as being a compensation 
payment  as I dont think it can be seen that way. So - NatWest have paid total 
compensation of £200 and have offered a further £100. Our service has set down criteria for 
how much compensation should be paid when considering complaints. This is available on 
our website. We say that an award of over £300 and up to around £750 might be fair where 
the impact of a businesss mistake has caused considerable distress, upset and worry  
and/or significant inconvenience and disruption that needs a lot of extra effort to sort out.
Typically, the impact lasts over many weeks or months. I consider that Mr Ys experience 
falls into this category.
Mr Y has argued very persuasively about the effects of NatWests errors  hes described 
the effects on his mental and physical well-being. I also bear in mind also that there were 
three sets of problems, and they took place over several months. And I can see that 
cumulatively, they did cause Mr Y considerable worry and stress and had a real impact on 
his life. And so - I think NatWest should be prepared to increase the total compensation
payment to £400  so making a further payment of £200 to Mr Y.
Responses to the provisional decision:NatWest had no further comments, but Mr Y did. He said that the impact on himself and 
his wife should be reconsidered. He argued that his wifes illness was brought on by 
NatWests errors, and this in turn, affected him (as the complainant and account holder).
I now need to consider Mr Ys points and make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about what Mr Y has said and considered his complaint again. Theres no doubt 
that NatWest did make a series of errors, and I accept that the stress and worry for Mr Y and 
his wife was significant. But  these are points that Mr Y made in his original complaint to us, 
and through the course of our investigation. And so -  as the provisional decision set out, I 
had considered this. 
Ive thought about everything again, and Im confident that the compensation that I proposed 
is the right amount for what happened, and in line with the guidelines that our service 
follows. And therefore  while I know Mr Y will be disappointed - I am not going to vary from 
the provisional decision.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc must:
Pay compensation of £200 to Mr Y for distress and inconvenience. This is in addition 
to the payments of £200 already made.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2022.
