K822xcomplaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one open  ended credit facility and eighteen  high-cost  short  term 
credit instalment loans  that Sunny provided  to Mr P from April 2014 onwards. Mr Ps last 
loan was provided in May 2017.  Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ps complaint and thought he 
shouldnt have been provided with any further  credit from 7 August 2014 onwards.  Sunny 
disagreed with our adjudicators assessment. So the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mr P was unlikely  to have been  able to make his payments in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it advanced further  funds on the open-ended  credit facility  on 
7 August 2014.  
I say this because  by this stage, it ought to have  been  apparent to Sunny  that Mr Ps use of 
his open-ended facility  suggested that there was no reasonable  prospect of him clearing the 
Ref: DRN04397812balance, in the way set out in the schedule provided, or even within  a reasonable period of 
time. 
Sunny then transitioned Mr P from a facility which its own product literature said shouldnt be 
used for an extended  period of time to a series of instalment  loans which had the same 
effect. Mr P then exhibited  a borrowing pattern  of taking  out further loans not too long after 
repaying previous  ones  some of which were provided when Mr P already owed money.  
Sunny continued  lending  to Mr P even when  this pattern was repeated and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised  that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for him. Mr P had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt  
have provided  him with. So I think that he lost out and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on all credit  from 7 August 2014 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans provided means that any information recorded  about the 
instalment loans on Mr Ps credit  file is likely to be adverse. So all reference to these 
loans should be removed from Mr Ps credit  file;
if after all adjustments have been  made outstanding balances  remain on loans 13, 
16,17 and 18 these can be deducted  from the compensation Sunny now needs to 
pay Mr P.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr P compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2020.
