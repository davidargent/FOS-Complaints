The complaint
Mr H says Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat, lent to him 
irresponsibly. He says he had spiralling debts when he took the loans from MoneyBoat. 
These debts were causing him problems both with his finances and his mental health. He 
thinks that MoneyBoat shouldve seen this and not lent to him. 
What happened
This complaint is about two instalment loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr H in 2019.

Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. He thought that MoneyBoat had information that 
showed that all of the loans were unlikely to be affordable for Mr H. 
MoneyBoat disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that, whilst the credit reference 
agency information did show Mr H had other lending, it wouldnt be practical to fully review 
all of the information it had before approving these loans. This was partly due to its 
automated processes, and partly as it said its consumers wanted a quick decision about 
lending.
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
As our adjudicator explained, MoneyBoats credit checks showed that Mr H had significant 
amounts of other debt when he took these loans with MoneyBoat. The repayments to 
these would meant that Mr H wouldnt have been able to repay the MoneyBoat loans 
sustainabley. This was becuase his existing expenditre and repayments looked to exceed  
his income, so he would need to borrow further to make these repayments. 
MoneyBoat has said that it didnt fully consider the information it had about Mr H before 
lending. This was to ensure that it provided a quick and efficient service to Mr H. And it 
also says that the industry regulators guidance does not say that it needed to look at each 
line of a credit file in respect of each loan, particularly early on in the lending relationship.
But MoneyBoat had information that showed Mr H was possibly in financial difficulty. And 
having looked at the credit file information MoneyBoat has supplied I dont think its difficult 
to see this. The first few pages of the credit file information MoneyBoat has supplied show 
that Mr H had significant amounts of other lending. There is more detail about this later in 
the report.
I think its reasonable to say that this information was easily accessible to MoneyBoat. And 
it follows that its also reasonable to say that MoneyBoat should have fully considered it.
So, I think MoneyBoat couldve realised at that time that Mr H may have some longer-term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. And I think MoneyBoat shouldve seen Mr H wasnt likely to have been able repay 
the loans in a sustainable way.
So, I think that MoneyBoat shouldnt have given loans 1 and 2 to Mr H and I think hes lost 
out as a result of this and Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about these loans.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress MoneyBoat should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not lent to Mr H, as Im satisfied it shouldnt have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr H may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, he may have 
looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr H in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr H would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce MoneyBoats liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
MoneyBoat shouldnt have given Mr H loans 1 and 2.
If MoneyBoat has sold any outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat is not able to buy the debts back then 
MoneyBoat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) MoneyBoat should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything it has already refunded.
B) MoneyBoat should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr 
H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr H originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr H as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr H having made 
overpayments then MoneyBoat should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat should then refund the amounts calculated in A 
and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr H. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr H. MoneyBoat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal MoneyBoat has already written-
off.
E) MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in 
relation to loans 1 and 2. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to deduct tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
should give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax MoneyBoat has deducted, if they ask 
for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Evergreen Finance London Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2021.
