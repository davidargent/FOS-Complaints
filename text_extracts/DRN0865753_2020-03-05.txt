*At times,  Mr H had loans outstanding when he made a new application, this figure  represents the 
highest combined  monthly repayment due now a new application has been made. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought  the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed and made  an offer from loans  nine onwards. But as this was not in line with 
our approach and Mr H didnt accept  the offer, the complaint was passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN08657532But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, by the time he took out loan 4, Mr H already had 3 outstanding  
loans with Sunny.  He was also taking out loans in quick succession. 
This shouldve alerted  Sunny to the possibility that he may have been having  problems 
managing his money and realised that it was unlikely Mr H would be able to be able to 
sustainably repay  this and any subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by. I 
say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay their loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out 6 loans within 6 months  and Mr H had been indebted to 
Sunny for the entire time.  So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not 
Mr H was having  to borrow  further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN08657533Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 12 was taken 
out 15 months after Mr Hs first  and although  the amounts of the loans differed, Mr Hs 
repayments remained roughly the same throughout as he had multiple loans running at 
the same time. Mr H had also paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect,  service  a debt 
to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
6 onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  the length  of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had 
negative implications  on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him/her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and five and 6 to 12 and Sunny  should 
put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans four and five from Mr Hs credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries  about loans  6 to 12 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2020.
