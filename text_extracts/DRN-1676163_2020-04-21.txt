The complaint
Mrs W complains that Lloyds Bank PLC can't trace an account she has a passbook for 
that says she had £416.04 in 1988. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I won't repeat them again 
here. Instead, I'll focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Passbook accounts could be used without the physical book being present in branch. 
Whilst Mrs W has a passbook in her possession that shows she had £416.04 in 
1988, the funds could have been withdrawn and the account closed without it being 
updated. 
Lloyds searched its records and found two other accounts for Mrs W - the last one 
closed in July 2000. As Lloyds hasn't found any record of an open account it's likely 
her passbook account was closed and the funds withdrawn before that point. 
Businesses aren't required to retain information, like account statements, indefinitely. 
I wouldn't expect Lloyds to have retained details of account movements going back 
to 1988.
On balance, I'm satisfied the information I've seen shows Lloyds doesn't have an 
open savings account for Mrs W. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2020.
