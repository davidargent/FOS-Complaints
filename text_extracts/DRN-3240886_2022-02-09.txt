The complaint
Mrs C complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
RCI Financial Services Limited, trading as Nissan Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality. Her 
husband is also involved with her complaint.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs C under a hire purchase agreement with Nissan Finance that 
she signed in March 2018. Mrs C complained about issues with the car the following day and 
continued to have issues with it. Mrs C says that the dealer arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert in September 2019 and the car was exchanged for a 
new car with a 20% discount in September 2020. 
Mrs C says that she was offered compensation by the manufacturers UK representative and 
she expected to receive compensation totalling £7,121 which included refunds of £6,123 for 
30 monthly payments under the agreement, £500 for GAP insurance, £249 for a service plan 
and £249 for tyre/alloy insurance. She didnt receive that compensation so she complained 
to Nissan Finance in May 2021. 
It said that the hire purchase agreement had been settled in September 2020 and that the 
manufacturers UK representative had confirmed that Mrs C had received a 20% discount on 
a different brand-new car but was prepared to also offer a £600 dealership voucher. It said 
that it fully appreciated the inconvenience and poor level of service that Mrs C had received 
but was unable to support the refund requested. Mrs C wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that if 
Mrs C wasnt happy with the arrangement that had been put in place for her to buy a new car 
she could have declined it and contacted Nissan Finance. She didnt think that there was 
anything more that it could do as, when it was made aware of the complaint, Mrs C had 
bought the new car.
Mrs Cs husband, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He says, in summary, that:
the car was unsafe  and hes provided a letter from a third party about the 
replacement car  and there were ongoing communications which continued after the 
car was replaced;
compensation was agreed with the manufacturers UK representative and it asked for 
particulars of Mrs Cs financial losses which were provided, totalling £7,121  and 
bank details were requested and supplied for a settlement payment;
the 20% discount was in addition to that and was a deal that was available to other 
customers at that time;
Nissan Finance hasnt said that a refund isnt due and fairly payable so must provide 
a comprehensive response; and
its not appropriate to reach a view on the balance of probabilities and what most 
likely happened, in the light of available evidence and wider circumstances.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  and where the evidence is incomplete, 
inconclusive or contradictory, as some of it is here, I have to make my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have 
happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances;
Nissan Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs C - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs C was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for her to expect that it would be free from even minor defects ;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mrs C has complained about a number of issues with the car which she says started 
the day after the car was supplied to her and she says that the dealer arranged for 
the car to be inspected by an independent expert in December 2019;
the manufacturers UK representative became involved and it agreed that Mrs C 
could exchange the car through the dealer for a new car with a 20% discount on the 
price  I dont consider it to be likely that it would have done so unless there was an 
issue with the car that caused it not to have been of satisfactory quality;
Mrs Cs husband has provided a letter from September 2021 from a third party which 
inspected the car before it was returned (although the registration number provided is 
that of the replacement car) which says, amongst other things, that the car is 
defective;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when 
it was supplied to Mrs C;
its my understanding that the manufacturers UK representative asked Mrs C for 
information about her financial losses  which she provided  but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that it agreed to pay the amount that she 
claimed to her as compensation;
although there were some issues with the car and I consider that it wasnt of 
satisfactory quality, Mrs C was able to use the car and I dont consider it to be likely 
that the manufacturers UK representative would have agreed to refund to her 30 
monthly payments under the agreement (the result of which would have been that 
she, in effect, had free use of the car) and to refund the other amounts that shed 
claimed as well as replacing the car with a new car with a 20% discount on the price;I consider that allowing Mrs C to return the car in September 2020 after about 30 
months of use, settling the hire purchase agreement on that car, and replacing it with 
a brand new car with a 20% discount on the price was a fair way for her complaint 
about the car to be resolved  and if Mrs C had wanted a different outcome at that 
time I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her not to have accepted the 
replacement car;
Mrs C has complained about the service that shes received from the dealer and from 
the manufacturers UK representative but thats not something for which Nissan 
Finance is responsible and I consider that its response to Mrs Cs complaint was fair 
and reasonable and Im not persuaded that it has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Nissan Finance to pay 
any compensation to Mrs C or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
