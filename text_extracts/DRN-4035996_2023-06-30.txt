The complaint
Mrs M complains about errors by Barclays Bank UK Plc trading as Barclaycard that led to 
missed payments recorded on her credit file. 
What happened
Mrs M has a credit card with Barclaycard and has explained that it incorrectly billed her for 
two payments of £7.05 from March 2021. The payment was later refunded by Barclaycard in 
March 2022. 
On 2 December 2021 Barclaycard sent Mrs M a statement that said she needed to make a 
payment of £5.61 by 29 December 2021. The payment wasnt made by that date.
On 5 January 2022 Barclaycard sent the next statement that said Mrs M needed to make a 
payment of £11.59 by 31 January 2022. 
Mrs M made a payment of £5.61 on 10 January 2022. Mrs M spoke with Barclaycard on 10 
January 2022 to discuss late payment fee shed incurred the previous month and an agent 
agreed to refund it, along with associated interest. During the call, Mrs M asked about what 
payment she needed to make. The agent said account adjustments would show on the next 
months statement and she needed to pay £11.59. No further payments were received by 31 
January 2022. 
On 2 February 2022 Barclaycard sent Mrs M a monthly statement that said she needed to 
pay £11.37 by 28 February 2022. A payment of £12 was received by Barclaycard on 1 
March 2022. 
In December 2022 Mrs M complained after finding missed payment information on her credit 
file. Barclaycard sent Mrs M a final response but didnt agree it had made mistakes or 
recorded inaccurate information on her credit file. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mrs Ms complaint. They didnt thought Barclaycard 
had dealt with Mrs Ms complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mrs M asked to 
appeal and said that when she spoke with an agent at Barclaycard on 10 January 2022 they 
agreed to refund the late payment fee and advised no further payment was required that 
month. Mrs M also explained she was owed £7.05 by Barclaycard which was paid in March 
2022. As Mrs M asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
When Mrs M asked to appeal, she explained that Barclaycards agent in January 2022 told 
her that no further payment was due. I wanted to hear what the agent said, so I asked 
Barclaycard to provide a copy of that call recording. The call recording is reasonably long 
and Mrs M discussed the payment due in December 2021, the late payment fee and refund 
of £7.05. The agent confirmed the late payment fee would be refunded. But during the call, 
the agent said that the adjustments wouldnt show on Mrs Ms account until the following 
monthly statement was issued. And the agent explained Mrs M needed to make a payment 
of £11.59 by the date given on her statement. I appreciate Mrs M continued to explain that 
she didnt think any further payments were due, but at no point did I hear the agent tell her 
that was the case. Im sorry to disappoint Mrs M but having listened to the call, Im satisfied 
Barclaycard correctly explained Mrs M needed to pay £11.59 by the due date. 
Mrs M has explained that the refund of fees and interest were owed to her as a result of 
mistakes by Barclaycard. But the agent advised that the amendments wouldnt take 
immediate effect and, as Ive said above, confirmed Mrs M still needed to make the minimum 
payment quoted in the January 2022 credit card statement. The agent also confirmed the 
refunds would only show on Mrs Ms next credit card statement. Im satisfied Barclaycards 
agent correctly confirmed the process for applying refunds and that Mrs M still needed to 
make a payment. 
I understand why Mrs M is upset that the way payments were made has impacted her credit 
file. And I can see Mrs M made a payment of £5.61 on 10 January 2022. But that payment 
was made to make up the one that wasnt made in December 2021. Barclaycard has 
confirmed that because the payment was made within 14 days of the due date (28 
December 2021), it wasnt actually recorded as missed on Mrs Ms credit file. 
Barclaycards records show the payment that was due by 31 January 2022 has been 
recorded as missed with the credit reference agencies. Whilst I can see Mrs M did pay £5.61 
on 10 January 2022, she needed to pay £11.59 by 31 January 2022. As the full payment due 
in January 2022 wasnt made, Im satisfied Barclaycard has correctly recorded that payment 
as missed on Mrs Ms credit file. Im sorry to disappoint Mrs M but I havent been persuaded 
it was unreasonable for Barclaycard to record the January 2022 payment as missed n her 
credit file. 
The next payment of £11.37 was due on 28 February 2022 and Barclaycard received it on 1 
March 2022. Barclaycards records confirmed this payment hasnt been recorded as missed 
or late on Mrs Ms credit file. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mrs M but I havent been persuaded that Barclaycard made a 
mistake in terms of the information its recorded on her credit file. I appreciate there was a 
refund due relating to payments made during the early part of 2021. But the refund didnt 
influence what Mrs M needed to pay, as set out on the credit card statements Barclaycard 
issued. And, having listened to Mrs Ms call with Barclaycard, Im satisfied its agent correctly 
confirmed she still needed to make a payment in January 2022 which wasnt subsequently 
received. As Im satisfied Barclaycard dealt with Mrs Ms complaint fairly and has recorded 
accurate information on her credit file Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2023.
