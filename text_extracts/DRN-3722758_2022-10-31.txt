The complaint
Ms M complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc managed her personal current 
account mortgage, in the last few months. She said it didnt warn her that a reduction in her 
borrowing facility would freeze her account, and affect her credit file.
What happened
Ms M said she had a NatWest One account mortgage, which she chose because she didnt 
have to stick to a regular payment schedule. She said she paid in smaller amounts during 
the year, then once or twice a year would pay in a large lump sum when she received 
income from her investments.
Ms M said she extended her mortgage in 2020, so it would run for two additional years to 
2022. She said the borrowing facility was gradually reduced over the last two years, which 
she expected. But Ms M said that although shed explained to NatWest a number of times 
(on 22 December, 11 March and 14 March) that she pays in lump sums, NatWest still froze 
the account on 10 March.
Ms M said her monthly income had been paid into the account that month, and when 
NatWest froze the account she couldnt access money to pay her daily living expenses or 
direct debits. She had to ask her family to help her. 
Ms M said she had then paid the final lump sum in early April, and was planning to close the 
account ahead of schedule. 
Ms M said she was told that a bad credit report would be made for her because of what 
happened in March, and she was appalled. She said no one had listened to her, looked at 
her previous account conduct, or been clear that her account would be frozen. She said 
shed assumed, mistakenly, that having explained this to NatWest many times, it would see 
that she pays in lump sums and allow the account to continue without a bad credit report. 
Ms M said NatWest had offered £75 compensation for poor communications, but she wanted 
the bad credit report rescinded, or amended at the very least. And she repeated that no one 
tried to help for the three weeks when she had no access to money.
NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said it wrote to Ms M on 10 January 2022 
to remind her about the upcoming facility reduction. Unfortunately Ms M was over her facility 
when this reduction was actioned, so her card was then declined. 
NatWest said it had followed the right process, and correct advice was given about how Ms 
Ms credit file could be affected. It did offer her £75, but that was because she spent a long 
time on hold on one call, then was transferred to the wrong department, and because when 
it wrote to her it didnt include a complaint leaflet. 
When this complaint came to us, NatWest said when it reduced Ms Ms borrowing facility in 
March 2021, it told her that a further reduction would be made a year later, in March 2022. It 
then reminded her about this upcoming reduction again in January 2022. And it wrote to her 
when the reduction was actioned in March 2022. NatWest showed us notes of Ms Ms 
complaint, which said she thought it should have called her about this, but NatWest felt it 
had done enough to let Ms M know about the upcoming change. .
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He felt that NatWest had done 
enough to notify Ms M of the upcoming reduction to her borrowing. 
Ms M said all she wanted was for the bank to amend her credit report. She said NatWest 
should also review the letters it writes, because the letter NatWest sent in January didnt 
explain to her that her account would be frozen if she went over the reduced facility from 10 
March. Ms M said because she had already spoken to them, she thought that NatWest had 
accepted she would pay the full amount only three weeks after this reduction. Ms M said if 
NatWest had been clearer about the consequences, she could have acted differently. 
Ms M said she was also appalled at an ageist comment from the bank, she said that her age 
has nothing to do with her ability to manage her finances.
Ms M then wrote again to say that she understood the bank had made a negative credit 
report reflecting her mortgage position after the facility was reduced. She said she would 
also expect it to make an additional report to make clear the account was in debt for a period 
of less than one month and the full sum was then paid off. She believed this would then lead 
to a correction in her credit rating, but she had no faith that NatWest would do this. And she 
now also wanted to complain about the bank having an ageist policy. She said many people 
are working well into their seventies now and are more competent to conduct their financial 
affairs than people half their age. 
Ms M wanted an ombudsman to consider her complaint, so this case was passed to me for a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
Ms M has an offset current account mortgage. This is quite a complex sort of mortgage, 
which doesnt request regular monthly repayments, but instead requires Ms M to be 
proactive about bringing the overall borrowing down. 
When NatWest extended Ms Ms mortgage in 2020 for a further two years, it reminded her of 
how the mortgage worked.
With the One account please remember that we dont collect a fixed monthly 
mortgage payment. Well always apply interest to your account each month but its 
up to you how quickly or slowly you repay your borrowing. You can make lump sum 
or regular payments into the account at any time or you can miss monthly payments 
completely. All we ask is that your borrowing does not exceed your facility and 
that you repay it by the end of the mortgage term. [emphasis added]
I think it was reasonably clear that Ms M had a responsibility to bring down her mortgage so 
that it stayed within the facility. And I can see that NatWest wrote to Ms M regularly, with the 
aim of helping her to stay on track with that. Ms M has told us that she rang NatWest in December 2021 and told it she planned to make 
a lump sum payment in April. But she didnt contact it again after it wrote to her in January 
2022, telling her it was reducing her borrowing facility in March. I think that if Ms M had 
understood NatWest had agreed on a December 2021 call to her not paying down her 
borrowing before April, then I would have expected her, on receiving the January letter, to 
query why her borrowing facility was being reduced before this, in early March.
In March, NatWest did reduce Ms Ms borrowing. Unfortunately Ms M hadnt yet paid in any 
lump sum, and she was left considerably overdrawn. This account operates as a current 
account, and Ms M was left with no access to funds at that time. She told us she had to rely 
on family for funds. I know Ms M feels that no one at NatWest tried to help, but NatWest has 
told us that once it makes a reduction like this, it just isnt able to undo it.
Ms M has now paid off this mortgage entirely, with a lump sum payment in April, as she said 
she would do. What she wants our service to do is make sure that her credit file isnt affected 
by having exceeded her borrowing facility in March.
Im sorry to have to tell Ms M that I dont think its fair and reasonable to ask NatWest to 
remove the negative mark that it placed on Ms Ms credit file. Thats for two reasons. 
Firstly, NatWest has agreed with credit reference agencies (CRAs) that it will make a true 
report of the status of Ms Ms account. It does that in return for receiving up to date and 
accurate information from other lenders. And providing a true report of how someones 
managing their account is part of a legally binding agreement NatWest reaches with the 
CRAs. 
But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I also dont think its unfair for NatWest to have 
made this report to CRAs. I know Ms M has found this very upsetting, but NatWest did give 
her notice of the reduction in her borrowing facility. Im aware that NatWest didnt highlight 
the impact that this would have, but Ive also got to take into account that Ms M had 
operated this sort of mortgage for many years. And Ive explained that if she was concerned 
about the timing of her facility reduction, as set out in the January 2022 reminder letter, I 
would have expected her to speak to the bank before the reduction was made.
Ms M said she had no faith that NatWest would then update the CRAs to say her account 
had since been paid in full, and closed. Ive said I would expect NatWests report to CRAs to 
be a true and accurate reflection of the conduct of her account. And that means I would also 
expect this reporting to reflect when her account was closed. I cannot comment on whether 
this will improve Ms Ms credit score, as a credit score is something set by the CRAs, not by 
lenders like NatWest. 
I wont say any more on this here, because Ms Ms complaint to us predates the closure of 
this account. And our service has to give businesses an opportunity to consider complaint 
issues before we seek to resolve them. Here, it doesnt look as if NatWest has been asked 
about this. Its not clear whether or not anything has actually gone wrong. So I would ask Ms 
M to discuss this with NatWest in the first instance. 
Ms M also wanted me to consider that NatWest had been ageist. I can see NatWest set out 
that it extended Ms Ms borrowing until 2022, which took Ms M past the age that NatWest 
would normally set as a longstop for borrowing. But again, its not appropriate for me to 
comment on that here, because Ms M hasnt yet raised any concerns about this with 
NatWest. So again, I would ask Ms M to discuss this with NatWest in the first instance. 
I understand Ms M is unlikely to agree with me, and she is likely to be disappointed by this, 
but, on the complaint issue I can consider here, I dont think NatWest has been unfair or unreasonable. And for the reasons Ive set out above, I dont think her complaint should be 
upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2022.
