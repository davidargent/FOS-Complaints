The complaint
Miss S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA took payments from her credit card 
without her permission.
What happened
In June 2022, Miss S made several transactions from her PayPal account. She said she 
expected PayPal to recover the payments from her current account ***7524 or from her debit 
card ***7168.  But PayPal took the payments from her credit card ****4809. Miss S said she 
hadnt given PayPal permission to do this and despite her requests they refused to refund 
the transactions back to her credit card. Miss S said this meant shed to cancel her credit 
card leaving her and her young family in financial difficulty. Miss S said that PayPal should 
have continued to try to recover the funds form her current account, but they didnt. She 
complained to PayPal.
PayPal said that theyd requested the payments from Miss S current account but these had 
been denied. Her credit card was held on her account as a back up funding source. They d 
recovered two of the payments £42.23 and £35.08 from Miss S credit card, but several other 
payments had been declined by her bank and credit card provider. This left Miss S PayPal 
account with a negative balance of £25.30. PayPal said they acted in accordance with their 
User Agreement, but to resolve the complaint they said theyd settle the negative balance 
showing in Miss S PayPal account.
Miss S wasnt happy about PayPals response as she said the negative balance could have 
been avoided if theyd kept requesting the payments from her current account as sufficient 
funds became available. She referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly or unreasonably in seeking payments 
for the transactions from a funding source that was available to them.
Miss S didnt agree and has asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why. 
I can see why Miss S is upset as she feels strongly that shed not given PayPal permission 
to recover payments from her credit card. While I empathise with the position Miss S finds 
himself in, for me to say PayPal must do something different I must first be satisfied that 
theyve done something wrong. I cant see that they have here which is why I wont be 
asking them to do anything else.
When Miss S opened her account with PayPal she would have had to agree to the terms 
and conditions of PayPals User Agreement. So, Ive considered this in determining my 
decision. PayPals User Agreement says:
You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your 
account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user 
agreement..
And says:
You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account. Subject to this 
user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for 
payments you send from your account.
And goes on to explain about how funding payments are sent from an account.
We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the 
following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:
1. Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)
2. Preferred funding source (if selected and available)
3. Pre-existing PayPal balance
4. Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)
5. PayPal Credit (where available)
6. PayPal-branded debit card (where available)
7. PayPal-branded credit card (where available)
8. Debit card
9. Credit card
10. Bank account (eCheque) 
So, I think its clear that payments leaving Miss S account could be taken from a linked 
funding source, and from a number of available sources, including credit cards.
The User Agreement also explains:
By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to
automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of
any mandate (e.g. bank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up
and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:
To cover:
The payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your
account to send a payment to another user.
Im satisfied for PayPal to charge Miss S credit card it must have been available to them as 
a funding source. And by Miss S accepting the User Agreement terms and conditions she 
would be giving her continuous permission.
PayPals records show the date and the amount of transactions that were made:
24.06.22 25.06.22 26.06.22 28.06.22 29.06.22
£42.23 £35.08 £7.95 £9.48 £15.82Miss S said her default funding source was her current account ****7524. I can see from 
PayPals records that for all of the above transactions they attempted to recover the funds 
from Miss S preferred funding source, first  but the requests were denied.  As the 
transactions of £42.23 and £35.08 were declined by Miss S bank, PayPal sought redress 
from another funding source linked to her PayPal account, her credit card ****4809, and 
these payments were accepted on 1 July 2022.
The remaining three transactions £15.82, £9.48 and £7.95 were all initially denied by Miss S 
bank and rejected by her credit card provider. On 11 July 2022 the transaction for £7.95 was 
accepted by Miss S bank. But the remaining two transactions totalling £25.30 went 
unrecovered, placing Miss S PayPal account in a negative balance.
From what Ive seen, PayPal appears to have processed the transactions correctly. I cant 
say PayPal did anything wrong as Miss S had sent the payments from her PayPal account 
and so the money was owed. They requested the payments initially from her preferred 
funding source and when this was declined, they used an available funding source, her 
credit card. But some requests for the payments to be taken from both preferred and 
available funding sources were declined. I understand PayPal has agreed to clear the 
outstanding balance of £25.30, as I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably its 
for Miss S to decide whether to accept this offer or not.
I know Miss S said she suffered financially as she said shed reported her credit card as 
lost/stolen because of PayPals actions. And had to wait for a new card to be sent out, but 
the cancellation of her credit card was her decision. PayPals User Agreement says:
You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.
So, I think Miss S could have chosen to unlink her credit card from her PayPal account 
which would have removed it as an available funding source. Instead she asked her credit 
card provider to cancel her credit card and to issue a replacement..
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 December 2022.
