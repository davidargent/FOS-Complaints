K821x#15complaint
Mr W is unhappy with the service he received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA.
background
Mr W has an account with PayPal. He attempted to make a payment to a third party  but this 
failed. It seems the cause  for this was Mr Ws bank and this has been dealt with separately.  
Mr W remains unhappy with the service he received from PayPal  when trying  to understand 
the reasons for this failed  payment. Mr W has said that following emails  and phone calls, he 
was promised a call back from PayPal  where further  clarification would  be given. Mr W was 
then sent a written  response and was very unsatisfied with this. Subsequent calls were 
made, but Mr W was unhappy PayPal  hadnt done  what  it said it would in the first instance.
Our investigator thought PayPal had most likely promised a call back that didnt happen,  and 
that this caused  Mr W frustration and inconvenience. He recommended  PayPal pay Mr W 
£25 in recognition of this. Mr W accepted, but PayPal didnt. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal hasnt shared  a copy  of the call recording in question. So I dont  know  exactly what 
was said. But I think it is clear from Mr Ws response  to the email he received that he had 
expected a call. And that he was extremely frustrated by not receiving this.
I dont think PayPal should be required to specifically call customers and, generally, there 
would be no problem writing to a customer.  But I do think that PayPal should do what it says 
it will do. I think its most likely that PayPal agreed to call Mr W, but that it wrote  to him 
instead. And I think that this caused Mr W trouble and upset.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  pay 
Mr W £25 if it hasnt already done  so. Under  the rules  of the Financial  Ombudsman  Service, 
Im required  to ask Mr W to accept or reject my decision  before  21 February 2019.
