The complaint
Mrs H says AXA France IARD (AXA) mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy.
What happened
Mrs H bought the policy in 1999 in connection with a store card.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Hs case. 
Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Hs complaint and Ive set out my reasons below:
Mrs Hs store card application form was completed to show that she wanted the PPI. 
She signed the relevant section of the form to accept the cover. Card protection was 
also available on the form, but it seems Mrs H chose not to take that. So I think she 
wouldve realised she had a choice about whether or not to buy the PPI. 
From what Ive seen, Im satisfied that AXA made Mrs H aware that the policy was 
optional.
AXA didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs H so it didnt have to check if it was suitable 
for her. That means it didnt have to ask about her circumstances, or whether she 
had any other means to cover her repayments.
Its possible the information AXA gave Mrs H about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
should have been. But its unlikely Mrs H would have been affected by any of the 
main things the policy didnt cover, and the policy had a reasonable benefit. So I 
dont think better information wouldve stopped her buying it. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
