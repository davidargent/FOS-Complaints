The complaint
Mrs R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs R entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that she signed in 
August 2010 to pay for a holiday product. Mrs Rs husband was also involved in the 
purchase of the holiday product (but not the credit card agreement which was in Mrs Rs sole 
name) but he has sadly passed away since this complaint was made and Ive not seen the 
contract for the purchase. Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit card account was 
closed in March 2011. 
Mrs R and her husband complained to Barclays Partner Finance in March 2020 about its 
arrangements with the holiday company and they asked for information about the 
commission arrangements, the holiday companys authorisation to act as a credit 
intermediary and the affordability checks that were undertaken before the loan was made. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that they were out of time under the Limitation Act 1980 to 
bring any claim in respect of the issues that they claimed to have happened at the point of 
sale regarding the timeshare agreement. Mrs Rs representative then made a complaint to 
this service in March 2021 about a number of issues, including that the holiday company 
wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the timeshare had been misrepresented to Mrs R and 
her husband, no credit checks were carried out and the interest rate was high.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Rs complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of her misrepresentation claim to 
turn it down. He didnt think that Mrs R was able to make a claim under section 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act but he thought that Barclays Partner Finance was also entitled to rely 
on the timing of the claim to turn it down. He said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to 
suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs R.
Mrs Rs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
our investigator hasnt considered the authorisation or identity of the credit broker;
Mrs R couldnt have possibly known at the time of sale about the misrepresentations 
and didnt know about them until she brought her complaint; and
the enforcement of (or seeking to enforce) an unfair agreement is itself unfair, so that 
the debtor has a continuing cause of action which subsists as long as the agreement 
is current.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Rs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Mrs Rs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
but Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court 
would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Rs claim under section 75 is that the holiday product was misrepresented to her 
and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, 
Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim 
was brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it 
would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs R could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced them into 
buying the holiday product in August 2010 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when she also entered into the credit card agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner 
Finance until March 2020, more than nine years later, which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her claim under section 75 is now 
time-barred;
Mrs Rs representative says that Mrs R only became aware that she could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance when she made her complaint  
but when she had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes 
of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs Rs 
claims;
Mrs R entered into the credit card agreement in August 2010 so I consider that 
section 140A applies to that agreement - section 140A gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit card agreement was closed in March 
2011 - and Ive seen no evidence to show that it continued after that date - so Mrs R 
would have had six years from then to bring a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance about an unfair relationship with her  but a claim wasnt made until March 
2020, about nine years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that her claim under section 140A is also now time-
barred; 
Mrs Rs representative says that the holiday company acted as an unauthorised 
broker but it hasnt provide evidence to show that the credit broker for the credit card 
agreement wasnt authorised  my role is to make a decision on the information 
provided to me by Mrs R, her representative and Barclays Partner Finance and Im 
not persuaded that Mrs R and her representative have provided enough evidence to 
show that the credit broker wasnt authorised to arrange the credit for Mrs R in 
August 2010;
Mrs R says that no credit checks were carried out by Barclays Partner Finance 
before the credit was provided to her  but Barclays Partner Finance says that the 
credit card agreement was closed in March 2011 and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the credit wasnt affordable for Mrs R when it was made available to her or that 
shes experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs R asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its credit checks before March 2020  as the credit was made 
available to her in August 2010 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to 
have raised any concerns about the credit checks before then and I consider it to be 
more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or the affordability of 
the credit would now be time-barred;
Mrs Rs representative says that the high interest rate that Mrs R was expected to 
pay is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mrs R signed the credit card 
agreement which clearly set out the rate of interest and included a six month buy 
now  pay later offer  the agreement also said, immediately above Mrs Rs 
signature: This is a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms  the agreement also set out 
her right to cancel the credit card agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
she tried to do so within the cancellation period;
Mrs R asked Barclays Partner Finance about its commission arrangements and the 
amount of commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the credit  
but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally 
paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mrs R risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Barclays Partner Finance issued its response to Mrs Rs complaint in October 2020 
and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to apply the provisions of the 
Limitation Act and Im not persuaded that the outcome that it reached was unfair or 
unreasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mrs R for the loss of her husband and also for the issues that shes 
had with her holiday product, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the 
money that she paid under the credit card agreement, to pay her any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
