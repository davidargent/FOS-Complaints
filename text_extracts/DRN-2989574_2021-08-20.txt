The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA placed a limitation on his account and
told him contradictory information about identification which would lift the limitation.  
What happened
PayPal placed a limitation on Mr Ss account on 15 October 2020. This resulted in him being
unable to withdraw his £140 balance. Mr S used the chat facility on 25 October 2020 to find
out why his account was limited. PayPal informed him the limitation was regarding the
verification of his selling portfolio, to make sure that his selling activities aligns with their
terms and conditions under the Selling Protection Program.
Mr S says he was told that he would need to send either a passport or driving licence to
PayPal to verify his identity and then the account limitation could be lifted. Mr S informed
PayPal he did not want to give them his passport details and asked how people who dont
have passports or driving licences could be verified. PayPal said he would be able to submit
a birth certificate only if there was a supporting document also sent to them such as a bank
statement dated within the last 12 months.
As Mr S didnt have access to his birth certificate, he applied for one. Mr S was able to
obtain a birth certificate and this was dated 29 December 2020. Mr S contacted PayPal on
12 January 2021 via the chat facility to ask where he needed to send his birth certificate for
verification. The PayPal agent informed Mr S that birth certificates were previously accepted
as proof of identification together with a supporting document but from their recent updates
their back office team no longer accepted birth certificate as proof of identity.
The PayPal agent said she would arrange a call back with the manager who informed Mr S
that a birth certificate would be accepted as proof of identity, so they can clarify to him the
update and how he can resolve the limitations on his account. Mr S brought his complaint to
our service. He said he was unable to pay for Christmas presents for family members and
had to borrow money from his family to pay for his council tax for three months (£225).
On 24 January 2021 PayPal messaged Mr S and explained the limitation could be lifted on
his account if he uploaded proof of his identity. The agent provided a list of acceptable
documents which included a birth certificate along with supporting documents, which
included a bank statement. The message also explained how he could upload these
documents and stated once they were uploaded, the limitation would be reviewed in five
days.
Our investigator forwarded PayPal Mr Ss birth certificate and bank statement. PayPal then
removed the limitation on Mr Ss account. Our investigator upheld Mr Ss complaint and
thought £200 was fair and reasonable compensation as Mr S should have been considered
a vulnerable customer based on his personal circumstances. He also said that because
PayPal had originally agreed to accept a birth certificate, which was outside of their normal
process, it does show that Mr S was told incorrect information in January when he was told
PayPal couldnt accept a birth certificate. This caused Mr S significant inconvenience and
distress. PayPal did not accept the view of our investigator and wanted an Ombudsman to
review the complaint.  
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive considered and
read everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and
informal body Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and
reasonable here.
The first thing Ive considered here is whether PayPal were entitled to place the limitation on
Mr Ss account. As the PayPal User Agreement states they can: At any time and without
liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access to our websites, software, systems (including
any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on
our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability
to pay or send money with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account,
restricting your ability to send money or make withdrawals. So I am persuaded that PayPal
were entitled to place a limitation on Mr Ss account, even if he feels he has done nothing
wrong, based on the User Agreement he would have agreed to when he joined PayPal.
Next, Ive considered the requirements of PayPal to lift his limitation. Im satisfied that
PayPal were entitled to ask for identification from Mr S to prove his identity. As Mr S did not
have access to his passport and told PayPal he would not provide them with his passport
details then I would expect that PayPal would have a workaround for customers who did not
have photographic identification. Ive looked at the chat history that Mr S had with PayPal
and on 26 October 2020 he was told well if you cannot submit either documents, we may
accept your birth certificate only if there is a supporting document. In this case Mr S could
not submit his passport. So even if Mr S did not tell PayPal the actual reasons for not being
able to send his passport details to them, PayPal did confirm they would be able to accept
his birth certificate as long as there was a supporting document.
As Mr S did not have access to a birth certificate then he would need to get a new one. I
dont think its fair to hold PayPal responsible for the time it would take to get a new birth
certificate or any delays in Mr S getting a new birth certificate as this would be outside of
their control.
Mr S has said that because of the limitation on his account that he was unable to pay for
Christmas presents for his family and had to borrow from his family to meet his council tax
payments and other items. But as the birth certificate was dated 29 December 2020, the
limitation would not be able to be lifted before Christmas when using a birth certificate as
identification. Im persuaded that due to his financial situation at the time its likely he
wouldve needed to borrow money from his family regardless of whether there was a
limitation on his account or not. I say this as he had a balance of £140 when PayPal placed
the limitation on his account. But he needed to borrow £225 to pay for council tax. So Mr S
needed access to more money than what was in his PayPal account. Although Mr S may
have been able to sell other items if there was no limitation on his account, PayPal were
entitled to place the limitation on his account. So Mr S would always need acceptable
identification to lift the limitation. Im persuaded that one of the biggest factors in the delay of
removing the limitation was the time it took to obtain the birth certificate.
Once the birth certificate was obtained, Ive considered what happened next. The chat
history shows that it was 12 January 2021 when Mr S asks PayPal where to send his birthcertificate. So as this is the first day that Mr S has made PayPal aware he has the correct
identification, then what I would expect PayPal to do here is explain where to send the
identification and look into removing the limitation. But this isnt what happened here. Mr S
was told the birth certificate was previously accepted as a proof of identification together
with a supporting document but from our recent updates our back office team no longer
accept birth certificate as proof of identity.
Mr S was told to keep your lines open for a call back from the manager who previously
informed Mr S that PayPal could accept a birth certificate as identification. This was later
reiterated in the chat when the agent said Mr S would get a call from the supervisor of the
representative who told (him the) birth certificate (would be accepted) will call (Mr S). This
was stated in the chat history that PayPal sent our service. I asked PayPal if the manager
made this call to Mr S but they replied that they had no notes advising of a call back. I asked
Mr S if he received a call back as the chat history stated he would. Mr S said he never
received this phone call. Im persuaded that a lack of a phone call would have been
incredibly frustrating for Mr S. I say this because had Mr S received a phone call from a
manager/supervisor then I would expect they would have knowledge of the available
workaround when photographic identification could not be submitted - as they had
previously explained this to Mr S and the issue couldve been resolved quicker than it was.
The chat history shows Mr S asking for his money on 23 January 2021. PayPal responded to
Mr S on 24 January 2021 with a list of acceptable documents to lift the limitation. Amongst
the list is a birth certificate along with supporting documents (bank statement, council tax
bill). The chat history continues where Mr S is shown how to upload these documents.
There is no acknowledgement that the process has changed again, allowing Mr S to use a
birth certificate after being told 12 days prior that he wasnt able to. So Im persuaded that
this was a workaround all along, but the agent who informed Mr S that he couldnt use his
birth certificate was unaware of the workaround. Ill explain why below.
I asked PayPal for dates of when the process changed regarding accepting birth certificates
for identification if a customer was unable to submit photo identification. PayPal said they
were unable to give me dates of these changes but they would always ask for photo
identification first and birth certificates were workarounds to photo identification and would
be used in situations where account holders did not have photo identification. As Mr S did
not have access to photo identification then Im persuaded that PayPal should have
accepted his birth certification as a workaround. I say this as he was originally told this in
October 2020 when the limitation was first applied and he was told this 12 days after PayPal
said they couldnt accept his birth certificate. Our investigator sent the identification
documents to PayPal on 31 March 2021 by sending Mr Ss birth certificate as one of the
forms of identification. PayPal then lifted the limitation on his account. So Im persuaded
since PayPal had this workaround in place then this should have been used.
Ive considered the impact this would have had on Mr S. He asked PayPal where to send the
identification on 12 January 2021. And he was told on this date that he couldnt use his birth
certificate as identification. So Im persuaded that this is when the inconvenience started for
Mr S. Although he had the inconvenience of a limitation being placed on his account, PayPal
were entitled to do so when they had security concerns. And Mr S also had inconvenience of
waiting until the end of December 2020 to get his birth certificate, I cant hold PayPal
responsible for delays in a birth certificate being issued. Im persuaded that the
inconvenience lasted 12 days. I say this as from the chat history, Mr S is told that he can
send the birth certificate as identification and is told how to send it. Although the limitation
did not get lifted until several months after, until our investigator sent the documents to
PayPal, Mr S would have been able to do this himself from 24 January 2021. So I dont
believe its fair to hold PayPal responsible for any further delays in Mr S sending them his
identification.As PayPal did have a workaround in place to accept a birth certificate when a customer was
unable to submit photo identification and then told Mr S that they couldnt accept the birth
certificate after he had paid for a new one then I do believe this unnecessarily
inconvenienced Mr S. Our investigator suggested that PayPal should pay Mr S £200 for
additional significant distress and inconvenience. But Im not persuaded this is reasonable
and Ill explain why.
As Ive mentioned previously, I believe that the inconvenience was limited to 12 days  from
12 January when Mr S was told that he couldnt use his birth certificate to 24 January when
he was told where to send his birth certificate. If Mr S was significantly distressed by the
events here, I would expect him to send the required documents at the first opportunity he
had. The documents were sent on 31 March, over two months after he could have sent
them. Mr S has shared some personal information with us with why he couldnt send PayPal
his passport. But as PayPal werent aware of his individual circumstances then I cant say
they should have known from the information he gave them that he could be potentially
vulnerable. And they were within their rights to limit the account and wait for identification to
lift the limitation regardless of someones personal circumstances at the time they did this.
Based on the reasons Ive already given Im persuaded that PayPals actions will have
caused Mr S inconvenience. He was told that they could not accept his birth certificate after
previously being told this could be accepted. And then he wasnt given a phone call from the
manager/supervisor after he was told he would receive a call back by PayPal. Im persuaded
this will have increased the frustration that Mr S had with the situation. For this I intend to
ask PayPal to pay Mr S £100 for the inconvenience caused by their actions
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. Neither party responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party responded to my provisional decision then my final decision and reasoning
remain the same. It follows that Ill now be telling PayPal what theyll need to do to put things
right here.  
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I suggested PayPal should pay Mr S £100 for the inconvenience 
they caused him and Im still satisfied this is a fair outcome for the reasons given previously. 
 
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr S £100 compensation 
for inconvenience. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2021.
