The complaint
Mr W complains that the loans he had from MYJAR Limited were unaffordable.
What happened
Mr W had 4 loans from Myjar between February 2016 and May 2016 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Scheduled 
Repayment*Due Repaid
1 10 Feb 2016 £100 7d £107.20 19 Feb 2016 On time
2 19 Feb 2016 £150 3m £80.14 27 May 2016 29 Feb 2016
3 12 Mar 2016 £150 3m £79.58 17 Jun 2016 13 May 2016
4 19 May 2016 £200 3m £107.60 26 Aug 201629 Dec 2016
Payment plan
Mr W says if Myjar had carried out proper checks it would not have approved the lending. He 
says he had other short-term loans, as well as credit union accounts at the time and the 
repayments were unaffordable to him. Mr W adds that he had to borrow further money to 
repay the loans which hes still paying off.
Myjar says it asked Mr W about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It 
says that based on the information it had, it found all the loans to be affordable and it 
considered it had carried out proportionate checks.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She found that Myjar 
carried out proportionate checks and that there was nothing in the available information to 
indicate the loans were unaffordable.
Mr W responded to say, in summary, that hed taken out four loans in three months totalling 
£600 and that this was in addition to other borrowing. He added that Myjar would have seen 
his income and outgoings fluctuated had it done better checks.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Myjar needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied Myjar carried out enough checks before it approved these loans. The required 
repayments were a small proportion of Mr Ws declared income and there was nothing in the 
available information to indicate the loans were unaffordable.
Loan 3
Mr W repaid loan 2 within ten days and there was a small break before he applied for loan 3. 
Again, the repayments were a small proportion of Mr Ws declared income and he had a 
good repayment history. I dont think there was anything to suggest Myjar should have 
carried out better checks and so I cant conclude it was wrong to have approved loan 3.
Loan 4
Mr W repaid loan 3 early and applied for loan 4 six days later. Although the loan amount, 
and repayments, were slightly higher, Mr W had also declared a higher income. Myjar also 
asked him about his expenditure and checked his credit file. I cant see there was anything in 
the available information that should have indicated to Myjar it needed to verify the 
information provided by Mr W. Based on all the available information, I find it reasonable that 
Myjar approved loan 4.
I acknowledge Mr W says he had other loans outstanding, including other short-term loans, 
but Myjar was entitled to rely on the information Mr W provided at these early stages of a 
lending relationship and its calculations showed all four loans to be affordable.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2020.
