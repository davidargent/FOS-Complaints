The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua and Marbles lent irresponsibly when it 
approved his credit card applications and later increased the credit limit.
What happened
Mr B applied for a Marbles credit card in October 2016. In his application, Mr B said he was 
employed earning around £23,500 and a tenant. NewDay looked at Mr Bs credit file and 
found a County Court Judgement (CCJ), a default, a settled payment arrangement and a 
settled debt management plan (DMP). 
NewDay approved the application and sent Mr B a credit card with a £300 credit limit. 
In February 2018 Mr B applied for an Aqua credit card with NewDay. In this application, Mr B 
said his income was £54,400. NewDay completed a credit search and found the same 
adverse credit noted above. NewDay approved the Aqua application with a credit limit of 
£450.
In August 2018 the Aqua credit limit was increased to £1,350. In January 2019 the Aqua 
credit limit was increased to £2,100. 
Last year, Mr B complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly when it approved his 
Marbles and Aqua credit cards and increased the credit limit. NewDay didnt uphold Mr Bs 
complaint. 
An investigator at this service upheld Mr Bs complaint and said NewDay had lent 
irresponsibly when it approved the credit limit increases to £1,350 and £2,100 on his Aqua 
credit card. Aqua didnt accept and asked to appeal so Mr Bs complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mr B could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement;
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
Ive considered both credit card applications. I note that NewDay didnt find lots of open 
unsecured credit in Mr Bs name and set reasonably modest credit limits of £300 and £450. 
Given the amounts involved and information NewDay had available, Im satisfied it carried 
out proportionate checks. I havent found that NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved 
Mr Bs Marbles and Aqua credit cards. 
NewDay increased the credit limit of its Aqua card from £450 to £1,350 - three times the 
original credit limit. In addition, Mr B had made a substantial level of cash withdrawals in the 
months before. Whilst the credit card offers a cash advance facility and Mr B was using it in 
line with the account terms, I think that shouldve put NewDay on notice further checks 
should be considered. 
Given the level of the increase and way Mr B had used his Aqua card, I think NewDay 
shouldve carried out more comprehensive checks before deciding whether to increase his 
credit limit. An option NewDay couldve used is reviewing his existing credit card statements 
or asking for bank statements. There are other checks NewDay couldve carried out. 
Ive looked at Mr Bs credit card statements and can see multiple gambling transactions. 
Mr B has also sent us bank statements from the period in question. Those show a 
reasonably high level of gambling as well. 
Had NewDay carried out better checks, I think it wouldve found Mr B wasnt in a position to 
sustainably maintain payments for an increased credit limit on his Aqua card. 
In much the same way, I think NewDay shouldve done more before increasing Mr Bs Aqua 
credit limit again. The increase from £1,350 to £2,100 was reasonably large. Mr Bs Aqua 
statements show he continued to use his credit card for gambling, as do his bank 
statements. Again, I think better checks by NewDay wouldve led it to decline further credit 
limit increases on the basis Mr B was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay the increased 
balance. Im satisfied NewDay lent irresponsibly when it increased Mr Bs Aqua credit limit to 
£2,100. 
As NewDay lent irresponsibly, Im going to tell it to refund all interest and charges applied to 
balances over £450 on Mr Bs Aqua credit card from the date the credit limit increased 
onwards. In addition, it wouldnt be fair for NewDay to record adverse information about a 
credit card debt that was lent irresponsibly. So Im also going to tell it to remove any adverse 
information recorded about Mr Bs Aqua card from August 2018 onwards. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua to settle 
as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to balances over £450 on Mr Bs Aqua 
credit card the date of the credit limit increase onwards 
- If a balance remains once the above refund has been made, NewDay should work 
with Mr B to agree an affordable repayment plan
- Balances over £450 on Mr Bs Aqua credit card should be administered at 0% until 
repaid- NewDay should amend Mr Bs credit file to remove all adverse information recorded 
in relation to Mr Bs Aqua credit card from the date of the first credit limit increase  
onwards
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
