DRN-3049885
The complaint
 Miss D has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) continued charging 
her excessive amounts for her overdraft when she was in financial difficulty.
 
What happened
 Miss D complained to NatWest that its charges were unfair and were causing her financial 
difficulty. NatWest didnt uphold the complaint. And as Miss D was dis-satisfied she referred 
the complaint to our service.
Miss Ds complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. He thought that NatWest 
ought to have realised that Miss D was experiencing financial difficulty by 1 April 2015 and 
so shouldnt have added any more interest, fees and charges from this point onwards. 
NatWest didnt respond so the case was passed to an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when 
applying overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this 
decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, Im intending to find that NatWest acted 
unfairly when it continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from 1 April 2015. 
By this point, it ought to have been clear that Miss D was in no position to sustainably repay 
what she owed within a reasonable period of time. 
By this point, Miss D was hardcore borrowing. In other, words she hadnt maintained a credit 
balance for an extended period of time. NatWests own literature suggests that overdrafts 
are for unforeseen emergency borrowing not prolonged day-to-day expenditure. So I think 
that Miss Ds overdraft usage should have prompted NatWest to have realised that Miss D 
wasnt using her overdraft as intended and shouldnt have continued offering it on the same 
terms. As NatWest didnt react to Miss Ds overdraft usage and instead continued charging 
in the same way, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably. 
Miss D ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges on their overdraft and this 
ended up exacerbating difficulties she already had in trying to clear it. So I think that 
NatWest didnt treat Miss D fairly and she lost out because of what NatWest did wrong. And 
this means that it should put things right. 
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Miss Ds complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Miss Ds current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and 
charges applied to it after the renewal in 1 April 2015 are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Miss D to arrange a suitable repayment plan 
for this. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on Miss Ds 
credit file, it should reflect what would have been recorded had it started the 
process of taking corrective action on the overdraft in 1 April 2015.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Miss D along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Miss Ds credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.  
My final decision
 For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Ds complaint. National Westminster 
Bank Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
