Mr B complains that Oakam Ltd lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Using information from Oakam  and Mr B I have compiled a Loan Table. Ive tried to be as 
accurate as I can but there are several  refinancing arrangements, combined with additional 
fees at each stage.  This Loan  Table is for ease of reference and an overview only.

repaid
*Each loan was structured so the first payment was higher  than the subsequent regular
payments listed above. In addition, Oakam charged  fees for each loan which varied  from 
£40 for loan 1 to £133.07 for loan 4. These were part of the loan and attracted interest. 
Mr B applied for two subsequent loans in 2014  neither of which  were  given to him. He has 
repaid all his loans with Oakam in full.
Mr B explained to Oakam when it was investigating  his complaint in May 2018 that his bank 
statements reveal a number of payday  loans he was paying  for as well as the Oakam ones, 
and his addiction  to gambling.  He explained  to our adjudicator that: 
These loans were approved at a time when I had between  5 -8 other payday loans 
with other  lenders.
Each time I was accepted the value increased  and I was messaged and texted each 
time I was able to increase my loan.
This led me to a point were [sic] my finances could not be sustained and I had to 
keep finding ways to borrow more money  to get through each month. 
I was also a heavy  gambler which would have been  evident on my bank statements.
In its final response letter  to Mr B, Oakam said that the full credit checks  it carried out had 
shown to it that Mr B had active accounts  but Oakam considered  that they were managed 
Ref: DRN04025262well; that no accounts were in arrears,  and that the credit report  showed no other  signs of 
financial struggle.   
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought that Oakam should  put things 
right for Mr B from Loan 2 onwards. Oakam disagreed and responded with many  points 
including: the type of credit offered to Mr B; it referred to the Office of Fair Trading 
Irresponsible Lending Guide (OFT  ILG); its core mission;  its borrower-focussed  
assessments; it had looked at a number of Mr Bs bank statements and payslips before 
lending and it considered his gambling  but did not think the sums spent were a 
disproportionate sum of his income. 
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me for a decision. I issued a 
provisional decision on 11 June  2020  with a reply date of 11 July 2020. Mr B has responded 
and agreed with my provisional decision. 
My provisional findings are attached  to this final decision and form part of it. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am proceeding to Final  Decision  today  as this is one of our oldest cases  and Mr B has 
been waiting for a resolution since August 2018 when it commenced at this service. Oakam 
was asked if it was going  to respond  to my provisional decision. On 6 July 2020  it told us 
please be aware we do intend  to respond to the decision  made for [Mr Bs] complaint and 
should be able to do so by the end of next week. 
On 21 July 2020 Oakam had a query surrounding the County  Court  Judgment  I had referred 
to. I responded to that query with detail and a screenshot. I explained that I was going to 
draw this complaint  to a close and that I planned  to issue my final decision. I extended the 
reply date to 27 July 2020 and that meant Oakam have had from 11 June to 27 July 2020 to 
respond. I have not heard  from Oakam recently.  But in fairness to both parties I have 
decided to issue the Final Decision  as I think that Oakam has had adequate time to provide 
a full response.
As Mr B accepted my provisional  findings and as I have not received anything further from 
Oakam to counter the provisional findings then I have no reason to depart or alter from them.  
Neither party has fully explained whether the Bonus was paid out to Mr B or was put towards 
the outstanding sums.  Oakam has explained to me before the provisional  decision was 
issued that the loan statement  for 22 March 2014  shows  all the bonus rewards  [Mr B] had 
earned and collected from November 2011  to March 2014.  For the loan taken on 22 March 
2014, the total bonus reward [Mr B] collected  was £847.50. 
I can see from that statement that the Total  Rewards were £1,692.83. So, it seems to me 
that more is due to Mr B. They  cannot be ignored  in relation to the redress  calculations. 
So, I uphold  Mr Bs complaint in relation  to Loans 2 to 7 for the reasons set out in the 
provisional decision. 
what Oakam should do to put things  right
Ref: DRN04025263To put things right for Mr B, Oakam should:
refund  all the interest and charges applied as a result of Loans  2 to 7; and
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were,  to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse payment information  recorded on Mr Bs credit file as a result  of 
the interest and charges on Loans 2 to 4;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  Loans 5 to 7 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
The Bonus Rewards  Oakam has described  as being  collected will have to be accounted for 
in relation to each loan when calculating the redress due to Mr B. Those Rewards which  may 
still be due to him will also have  to be accounted for.  
HM Revenue & Customs requires Oakam to take off tax from this interest.  It must  give Mr B 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and Oakam Ltd should do as I have 
outlined above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 August 2020.

Ref: DRN04025264my provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Oakam has summarised in its submissions to us many of the OFT ILG paragraphs to which usually 
I would refer.  But I have not in this decision, as Oakam is familiar with the regulations behind 
creditworthiness assessments. 
I am aware  that several of these loans are over 12 months in length and so may not fall within the 
formal definition of high-cost short term credit. But still these are loans with high levels of cost 
attached to them and, as Oakam has already demonstrated, the irresponsible lending  guidelines 
remain applicable.  
Before lending  money  to a consumer,  a lender  should take proportionate steps to understand whether 
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things  a lender could take into account before agreeing  to lend. The key element  was 
that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things,  
including how much  was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid. And I 
add to this that once  information had been gathered by the lender, it needed  to be incorporated and 
used as part of any creditworthiness assessment. 
As Mr B did not disagree with our adjudicators  opinion then it seems that Loan 1 is not disputed, and 
I have not reviewed that loan further, but I have  kept this loan in mind when thinking about Mr Bs 
overall lending relationship  with Oakham. 
Having looked at all the evidence,  I am planning to uphold the complaint in relation to 
Loans 2 to 7. I give reasons  here. 
The credit  reports Oakam  obtained for Mr B from the beginning meant that it was aware he had an 
old, but still unsatisfied,  County Court  Judgement  and one default  on a different account. So Oakam  
was aware from the beginning that Mr B had some previous problems managing his finances.  
Oakam has said to us that To validate the income and expenditure  information  provided, we did 
obtain bank statements  on 29 July 2011, 30 November 2011, 29 June 2012,  11 July 2013, 
22 March  2014 and 14 July 2014. We also obtained payslips on 29 July 2011, 30 November 2011 and 
4 January 2013. 
Most of those same  statements have been sent to us by Mr B and I have looked  at them all. Here is a 
summary of what  I have seen, and I think its reasonable  of me to conclude that Oakams trained 
representatives saw the same. Even where a bank statement asked for at the time of an application, 
for example  - 29 July 2011  (Loan 2), may not have been available, its likely the bank statement  for 
the month before  was available. And I have looked at those too which  show similar  transactions  to 
those outlined  here.  
Ref: DRN040252651 to 29 July 2011  income  around £1,600; £600 to one on-line betting company, and cash 
withdrawals of £1,090. One payday lender loan credit of £1,000.  
1 to 30 November 2011 - income around £1,600; betting  and gaming transactions of about 
£320; cash withdrawals of £1,330 and several  credits and debits to several other payday or high cost 
lenders.   
29 June 2012  Mr Bs income  had increased to £2,140; £87 in overdraft  fees (planned  and 
unplanned); bank  interest and charges; at least two other payday or high cost lenders with several  
credits and debits from/to  them plus Oakam;  cash  withdrawals £1,000.
 11 July 2013  income had reduced to around £1,490;  about ten other payday and high-cost 
credit lenders appear on the statement and on one day - 29 July 2013  the debits to them were 
around £1,685. Cash withdrawal of £900 with some on-line betting and gaming transactions. 
Mr B has described  his gambling  as an addiction. And I can see from Mr Bs statements that the sums 
involved were not insubstantial especially as its very likely  that some,  or all, of the cash withdrawals 
were used for the same activity. As Oakam has said it was aware that gambling  can lead to 
vulnerability, and its staff had been trained to review bank statements to recognise gambling 
transactions, then I think its very likely that the sort of information outlined above  suggests that those  
staff likely would have known Mr B had a gambling  issue. 
The checks Oakam ought to have carried out were to be proportionate to several factors, including 
Mr Bs current financial situation and indications  of present or past financial difficulties, as well as 
future financial commitments. Having seen these transactions on his statements, my view is that it 
would not be unreasonable to consider that many hundreds of pounds  being spent on gambling each 
month would  be a current financial situation to be taken into account  before approving  a loan. This, 
plus the extensive use of other payday loans, revealed in Mr Bs statements  and seen by Oakam, are 
likely to be a strong indication of present financial difficulty. 
In addition, it is likely to mean that Mr B may have had an issue with repaying Oakams loans in a 
sustainable fashion within the meaning of the OFT ILG. Gambling is highly  likely  to lead to debt. And 
with a debt situation arising out of, or contributed to by, gambling then a properly carried out 
affordability assessment  was likely to lead a responsible lender to conclude that a loan was not 
affordable for an applicant in that situation.
As its likely that these statements were given  to Oakam at the time,  then I do think that the lending 
decisions from Loan  2 onwards were irresponsible and I uphold loans 2 to 4. 
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Oakams lending history with Mr B, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Oakam should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Oakam should have realised  that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 5. I say this 
because:
from Loan  5 onwards Mr B was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling  a previous 
one  often the same  day. This had been  going on for several months up to this point and 
then continued after Loan 5. So Oakam ought to have realised  it was more  likely  than not 
Mr B was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Here is part of the Loan  Table from the beginning  of this decision and it shows that for Loans 
4, 5 and 6, Mr B was effectively refinancing  around £2,000 worth of debt each time.  So, by 
March 2014 he owed much the same as he did in January  2013.
Ref: DRN04025266Loan 4 04/01/2013
£2,043.88 refinanced  to Loan 5
Loan 5 11/07/2013
£2,142.46 refinanced  to Loan 6
Loan 6 22/03/2014
£1,930.46 refinanced  to Loan 7
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Oakam.  Loan 7 was taken out 
almost three years  after his first. And although the loan was for a much larger  amount, the net 
cash received in his hand (after settling an earlier  debt) was not much more but the interest 
and indebtedness had been going on for a long time. Mr B had paid large amounts  of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Oakam over an extended period.
I think  that Mr B lost out because  Oakam  continued to provide borrowing  from Loan 5 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the sheer number of loans  and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Bs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans.
So, I am planning  to uphold the complaint about Loans 5 to 7 and Oakam should put things right.
Bonus Reward 
I have the summaries of the agreements  and the Terms and Conditions for these  type of credit 
agreements. Clause 4 in each agreement relates to the terms surrounding  the Bonus Reward  for 
each loan. Some  of Clause 4 is set out here: 
4.1 Provided  that You make 6 consecutive repayments in full and on time on your up to date account, 
You will be entitled  to a Bonus Reward  of one sixth of the sum of 6 instalments made. 4.2 Oakam will 
reserve the right to offset any outstanding Bonus Rewards against arrears  on Your  account  to help 
you repay Your loan.
These will have to be accounted for when  calculating the redress.  Oakam has explained  to me that 
the loan statement  for 22 March 2014  shows all the bonus rewards [Mr B] had earned and 
collected from November 2011 to March  2014. For the loan taken on 22 March  2014,  the total bonus 
reward [Mr B] collected was £847.50.
