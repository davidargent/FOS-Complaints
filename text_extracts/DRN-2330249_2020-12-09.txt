The complaint
Ms M complains about how TransferWise Ltd dealt with a foreign currency transaction.
What happened
Ms M tried to transfer money from her United States of American (US) account using 
TransferWise. There were a number of issues and her US bank sent TransferWise a cheque 
which it ordinarily doesnt accept. TransferWise was sent a cheque for an incorrect amount 
but instead of sending the mistake amount back it sent all of the money back. Ms M says 
she lost confidence in TransferWise and so used her bank to transfer the money but that 
meant she lost about £4,000 in exchange rate differences and would like that loss 
reimbursed.
TransferWise says a number of the problems were caused by Ms Ms US bank but accepts it 
made a mistake by sending the full amount of money back. Its offered compensation for that 
and accepts Ms M spent some trying to sort matters out but says it was her choice to use 
her bank to transfer the money and it would have honoured the exchange rate it agreed.
Ms M brought her complaint to us and our investigator thought TransferWise had dealt fairly 
with it by offering a fair and reasonable compensation amount of £250. The investigator 
thought it was Ms Ms choice to use her bank and so couldnt hold TransferWise responsible 
for any exchange rate loss.
Ms M doesnt accept that view and in summary says she had a contract with TransferWise 
that it breached. She says her US bank would only send a cheque and so she had no choice 
but to use her bank which accepted a cheque. She also disputes being told TransferWise 
would honour the agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I accept both TransferWise and the US 
bank have made mistakes here, but I am satisfied that TransferWise has made a fair and 
reasonable compensation offer. I find it would not be fair to order TransferWise to pay Ms M 
for the exchange rate loss for the reasons I will explain. I appreciate that Ms M will be 
disappointed by my decision.
There is no dispute here that the US bank made a series of mistakes which included sending 
TransferWise a cheque for an incorrect amount. I am not looking at its actions here, but I 
think its important background information. I can see that TransferWise fairly agreed to 
accept the cheque but returned the full amount rather than the overpayment.
I accept in those circumstances Ms M was caused inconvenience and distress and would 
have spent some time trying to find out what had happened and what her options were. But 
Im satisfied the compensation offer of £250 is fair and reasonable and fairly reflects that part 
of the complaint. I can see that the initial offer from TransferWise was in US Dollars, but I 
think that £250 is what I consider fair and reasonable and it may have been that is what it 
intended.
The main part of Ms Ms complaint is the exchange rate loss she then suffered. I appreciate 
why Ms M would have been concerned about using TransferWise again and I agree with her 
that TransferWise had agreed to accept a cheque and had agreed an exchange rate 
amount. But I think Ms Ms agreement was with TransferWise and that she could reasonably 
have asked it to make the transfer again, which it says it would have done at the same rate. I 
think Ms M chose to use her bank, which of course was her choice, and so it would not be 
fair or reasonable to order TransferWise to repay Ms M the difference in the two amounts. I 
also think Ms M would have known in advance of using her bank what the final payment she 
would receive was. And as it was less than the amount she would have received with 
TransferWise, could reasonably have asked TransferWise at that stage to honour the 
agreement in those circumstances.
I have listened to the telephone calls between the parties and I think during one call Ms M 
was given the option of re-trying the transfer, but I accept there was no discussion at that 
stage of the rates involved. But I would have expected Ms M, in an attempt to mitigate her 
loss, to have at least asked TransferWise to honour the original agreement. And if it had said 
it would not, then I would have reasonably concluded she would have had no choice but to 
consider other options to transfer the money.
Overall, Im satisfied that whilst TransferWise made a mistake it was Ms Ms choice to use 
her bank to transfer her money. And I have not seen any evidence that TransferWise would 
not have honoured the original agreement or accepted what would have been a second 
cheque from the US bank.
I will leave it to Ms M to decide if she wishes to accept TransferWises compensation offer.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the main part of this complaint and find TransferWise 
Ltd has made a fair and reasonable compensation offer of £250. Ms Ms acceptance of that 
offer would be in full and final settlement of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2021.
