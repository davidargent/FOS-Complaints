The complaint
Miss S complains NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua didnt update her address when she 
requested it and that it handled her complaint poorly.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss S has two credit card accounts with NewDay, and a complaint about each for NewDay 
not updating her address. This complaint is about the NewDay account branded as Aqua. 
Miss S wrote to NewDay in late 2020 asking it to update her address. NewDay responded to 
Miss S by email explaining for security reasons she would need to update her details online 
or by phone. I find NewDay acted reasonably here as updating an address is a significant 
change and so security measures must ensure the change is authorised. 
NewDays records show no further contact from Miss S until a complaint was made in 2022 
and Miss S hasnt said she made further attempts to update her address. It follows Im not 
persuaded it was wrong for NewDay not to have updated her address, and I note it has since 
been updated. 
The final response letter dated 16 February 2022 made an error in saying Miss S hadnt 
contacted NewDay to change her address when in fact she had. NewDay acknowledged this 
on Miss S other complaint and our investigator found NewDays offer of £25 compensation 
to be fair. Miss S considers NewDay should pay her £25 compensation for this complaint 
too. Im not going to require NewDay to do so for the following key reasons:
The compensation already provided by NewDay has already been considered by our 
service. This was in relation to the final response letter which only mentioned the 
other account, not the one in question.
Things dont always go smoothly. And not every mistake warrants compensation. 
Here, I dont find NewDay saying Miss S hadnt requested an address change would 
have caused her sufficient detriment to justify a compensation award.
In any case, complaint handling, which includes the content of a final response letter, 
isnt a regulated activity (or ancillary to a regulated activity). This means its not 
within my powers to make an award for any distress and inconvenience Miss S may 
have suffered as a result of the way NewDay handled her complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2022.
