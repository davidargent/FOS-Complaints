The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as M, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc
(NatWest) declined its application for a Bounce Back Loan (BBL). Ms complaint is
brought to this service by one of its directors, Mr M.
What happened
M applied to NatWest for a BBL. The application was declined, and when Mr M contacted
NatWest and asked why, one of NatWests agents told Mr M that it was because NatWest
believed one of the documents provided by M in support of its application had been edited.
Mr M wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint on Ms behalf.
NatWest looked at Ms complaint. They felt theyd processed Ms application correctly, and
so confirmed that they wouldnt be offering M a BBL. However, they acknowledged that Mr M
shouldnt have been advised that NatWest had concerns about the document they believed
may have been edited, and they apologised to M for this and made a payment of £200 as
compensation for any inconvenience incurred. Mr M wasnt satisfied with NatWests
response, so he referred Ms complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt NatWest were entitled to not offer
a BBL to M, but they didnt feel that the £200 NatWest had paid to M was fair given the
inconvenience M had incurred. As such, our investigator recommended that NatWest should
pay an additional £100 to M to further compensate it for the inconvenience it had incurred.
Mr M remained dissatisfied and felt that M had incurred reputational damage, and so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 28 November 2022 as follows:
Its clear that NatWest had concerns about a specific document supplied by M which 
caused them to decline Ms BBL application. Because NatWest dont retain 
documents when an application hasnt been successful, NatWest no longer hold a 
copy of the document as they received it at that time and so it cant be reviewed. 
However, I dont feel that it would be necessary for me to review that document even 
if it were available, and this is because Im satisfied that NatWest are entitled to hold 
the opinion that they do in regard to that document, and in regard to whether theyre 
willing to offer a BBL to M.
I can appreciate how Mr M may have strong feelings about this matter, and its to 
avoid prompting such feelings that credit providers often dont provide explanations 
as to why an application has been declined. But as per the above, Im satisfied that 
NatWest are entitled to form and hold whatever options they arrive at upon 
assessment of a credit application.
Mr M has suggested that NatWest have caused M reputational damage. But NatWest 
dont appear to have made public their concerns about the document; rather they 
appear to have held their concerns to themselves. As such, I dont feel that there has 
been any reputational damage to M. Instead, I feel that NatWest have arrived at an 
opinion as theyre entitled to do and havent shared that opinion either publicly or with 
any other businesses.
NatWest have paid £200 compensation to M because of the poor standard of service 
Mr M received when acting on Ms behalf and asking to speak to Ms BBL application 
case worker. Our investigator felt that because NatWest couldnt provide a copy of 
the document in question, so as to explain why it held the concerns it did, that 
NatWest should pay a further £100 to M in light of the uncertainty and doubt that M 
had experienced.
I dont agree with our investigators recommendation in this instance. This is because 
this complaint has been brought by M as a limited company, and a limited company 
cant experience either uncertainty or doubt. Additionally, I also feel that its 
reasonable that NatWest would no longer retain the document in question, given that 
it had no reason to do so, having declined the BBL application, but that NatWest 
would continue to maintain the opinion reached when the document was reviewed 
and assessed.
Finally, as explained, I can only reiterate that I feel that NatWest are entitled to hold
whatever opinion they arrive at regarding the document in question, and to conclude 
Ms BBL application accordingly. And I dont feel that its within the remit of this 
service to instruct NatWest, or any credit provider, to provide credit to a business 
where that credit provider has a legitimate basis for declining to do so.
All of which means that my provisional decision here will be that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action, including paying any 
further compensation to M beyond the £200 NatWest have already paid.
In response to my provisional decision, Mr M responded on Ms behalf and reiterated his 
concerns that NatWest may have caused M  and himself as one of Ms directors  
reputational damage by holding the position that one of the documents supplied to them by 
M had been edited.
I appreciate Mr Ms concerns here, but this service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law. 
As such, it isnt for me to declare that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlaw way. 
Such declarations would be for a regulatory body or Court of Law to potentially make.
 
Instead, this service is an informal dispute resolution service with a remit based on fairness 
of outcome. And with this remit in mind, I can only reiterate my own position that I feel  in 
my professional capacity as a financial ombudsman  that its fair that NatWest are entitled 
to arrive at and hold any opinion that they do in regard to the document in question.
Mr M may challenge the regulatory basis or lawfulness of NatWests position here. But, as 
explained, this would sit outside the remit of what I can consider as a financial ombudsman. 
And if Mr M maintains the legitimacy of the document in question, I can only refer Mr M back 
to NatWest to put forward Ms argument once again so that M might better understand 
NatWests continuing position and consider its own resultant position accordingly.
It also follows from my acceptance that NatWest are entitled to arrive at and hold an opinion 
regarding the document in question, that I also continue to feel that no reputational damage has occurred here. This is because I would only consider reputational damage to have 
potentially occurred if NatWest had made public their concerns about the document that M 
provided, which presently there is no evidence or suggestion of.
All of which means that it remains my position that NatWest havent acted unfairly towards M 
here, and it follows from this that my final decision will be that I wont be upholding this 
complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I trust that Mr M will understand, 
given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
