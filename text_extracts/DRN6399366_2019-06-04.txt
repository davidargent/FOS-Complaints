Our adjudicator said that QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks  before loans one and 
two but not before loan three onwards. He said that if it had done so, it would have  seen that 
Mr H couldnt afford  to repay loans three, four and five. The adjudicator  set out what 
QuickQuid should  do to put that right. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
adjudicators view and Ill explain  why.
Before agreeing to lend to Mr H, QuickQuid had to check  each time that he could afford  to 
make the repayments.  The checks it did had to be proportionate. Whats proportionate 
depends on things  like the size of the loan repayments and the information  QuickQuid  had 
about Mr H. Theres no set list of the checks a lender should  carry out. 
Before agreeing to each  of the loans,  QuickQuid asked  Mr H about his income  and 
expenditure. It also carried out credit checks. I think that the checks QuickQuid carried  out 
before loans one and two were sufficient and proportionate. There wasnt  anything  in the 
information Mr H provided or the information  QuickQuid should have been  aware  of at that 
stage which  meant that it would have been proportionate to start verifying  what  Mr H was 
saying. 
Ref: DRN63993662I think that changed from loan three onwards. Thats because  the highest  repayments for 
loans three,  four and five were  a significant  amount of Mr Hs stated income. And by loan 
three, Mr H had been borrowing from QuickQuid over several  months with very little break in 
borrowing. In those  circumstances, proportionate  checks are likely to have established  a 
much fuller  picture of his financial position.  I think proportionate checks  here wouldve meant 
that QuickQuid took steps to verify the information  Mr H provided  about  his financial 
situation.  
As QuickQuid doesnt appear to have carried out proportionate and sufficient checks, I cant  
say for sure what it wouldve found  out had it taken  steps to verify Mr Hs true situation. Mr H 
has provided us with evidence of his financial circumstances  at the time he applied  for the 
loans. So Ive been able to get a picture of what his financial  circumstances were  like. Of 
course, I accept that this isnt perfect, as different checks show different things. And just 
because something  shows up in the information Mr H has now provided, it doesnt mean that 
it wouldve  shown up in any checks that Mr H mightve carried  out. But the information  Mr H 
has provided is the best indication I have of what his financial circumstances were at the 
relevant time. In the absence  of anything else, I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Proportionate checks for loan three  onwards  would  have shown that Mr H was spending 
considerable sums on gambling and that he couldnt  afford to repay further borrowing. For 
example, at the time of loan three,  Mr H had disposable income  of around £500 but spent 
around £1,300  on gambling. The pattern was similar for loans  four and five.  
Considering everything, I dont think QuickQuid has shown its checks  for loans three 
onwards were sufficient  or proportionate.  If it had carried out proportionate checks, I think it 
wouldve seen that loans three,  four and five were unaffordable. On balance,  I dont think  
QuickQuid should  have given Mr H those loans. 
Overall, I think the adjudicators proposed  resolution of this complaint is fair and reasonable. 
I agree  with the adjudicators conclusions.  Id add that as loan five is outstanding, QuickQuid 
may apply  the refund  of interest and charges to reduce  any capital outstanding for loan five 
and pay any remaining refund to Mr H. 
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  To put things  right I require CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as 
QuickQuid:
1.To refund to Mr H all interest and charges hes paid on loans three onwards plus pay 
simple interest at the rate of 8% a year*,  from the date each sum was paid until the date 
of settlement; 
2.To write off any unpaid interest and charges on the outstanding loan;  
3.To use this refund to reduce the capital owing on the outstanding loan and pay any 
balance to Mr H; and 
4.To remove any negative information  about  loans three onwards from Mr Hs credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet  UK LLC,  trading as QuickQuid to take off 
tax from this interest. It must give Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off, if he 
asks for one.
Ref: DRN63993663Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
