The complaint
Miss E complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC didn't refund the cost of a laptop tray.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
As the price of the item Miss E wanted to claim back was less than Â£100 it wasnt 
possible for Tesco to raise a Section 75 claim. The only option available to Tesco to 
obtain a refund was a chargeback claim. 
Chargeback claims arent guaranteed and are subject to rules set by the card issuer, 
in this case Mastercard. Tesco can choose not to raise a chargeback claim if it feels 
it has no likelihood of success. 
Im satisfied Tescos decision not to raise a chargeback claim was reasonable. Tesco 
says the merchant acted in line with Miss E's instructions. The emails I've seen show 
Miss E told the merchant to proceed using the instructions and information she 
provided. 
I havent been persuaded Tesco made a mistake or treated Miss E unfairly by 
declining her request to obtain a refund under either a Section 75 or chargeback 
claim. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 June 2020.
