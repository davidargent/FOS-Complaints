K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont give him a refund  for a service he 
didnt receive.
background
Mr S booked and paid for an airport parking  space  through a booking agent  using PayPal.  
But when he tried to park his car the automatic entry system didnt recognise his vehicle  
registration number.  He said he managed to contact the parking provider who told him there 
wasnt a booking in his name  or in his registration number. So he had to pay again for his 
parking.
PayPal said the seller of the parking voucher,  the booking agent, confirmed Mr Ss booking. 
The seller  said the parking  provider confirmed the booking but it didnt have any record of 
Mr S entering the car park. So PayPal said it couldnt issue  him a refund because the seller 
would still claim for the booking. 
Our investigator wondered if Mr S had parked  in the wrong car park.  But in any event, in light 
of its user agreement, he didnt think PayPal had done anything  wrong.
Mr S wasnt  happy with this. He said he went to the right car park and when he spoke to the 
parking provider via the intercom at the barrier, he was told there wasnt a booking for him. 
So our investigator looked  at this again  and was satisfied  Mr S had given him enough 
evidence to show he went to the right car park. In conclusion he thought  the problem was 
with the parking provider. Mr S said he couldnt understand why he was told at the time there 
wasnt a booking for him. So he wants the seller to sort out the problem with the parking 
provider.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not for me to decide the merits of Mr Ss claim for a refund. My role is to look at how 
PayPal has acted towards Mr Ss claim under the terms  of its user agreement. Part of that 
agreement covers the PayPal Buyer Protection. This gives  PayPal a wide discretion when 
making a decision  about problems with the purchase of goods or services.  But it has to 
make those decisions fairly and reasonably.
Mr S paid for a service from a booking agent.  That booking  agent has told PayPal it passed 
the booking onto the parking provider who has or will charge for the service it says it 
provided. In those circumstances I can understand why PayPal declined  Mr Ss claim for a 
refund.
It seems  that the parking  provider  may be at fault here but PayPal isnt under any obligation 
to contact it to find out what  happened  with Mr Ss booking. 
I can see how strongly Mr S feels about this but for the reasons Ive given I dont think 
PayPal has done  anything wrong.
