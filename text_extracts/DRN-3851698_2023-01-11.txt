The complaint
Miss L complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC claims there is an outstanding balance due on 
her loan. Miss L also complains AvantCredits online system says the loan is repaid. 
What happened
In August 2020 the final payment due for Miss Ls loan was due. AvantCredit says the 
payment wasnt taken from Miss Ls debit card as planned. 
In the days that followed, AvantCredit contacted Miss L and asked her to make the 
outstanding payment to repay the loan. Miss L said she wanted to understand why the 
payment hadnt been processed and raised a complaint. When AvantCredit responded to 
Miss Ls complaint it initially said the card details themselves had expired. But AvantCredit 
later said the issue had been caused by changes in security measures used by the banks. 
AvantCredit says it had previously contacted Miss L to update her payment details. 
In the months that have followed, AvantCredit made a number of requests for Miss L to 
make the payment. Miss L later found AvantCredit's online facility showed her account as 
repaid. AvantCredit confirmed the loan has not been repaid in full and agreed to freeze the 
interest from September 2020. 
An investigator at this service looked at Miss Ls complaint. They thought AvantCredit had 
dealt with Miss Ls case fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Miss L asked to appeal 
and said it wasnt clear how many payments were outstanding and that shed chased 
AvantCredit for responses and information. Miss L also said AvantCredit hasnt explained 
why the payment was returned beyond mentioning technical issues. Miss L also told us 
AvantCredit has now passed the debt to a third party to collect. 
As Miss L asked to appeal her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to ensure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
I can understand why Miss L was shocked when she found the final payment due to repay 
her loan wasnt collected as planned. AvantCredit had previously collected payment 
automatically, without issue. But the final payment wasnt collected as normal. 
When AvantCredit responded to Miss Ls case it initially said her bank card had expired. But 
AvantCredit's contact notes show it emailed Miss L in November 2020 and gave her a more 
comprehensive explanation. It said that following a change in security processes in 2019 
further checks had been put in place. AvantCredit said Miss Ls bank had allowed it to 
continue collecting payments using the existing details held on file. But the final payment 
was returned by Miss Ls bank. 
I agree that the information AvantCredit could be clearer. But AvantCredit has explained that 
the final payment wasnt collected following an introduction of new security measures. And 
whilst I agree that did cause inconvenience for Miss L, Im satisfied AvantCredit has 
explained what happened to the best of its ability. 
Ive reviewed the loan agreement and account history. Im sorry to disappoint Miss L but Im 
satisfied there is an outstanding balance as the August 2020 payment wasnt made. That 
means Miss L hasnt made the full number of repayments in line with the loan agreement. 
Im satisfied AvantCredit has reasonably asked Miss L to make up the payment since the 
issue came about. 
Miss Ls told us she tried to speak with AvantCredit and chase it regarding the dispute. I can 
see a lot of contact between Miss L and AvantCredit since the issue arose. But I havent 
seen evidence of delays by AvantCredit or that it failed to contact Miss L to answer her 
questions. I understand Miss L wanted more detail, but Im satisfied AvantCredit explained 
the situation without unreasonable delays. 
I understand AvantCredit passed the debt to a third party to collect while the complaint has 
been ongoing. Im sorry to disappoint Miss L but given the length of time the payment has 
remained outstanding Im satisfied it was reasonable for AvantCredit to consider other 
methods to collect. I havent been persuaded that AvantCredit treated Miss L unfairly. 
As Im satisfied AvantCredit dealt with Miss Ls complaint fairly Im not telling it to take further 
action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ls complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2023.
