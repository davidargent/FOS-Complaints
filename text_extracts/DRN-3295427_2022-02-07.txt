The complaint
Mr J complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) has rejected the claim he made 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in relation to a solar panel 
system he says was misrepresented to him by the supplier.
Mr J is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).
Background
In or around November 2015 Mr J was contacted by a representative of a company Ill call 
P to talk about purchasing a solar panel system (the system) to be installed at his home. 
After being visited by a representative of P, Mr J decided to purchase the system and 
finance it through a 15 year fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook. The system was 
subsequently installed.
In December 2019 the CMC made a claim to Shawbrook on Mr Js behalf under section 75 
of the Act. The CMC said that, following a cold call, P had made a number of representations 
about the system that had turned out not to be true, and it was these misrepresentations that 
had induced Mr J to enter into the contract with P. The CMC said the following 
misrepresentations had been made:
the total cost of the system was documented as £10,495 to mislead Mr J, as when 
the interest was added the total cost was actually £20,185;
the system would generate free electricity;
the system would be self-funding; and
the feed in tariff (FIT) would provide enough income to cover the finance agreement 
repayments costs.
Shawbrook issued a final response and explained that it didnt agree the system had been 
misrepresented to Mr J or that there were any other reasons for the claim to be upheld. 
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that P had misrepresented 
the system to Mr J and found no reason to uphold the complaint.
The CMC didnt agree with the adjudicators view for the following reasons:
the salesman had never shown Mr J the quotation document during the sales 
meeting, and had never sent him a copy afterwards;
Mr J had never had the opportunity to read it, and it had not been part of the sales 
process in his case;
being satisfied with what he had been told in the sales meeting, Mr J had not thought 
it necessary to ask for a copy of the quotation afterwards;
other customers have reported similar sales tactics, so Mr Js claims were credible;
where a person is unaware that a representation is false, the fact that they could 
have found out it was false by taking reasonable care is not a defence in law.1

The CMC added that the system had underperformed (compared with its estimated 
performance according to P). The CMC said that it had calculated that it would take the 
system 39 years to break even.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Relevant considerations
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account; relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice; 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant 
time.
In this case the relevant law includes sections 56 and 75 of the Act.
Section 75 provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. As 
Mr J paid for the system with a fixed sum loan agreement, Shawbrook agrees that section 75 
applies to this transaction. This means that Mr J could claim against Shawbrook, the 
creditor, for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by P in the same way he could have 
claimed against P, the supplier. So, Ive taken section 75 into account when deciding what is 
fair in the circumstances of this case.
Section 56 is also relevant. This is because it says that any negotiations between Mr J and 
P, as the supplier, are deemed to have been conducted by P as an agent of Shawbrook.
For the purpose of this decision Ive used the definition of a misrepresentation as an untrue 
statement of fact or law made by one party (or his agent) to a second party which induces 
that second party to enter the contract, thereby causing them loss.
Key documents
There are several documents that have been provided by both the CMC and Shawbrook. 
These include the credit agreement and solar quote, titled Your Personal Solar Quotation. 
Ive considered these in detail and whether they support the alleged representations made 
by P.
The quote is a detailed document that sets out key information about the system, the 
expected performance, financial benefits and technical information. Im satisfied that it 
formed a central part of the sales process and is therefore relevant when considering if there 
have been any untrue statements of fact alongside Mr Js recollection of the sale.
The CMC continues to question whether the quotation document formed a central part of the 
sales process with P when Mr J agreed to enter into the contract for the system. I have 
carefully considered the points made by the representative along with those made by 
Shawbrook on behalf of P. Having done so, I remain satisfied that the quotation did form a 
central part of the sales process when Mr J agreed to enter into the contract.
The credit agreement sets out the amount being borrowed, the interest to be charged, the 
total amount payable, the term of the loan and the contractual monthly repayments.Cost of the system
The CMC has said that the cost of the system was documented as £10,495. It has said that 
this was done to mislead Mr J as this figure did not include any interest associated with the 
loan, so it hid the true cost of the system, £20,185.20.
Im satisfied that the credit agreement provided to Mr J makes it clear that the overall cost of 
the system is £20,185.20. This sets out that the cash price of the system was £10,496, the 
total amount of credit is £10,495, the total charge for credit is £9,690.20, and it goes on to 
show that the total amount payable would be £20,185.20.
As the quote provided by P is clear that there would be a monthly loan repayment due, as 
set out in the table below, Im satisfied that the two documents, the quote and the credit 
agreement, made it clear that although the cash price of the system was £10,495, it would 
cost Mr J more than this as he had decided to pay for it with an interest bearing loan.
FIT payments
Mr J has alleged that he was told his monthly loan repayments would be covered, or self-
funded by the FIT payments. Ive considered the quote that was provided by P and 
considered whether this supports what Mr J has said.
The system analysis page of the quote sets out the estimated income Mr J could expect to 
receive by way of FIT payments from the system. This is split out into the expected FIT 
payments in the first year and the expected average income over 20 years. The FIT scheme 
only provides payments for a 20-year period.
I think that the first of these tables is clear that Mr J could expect to receive a total FIT 
income in year one of £477.18.
The quote goes on to look at the electricity savings Mr J could expect from the system. The 
expected year one electricity savings is £374.10 and, when taking into account the optional 
extras chosen by Mr J, the combined income and savings in year one is shown as 
£1,148.83. This is shown in a table titled Putting it all together.
Theres a section headed Repayments with three tables showing repayments over 60 
months, 120 months and 180 months. Ive focused on the table for 180 months as this is the 
length of the loan that Mr J entered into with Shawbrook. This table shows the loan as 
repayable in 180 monthly payments of £112.14. For each year of the 15 year loan it shows 
the expected grand total return from the system. It then averages that figure over 12 months, 
and subtracts the monthly loan repayment of £112.14, to give an average difference 
between the monthly return from the system and the monthly loan repayment in each year. 
The figures for the first three years are negative.
I think the quote clearly sets out the income Mr J could expect to receive from the system, by 
way of FIT payments, as well as his expected contractual monthly loan repayments. Whilst 
I accept that the table doesnt simply compare the FIT income to the monthly loan 
repayments, it does clearly set out that the overall income he could expect to receive by way 
of FIT income and any additional savings would not be immediately sufficient to cover the 
monthly loan repayments. Therefore, Im not satisfied that he was told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT income alone.
Self-funding
Ill now consider whether P told Mr J that the system would self-funding.
Ive considered the table above which sets out the estimated average monthly income from 
the system, and the effect on that income of subtracting the monthly loan repayment. Im 
satisfied that the table is clear and easy to understand. That section of the quote has been 
signed by Mr J, and he has not disputed that this is his signature, so Im satisfied that it was 
shown to him.
Im of the view that this makes it clear that the system wouldnt be self-funding from the start. 
I think the quote is clear that there would be a difference between the expected income and 
monthly loan repayments.
However, I do accept that Mr J was told by P that the system would be self-funding over a 
period of time.
The Key Facts page of the quote (page 2) has a graph detailing the performance over 20 
years. This shows that by year 8 the overall benefits that Mr J could expect to receive would 
have exceeded the cash price of the system.
A later page of the quote has a table detailing the performance of the system over 20 years. 
This shows that by the end of year 13 the overall benefits that Mr J could expect to receive 
would have exceeded the total amount payable under the loan agreement.
As Ive set out above, Im satisfied that P told Mr J that the system would pay for itself by 
year 8, and for the finance by year 13, as supported by the table above. If that were an 
untrue statement of fact, and Im satisfied that this was what induced him to enter into the 
contract, and he subsequently suffered a loss, that would amount to a misrepresentation.
Performance
Ive gone on to consider the performance of the system and whether this is in line with the 
contract between P and Mr J. The MCS certificate and quote sets out that the system is 
expected to produce 3,203 kWh a year.
I have looked at Mr Js FIT statements and can see that his system, on average, has 
generated 3,267 kWh a year. This is slightly more than estimated by P at the point of sale, 
so Im satisfied that the system is performing as expected.
I have also looked at the assumptions used by P, including the self-consumption rate, 
expected annual increase in utility prices (EPR) and expected annual RPI inflation increase. 
I am satisfied that Ps method for calculating these are fair and reasonable.
P used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data between 2005 and 2014 to calculate the 
utility price and RPI inflation. I have looked at the actual yearly increases between 2016 and 
2020, and the increases have been lower than predicted by P at the point of sale, and I think 
this explains why Mr J perhaps hasnt been receiving the financial returns he may have been 
expecting from the solar panels. Since actual energy prices have been lower than the 
modelling predicted, the savings achieved through the energy generated by the system has 
been correspondingly lower.
As I have explained, the assumptions used by P were based on the information available 
from the ONS at the time. And based on this, I dont consider it unreasonable for P to have 
used them as the basis for calculating the potential financial income Mr J could have 
expected to receive from the system. So, whilst I can appreciate that the returns may not 
have been as high as estimated at the point of sale, Im not persuaded that this was due to 
unreasonable assumptions being used by P at the time Mr J entered into the contract.
Summary
Having carefully considered the evidence provided by all parties in this complaint, Im
satisfied that there were no untrue statements of fact made by P that induced Mr J to enter 
into the contract for the system, and I have found no other reason to uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 March 2022.
