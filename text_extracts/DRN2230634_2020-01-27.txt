K820x#14complaint
Mr P has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA is pursuing  him for a debt. He doesnt 
believe he should pay this as he was a victim  of fraud.
background
Mr P was selling a camera on an online marketplace. A customer  paid Â£796 and Mr P sent it 
to the address they requested. He then found out the person  who he thought  had bought the 
camera hadnt. Their  own PayPal account had been used along with their credit card to pay 
for something theyd  not authorised. PayPal received a chargeback request which  they had 
no choice but to repay. Mr Ps own PayPal account  ended up with a negative  balance which 
PayPal was asking  Mr P to repay.
Mr P brought his complaint to the ombudsman  service.
Our investigator didnt  think PayPal  had done anything wrong. Both parties  had been  a 
victim of a fraudster. But as Mr P had sent the camera to an address other than the one on 
the original instruction, he was no longer covered  by PayPals protection for sellers. Our 
investigator also didnt  think there  was evidence PayPal  had been  unfair  in asking Mr P to 
repay what was owed.
Mr P disagreed with this outcome.  Hes asked an ombudsman to consider his complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
conclusion and for similar reasons. Ill explain why. 
The facts  of this complaint  arent  really in dispute.  Mr P sent his camera to a different 
address than the one on the original  instruction.  He didnt see anything wrong in doing so 
after an approach  from the person he thought was the buyer  giving an alternative address.  
In fact someone had misused the buyers account and their credit  card.  Theyd not 
authorised this purchase. On this basis PayPal had no choice but to repay the money which 
had never  been  authorised. I dont think Mr P disagrees with this either  as he sees they were  
both victims of this fraud.
However Mr P doesnt understand why he didnt get the same sort of protection  as afforded  
to the buyer. Ive reviewed PayPals User Agreement.  Our investigator quoted the relevant 
section of eligibility for seller protection in his view of 15 July 2019. This states  there is no 
seller protection  given  when the item is posted to a different address, including at the 
request of the [supposed] buyer. I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly here so Ive no basis  
for asking  them to refund Mr P.
I know Mr P is upset  about how hes been asked to repay the debt. This has now been 
hanging over him for over a year and a half. Like our investigator  I can only see two emails  
sent by PayPal asking this amount to be repaid.  I suspect the most likely thing to have 
happened is that PayPal has sold on his debt to debt collectors. They  will also most likely be 
regulated and have to meet certain standards when asking for a debt to be repaid. I dont  
Ref: DRN22306342know who that business is but Mr P may well be able to complain against them  directly  for 
their actions. I cant see Mr P has done this.
Both Mr P and the person  whose account  was misused are victims of fraud. One of them  got 
refunded whilst the other lost out. Mr P has neither his camera nor the money.  I absolutely  
appreciate how this outcome must seem unfair  to him. But unfortunately I cant ask PayPal 
to refund him.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Mr Ps complaint against 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 February  2020.
