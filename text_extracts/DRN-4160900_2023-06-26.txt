The complaint
Miss C complained because National Westminster Bank Plc debited £3,100.14 from her 
current account to pay her credit card.
What happened
Miss C opened a NatWest credit card in August 2016. By September 2019 the balance was 
£3,100.14. NatWest sent payment reminders as well as statements. Miss C had made some 
small payments, but hadnt made the minimum monthly payment for many months. The 
statements all said If you are unable to pay the minimum payment or are in financial 
difficulty, please contact us on [number] but Miss C didnt contact NatWest.
NatWest sent a default notice to Miss Cs registered address, which requested full 
repayment or realistic repayment proposals, and said that if Miss C didnt comply, a default 
notice might be issued. 
The credit card defaulted on 13 September 2019. NatWest also notified debt collectors who 
tried unsuccessfully to recover the £3,100.14 balance outstanding from Miss C.
On 24 August 2022, NatWest wrote to Miss Cs registered address, saying it was extremely 
important that she contacted NatWest immediately to discuss repayment options. The letter 
said: The Bank may use its legal right of set off to clear outstanding arrears or excesses by 
transferring funds from other Bank accounts with credit balances held in your name.  It went 
on to say that if Miss C couldnt make payment or proposals for payment, it recommended 
that she should seek advice, and gave her details of where to obtain free money advice.
No arrangement to pay was made. Following this letter, on 22 September 2022, NatWest 
made a partial payment of £2,100.14 from another account in Miss Cs name. 
NatWest sent another letter, identical to the 24 August letter, on 14 February. Miss C didnt 
make proposals for payment, so on 10 March NatWest transferred a final payment of £1,000 
from Miss Cs other account to her credit card. NatWest wrote to Miss C that day to confirm 
the final payment and to say that the balance on her card was now repaid and her card 
account closed.
Miss C complained. She said that:
- shed been misadvised that the credit card was at 0% interest when shed opened it 
in 2016;
- she was unhappy that her credit card had been cleared by transferring money from 
her other accounts.
NatWest replied on 15 March, saying that:
- Miss Cs credit card had been opened in 2016, which was more than six years 
earlier. Shed also had updates on her account, and could have raised concerns 
within a reasonable timescale. It told her that she could contact this service, but 
explained that it thought Miss C had complained outside the time limits which would 
mean we wouldnt be able to consider this part of her complaint;
- The bank was able to clear the balance on Miss Cs credit card using the bank 
account she held, and this was in line with the terms and conditions. It said that it had 
followed the correct process.
Miss C said shed had to incur costs through phoning NatWest, and NatWest paid her £10 
for this, but didnt change its mind about the outcome.
Miss C wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. She said shed opened the credit 
card in 2016 and it was supposed to be 0% interest. She said she wasnt being charged any 
interest on the credit card, and for some reason the card was closed but she hadnt been 
told why. She also said she hadnt been notified about the money being taken out of her 
other account. Miss C said she wanted the money returned, and to come to an agreement 
that it could be paid in instalments, and she wanted compensation from NatWest for the 
distress and inconvenience it had caused her.
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint. He said that NatWest had provided 
evidence which showed that Miss C had been notified on multiple occasions about the debt 
she owed. It had used debt collectors and sent letters, and had acted in line with the terms 
and conditions when it transferred the money to her credit card.
Miss C didnt agree. She sent us multiple emails. In summary, she said that shed always 
reviewed her account on the NatWest app. She said shed cut up the credit card and 
returned it to NatWest. She said NatWest had hacked into her NatWest bank account and 
had no right to enter an account without her permission, which she would have refused. She 
said NatWest shouldnt have given her details to the debt collection agents who had 
contacted her. She said her complaint should be upheld because NatWest had gone behind 
a customers back. She also said the agreement, made over the phone in 2016, was £2,100 
not the £3,100.14 which NatWest had said, and she wanted this refunded plus interest and 
compensation.
Miss Cs complaint was passed to me for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive set out above, Miss C has raised multiple points in her submissions to this service. 
Ive understood all of those and considered all shes said and sent us, but in reaching my 
decision here Ive focused on what I think is vital to my conclusions.
Preliminary point  opening of the credit card
Ill deal first with a preliminary point. Miss C mentioned in her complaint that the credit card 
interest rate was 0%, agreed by phone when she opened the account in 2016. This service 
is governed by rules which are set out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Among 
other things, these rules say when we can and cant consider a complaint. Some of these 
rules are about timescales.
The relevant FCA rule here is called DISP Section 2.8.2 R and it says:
The Ombudsman cannot consider a complaint if the complainant refers it to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service:

(2) more than:
(a) six years after the event complained of; or (if later)(b) three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably 
to have become aware) that he had cause for complaint.
Miss C opened her credit card in 2016, and brought her complaint to us in March 2023. That 
was more than six years later. Shed had access to statements, so she ought reasonably to 
have become aware that she had cause for complaint straightaway. The rules also provide 
for an exemption if the ombudsman is satisfied that the failure to comply with the time limits 
was the result of exceptional circumstances. This means truly exceptional  for example 
when a customer is sadly incapacitated in hospital for the whole period. Ive seen nothing 
that suggests exceptional circumstances applied here. 
So I find that this service doesnt have the jurisdiction to consider the part of Miss Cs 
complaint which relates to when she opened the credit card in 2016.
Complaint about NatWest transferring money from Miss Cs other NatWest account to her 
credit card in 2022 and 2023
This is the main point at issue in Miss Cs complaint.
The Right of set-off is a legal principle under which a bank transfers money from an 
account in credit, to repay or reduce a debt on another account held by the same customer. 
Its often included in the terms and conditions, and I have checked NatWests terms and 
conditions, to which Miss C would have had to agree in order for the account to be opened. 
Section 7.10 says:
7.10 Using money in your account to repay money you owe us
If youve borrowed money from us (for example, through a loan, credit card or overdraft) and 
the money or the repayments are overdue for payment, we may take money from your 
account to repay some or all of the money you owe us (including any fees or interest). This 
is called set off. 
So NatWest had the right to transfer money from Miss Cs other account, to her credit card 
debt. Miss C claims that NatWest hacked into her other account, but that isnt the situation 
here. Miss Cs other account was with NatWest as her bank, and NatWest had the legal right 
of set-off. Miss C had had the use of the money, and NatWest was entitled to have it repaid. 
It was entitled to transfer money from her other account to pay off the debt on her credit 
card.
When Miss C contacted this service, she said that she couldnt buy food or pay bills, so Ive 
also considered whether NatWest did enough to provide help for Miss C. I cant see any 
record of Miss C having contacted NatWest to say she was having financial difficulties, 
despite the fact that her monthly statements gave a phone number to talk about any financial 
difficulties. NatWest also provided Miss C with information about where to get free money 
advice, in both its August 2022 and February 2023 letters. I cant see that NatWest could 
have done more, when theres no evidence that Miss C either responded to any of these 
invitations, or informed NatWest about her situation. 
To deal with Miss Cs other points, Ive looked at the details of what happened here. Ive 
seen Miss Cs credit card statements, which show that the balance which she C owed in 
September 2019 was £3,100.14, not the £2,100 which she says it was. It had also been 
around that figure for many months. Ive seen nothing to indicate that Miss C couldnt have 
accessed her account information, and it doesnt make any difference that shes said she 
accessed her account using the app. The balance had been around this level for a 
considerable time, and if Miss C disagreed with the balance, Id have expected her to have 
disputed this at a much earlier stage.Ive also looked at the correspondence which NatWest sent to Miss Cs address, in advance 
of the default on her credit card, and before and after it transferred the funds across. These 
formal letters were sent to Miss Cs registered address, which was also the address she 
gave this service when she contacted us. As Ive set out above, there were multiple letters, 
and I find it unlikely that Miss C didnt receive any of them. However, in any event what 
counts is whether or not NatWest sent them, not whether Miss C received them. I accept 
from the evidence before me that NatWest sent the letters. If for some postal reason, the 
letters never reached her, thats not something for which NatWest was liable. 
So I find that NatWest did contact Miss C multiple times about the situation, and it offered 
contact to help discuss a repayment plan, and details of debt charities. NatWest also sent 
letters before both transfers under the right of set-off, and also after the debt had been paid 
off and the account finally closed. So NatWest followed the correct procedures.
Finally, Miss C objected to NatWest passing her details to the debt collection agencies. 
NatWest had a right to do this, too. The terms and conditions, to which Miss C would have 
had to agree in order for the account to be opened, include: 
14.7 We will not share your information with anyone outside NatWest except:

g) with credit reference agencies and with third parties in relation to debt collection and 
related activities.
This means that NatWest was entitled to share Miss Cs information with the debt collection 
agencies which contacted her.
I find that NatWest acted in line with the legal principle of set-off, and the terms and 
conditions of the account, when it transferred £3,100.14 from Miss Cs other NatWest 
account to pay off the outstanding debt on her credit card. It had also offered her multiple 
opportunities to get in touch about her situation and / or a payment arrangement, to pay the 
money she owed. So I dont require NatWest to refund Miss C, or to pay her interest or 
compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 July 2023.
