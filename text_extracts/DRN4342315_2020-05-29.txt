In our most recent review of this case our adjudicator upheld  Mrs Ms complaint about 
loans 8 onwards  and thought these loans shouldnt have been given. Sunny havent 
responded, so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN43423152the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Sunny says it carried out income and expenditure checks before agreeing  to lend Mrs M any 
loans, and I think this was proportionate for loans 1  4. But, by loan 5 I think Sunny 
shouldve carried out a more thorough review of her circumstances before agreeing to lend 
to her. Ive looked at the information Sunny collected, and we also asked Mrs M to supply 
further information and evidence about  her circumstances at the time. However, based on all 
the evidence Ive seen Im not persuaded that Mrs M was suffering  from financial difficulty 
which Sunny  shouldve been  aware of at the time. So, I dont think loans  1  7 should be 
upheld.    
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ms case,  I think  that this point was reached  by 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs M had taken out eight loans within three  months and the 
amounts borrowed  were not significantly and consistently decreasing over this time. 
So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mrs M was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Mrs Ms indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Ms first loan was for £100 and loan 8 was for £400.  At this point Sunny ought  to 
have known that Mrs M was not likely borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Ref: DRN43423153Mrs M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  51 was 
taken out almost two years after Mrs Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. So, 
Mrs M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny  over 
an extended period.
I think that Mrs M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ms ability  to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans  8 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 8 - 51 should be removed from 
Mrs Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Mrs M has been in an IVA. So, she may have to give some  or all of her compensation to her 
insolvency practitioner. Mrs M should keep this in mind  she may need to speak to the 
practitioner about any compensation she gets.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mrs M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 June  2020.
