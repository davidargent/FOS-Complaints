The complaint
Miss B complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCAs (PayPal) decision to decline 
her claim for a refund. 
What happened
Miss B bought mobile phones from a seller and used her PayPal account to send a payment 
of £380. Miss B then filed a claim with PayPal on the basis the phones were Significantly 
Not As Described. PayPal explained to Miss B she was entitled to a full refund provided she 
returned the phones to the seller in the same condition theyd been received. PayPal 
provided the address for Miss B to return the phones. Miss B though had already returned 
the phones to a different address to the one provided by PayPal. PayPal said Miss B didnt 
return the phones to the address they provided and the tracking number provided by Miss B 
wasnt valid, so they declined her claim. Miss B complained to PayPal and they upheld their 
decision to decline her claim.  
Our investigator looked into things for Miss B. He thought PayPal hadnt acted fairly in 
declining Miss Bs claim and recommended they refund her the £380 she paid. PayPal 
disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. And, I think the investigators 
recommendation here is a fair way to resolve matters. 
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
claim. 
The PayPal Buyer Protection policy sets out the eligibility requirements and steps a buyer 
must take in order to claim a refund. This says a buyer must Comply with PayPals shipping 
requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal 
may require you to, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a 
third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery. 
Ive also seen an email sent by PayPal to Miss B which explains the seller has agreed to 
issue a full refund once the phones are returned. This email also sets out the address to 
return the phones.  
Its not in dispute that Miss B returned the phones to an address which was different to the 
address provided by PayPal. Taking into account the email sent by PayPal, I agree Miss B 
hasnt acted in line with their request to return the phones to the specified address. While 
this is the case, Ive gone further to consider whether PayPal have acted fairly and 
reasonably in the circumstances of this case. 
The PayPal Buyer Protection policy encourages a buyer to try to resolve the dispute directly 
with the seller before raising a claim. Examples of this in the policy are, PayPal say a buyer 
should Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim and 
there being a time period of 180 days from making payment to open a dispute because This 
might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the 
transaction that may help resolve the dispute. This is precisely what Miss B did and I can 
see she was in direct communication with the seller to arrange the return of the phones prior 
to raising a claim with PayPal. The communication shows Miss B received a label from the 
seller with the address for the phones to be returned  and the Certificate of Posting and 
receipt provided by Miss B shows this is where the phones were returned. The information 
Ive seen shows Miss B returned the phones a few days before she received the email from 
PayPal setting out the address the phones should be returned to. So, Im persuaded Miss B 
did act in line with the PayPal Buyer Protection policy by attempting to resolve the dispute 
directly with the seller. And, she didnt ignore PayPals request to send the phones to their 
specified address, but rather, she acted in good faith and in the spirit of the PayPal Buyer 
Protection policy, by trying to resolve the dispute by sending the phones to the address 
provided by the seller.   
I can see PayPal disagree with our investigators view and point out Miss B hasnt complied 
with her obligations under the User Agreement. But, in the circumstances of this case, I dont 
think its fair and reasonable to apply the narrow lens of the User Agreement alone. I say this 
because Ive seen clear evidence which I believe shows, on the balance of probabilities, that 
Miss B has returned the phones. PayPal say Miss B didnt comply with their request to return 
the phones to the address specified by them. I do acknowledge this, but Ive explained 
above why I dont think its fair for this to be grounds to decline Miss Bs claim. I note PayPal 
say Miss B chose to return the phones before they had an opportunity to provide the address 
but, given the PayPal Buyer Protection policy actively encourages direct communication and 
resolution between buyer and seller, I dont think it was unreasonable for Miss B to arrange 
shipment without waiting to hear back from PayPal.   
PayPal say their complaint policies make it clear they must be able to verify that an item has 
been successfully returned to a seller. And, in this case, the tracking number showing on the 
receipt appears invalid so theres no way to verify the status of the delivery. I understand 
why PayPal require this information but the evidence Ive seen persuades me its the phones 
which have been returned. Firstly, the contemporaneous evidence of the messages between 
Miss B and the seller refers specifically to the phones. And, the timeline of events which 
occur are consistent with Miss Bs account of events. The evidence shows Miss B asks for 
details of where to return the phones and a few days later the seller provides a return label. 
Miss B then returns the phones a few days later using the returns label and, from the weight 
of the package shown on the receipt, I believe its more likely than not the package 
contained the phones. I note the tracking reference doesnt show any results, but I can see 
Miss B has taken all the steps agreed with the seller and I havent been provided with any 
evidence to show the phones havent been delivered.    
I understand PayPal say Miss B didnt respond to their requests for information in a timely 
manner which is why her claim was originally closed. Miss B then appealed the decision and 
provided information which PayPal say showed the return address was different to the one 
they provided. So, I dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal to close Miss Bs claim 
originally as she didnt provide the information requested. But, on appeal, she did provide the 
information so I dont believe Miss B not originally responding in a timely manner should be a 
reason to decline the claim thereafter. As mentioned above, I dont dispute Miss B hasnt used the address provided by PayPal and 
I dont disagree she hasnt therefore acted completely in line with the relevant policy. But, Im 
persuaded she has acted in the spirit of the PayPal Buyer Protection policy by corresponding 
with the seller direct and acted in good faith by sending the phones to the address they 
provided. And, in doing so, she has attempted to resolve the problem directly with the seller 
before filing a claim  which is in line with the PayPal Buyer Protection policy. So, I think 
PayPal have acted unfairly in declining the claim for £380.   
Putting things right
Ive taken the view that PayPal have acted unfairly in declining Miss Bs claim. So, PayPal 
should refund the £380 payment to Miss B for this transaction. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must 
refund £380 to Miss B. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
