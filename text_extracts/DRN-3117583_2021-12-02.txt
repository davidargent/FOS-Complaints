The complaint
Ms Zs complained about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) dealt with her 
request for a refund when a phone shed bought developed a fault.
What happened
Towards the end of 2020, Ms Z bought a mobile phone via an online shopping site.  She 
paid £399 for the phone via PayPal.  A few days later, Ms Z contacted the seller because 
she was having problems with the phones battery.  The seller gave her a partial refund of 
£50.
Five or six weeks later, Ms Z contacted the seller to get the remaining £349 refunded to her.  
She said the phone wasnt working properly as the touch screen was unresponsive.  The 
seller refused to refund her, so Ms Z raised a dispute using PayPals buyer protection.  
PayPal told Ms Z that shed have to return the phone to the seller and provide them with 
proof shed done that.  
Ms Z provided what PayPal had requested.  PayPal told her they were investigating.  
Several weeks later, PayPal closed the request without giving Ms Z a refund.  And they 
limited access to her account.
Ms Z complained to PayPal about the account limitation and about how her refund request 
had been dealt with.  She said the seller had said theyd not received the phone, just an 
empty box.  But she said the weight of the parcel proved that wasnt true.  PayPal 
considered her complaint but didnt change how theyd dealt with Ms Z.  So she brought her 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator considered it and concluded PayPal didnt need to do anything differently to 
resolve Ms Zs complaint.  She explained shed reviewed PayPals terms and noted that 
customers could only take advantage of buyer protection if their account was in good 
standing.  And Ms Zs account wasnt, because of her high dispute rate.  She also noted that 
the seller had told PayPal hed received an empty box rather than the phone  which also 
caused concern.
Ms Z didnt agree with the investigators view.  She said shed followed PayPals instructions 
about returning the phone so she should be entitled to a refund.  
Because Ms Z didnt accept what the investigator said, Ive been asked to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Im not upholding Ms Zs complaint.  Ill explain why.
I understand why Ms Zs upset  and why she wants PayPal to refund what she paid for the 
phone.  But I can only decide they should do that if Im satisfied that theyve done something 
which they need to put right.
Ms Z tried to get a refund using PayPals Buyer Protection.  PayPals website says this:
covers them [buyers] in case there is a problem.  If an item doesnt arrive, or is 
significantly not as described, we will help buyers get a full refund.
To qualify for Buyer Protection, PayPals user agreement says a buyers account must be in 
good standing.  And they must provide information to PayPal when asked and comply with 
shipping requests.  Ms Z says she did as PayPal instructed and returned the phone to the 
seller.  The seller told PayPal he received the phones box, but not the phone itself.
I cant decide whether or not the seller received the phone.  But I can see PayPal received 
the same contradictory information from the parties.  This prompted them to investigate the 
parties accounts.  And that showed them Ms Zs account wasnt in good standing, because 
she had a high dispute ratio.  
And, on that basis, Ms Z wasnt eligible for Buyer Protection.  So it was reasonable for 
PayPal to decline her request for a refund.
Ive seen Ms Zs comments on the investigators view.  Shes unhappy that PayPal only 
rejected her dispute after shed returned the phone.  She said that, if PayPal had rejected it 
in the first place, she could have kept the phone and not been without both a phone and her 
money.
Ive thought about this.  I understand Ms Zs position.  But its not my role to look at PayPals 
business processes.  Rather, Ive considered whether theyve followed those processes in 
Ms Zs case.
Ive read the Buyer Protection information on PayPals website.  Its a condition of using 
Buyer Protection that buyers comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner. 
 including returning the item to the seller if PayPal tell them to.  Im satisfied from this that 
Ms Z wouldnt have received a refund without returning the item  which was what she 
wanted.   
And I cant say PayPal should have rejected Ms Zs dispute earlier.  They didnt have the 
information to do that until they investigated her account following the seller reporting hed 
received an empty box.  So I dont think PayPal have been unfair here.  And I dont think 
they need to do anything differently to resolve Ms Zs complaint.    
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Ms Zs complaint about PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2022.
