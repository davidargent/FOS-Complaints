Complaint
Mr B complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called Gain Credit 
LLC, trading at the time as Lending Stream. Mr B says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to LS throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Mr B took out 12 instalment loans from LS between November 2017 and 
December 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Bs borrowing with LS, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan number 5 onwards. LS disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans final 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mr Bs 
complaint.
LS needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr B could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment 
amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
LS should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, LS was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, a loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr B could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
LS told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to Mr B 
including assessing his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that at the time all 
this information showed that he would be able to make the loan repayments he was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which LS should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, LS should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans to Mr B. 
Ive taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans 1  4 in this case. And I dont think its clear enough 
that what LS would have seen, from its checks, suggested loans 1  4 were either 
unaffordable for Mr B or that the information from the checks it carried out undermined the 
income or outgoings Mr B had himself declared. 
I accept that Mr B may have already been finding managing his money quite difficult at this 
point. However, theres no clear record that the type or depth of credit checks carried out at 
that time would have exposed these issues. So Im afraid I dont agree that LS knew its 
lending was unsustainable for loans 1 - 4. I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 5, the situation was different and LS should 
have been considering whether further lending was appropriate. Thats because by the point 
of being granted loan 5 Mr B still had outstanding balances with 3 previous LS loans hed 
taken out (loan numbers 2, 3 and 4) which I think shows there was an obvious financial risk 
emerging. Mr B was therefore building up debt and also having to pay increasing amounts 
back each month to service it. 
Our experience of short-term lending tells us that consumers who have difficulty managing 
their money in this way are less likely to be able to sustainably repay a loan. With this 
information, I dont think LS ought to have lent him the money for loan 5. I dont think it was 
responsible to do so.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 6 onwards, there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident in my view. By no, he had 4 previous loans outstanding 
and hed being borrowing consistently, without a meaningful break, for over 9 months. There 
was an obvious dependency on high-interest, short-term lending evidenced by this. So Im 
also upholding Mr Bs complaint in respect of loans 6 -12 as LS repeatedly lent to Mr B in an 
unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; 
andthe length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
 
Putting things right
In order to put things right for Mr B, LS should
refund all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 -12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Bs credit file in relation to loan 5.
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 - 12 should be completely 
removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires LS to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr B a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct Gain Credit LLC to put things right as set out 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
