The complaint
Mr M complains about issues relating to a car that was supplied to him under a conditional 
sale agreement with Moneybarn Limited.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
he electronically signed in March 2020. He complained to Moneybarn nine days later that he 
hadnt received the V5 registration document for the car, the SD card was missing from the 
satnav and the car only had ten months left on its MOT certificate but had been sold with a 
full MOT.
Moneybarn said that it would arrange for a replacement SD card and registration document 
to be supplied but that the car hadnt been advertised as having a full MOT. In June 2020, 
whilst he was waiting for the replacement SD card and registration document, Mr M 
complained about other issues with the car, including the DAB radio not working, the low tyre 
pressure warning on the dashboard being lit and the brake light being on even though the 
brakes were working. He said that he wanted to reject the car.
The dealer offered to cover the cost of a new SD card up to the value of £50 and 
recommended that Mr M take the car to a specified retailer  but he didnt do so. Moneybarn 
arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in September 2020. The 
inspection report said that the car had been of satisfactory quality at the point of sale and 
that the faults were electrical and could have occurred at any time since the finance was 
incepted. Moneybarn didnt uphold his complaint so Mr M complained to this service. Hes 
provided an estimate dated June 2021 for £870 for a replacement EGR (exhaust gas 
recirculation) valve.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that he was any worse off because there was 10 months instead of 12 months on the cars 
MOT and she thought that Moneybarn had acted fairly and reasonably in connection with the 
registration document and SD card. She thought that the car was of satisfactory quality when 
it was supplied to Mr M and she didnt think that Moneybarn was unreasonable in not 
offering to repair the issues about which hed complained. She said that Mr M had only made 
one monthly payment to Moneybarn but had continued to use the car which she didnt think 
was fair.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
hes never been in a position to pay for the SD card up front;
he sorted out the registration document by contacting the DVLA;
the independent expert didnt test drive the car and he had to use it to get to work;
all of the issues occurred during the first week of having the car and a car with this 
kind of relatively low mileage should not get any of these problems, especially not an 
EGR valve problem;
he feels that hes been totally ignored by Moneybarn as this could have been rectified 
within the first weeks but hes had to borrow money from family to get a car so that 
he can get to work and hes gone bankrupt; and
the car hasnt been used for over a year so Moneybarn should either pay for the 
repairs or collect the car from the garage its at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr M was about eight years old, had been driven for 
56,970 miles and had a price of £6,098;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr M complained to Moneybarn about three issues in March 2020  the MOT 
certificate, the SD card and the registration document; 
he says that he was told that the car had a full MOT certificate but Ive seen no other 
evidence to show that Mr M was told that the car would be supplied to him with a 
twelve month MOT certificate  the car had passed an MOT test in January 2020, I 
dont consider it to be likely that he would have been told that it had passed an MOT 
test in March 2020 and MOT test information is publicly available  so Im not 
persuaded that Moneybarn has acted incorrectly in connection with the cars MOT 
certificate;
the car was missing the SD card required for the satnav and Moneybarn said that it 
would be replaced  there was a delay in that happening and the dealer said that it 
would cover the cost of a new SD card up to the value of £50 and recommended that 
Mr M take the car to a specified retailer  I consider that to have been a fair and 
reasonable response to the missing SD card;
Mr M says that hes never been in a position to pay for the SD card up front but hes 
only made one monthly payments to Moneybarn and Im not persuaded that it would 
be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any further action about the missing 
SD card;
Moneybarn said that it would replace the registration document but there was a delay 
in that happening (but that was at the time of the government imposed restrictions in 
response to the pandemic and Im not persuaded that Mr M has suffered a loss as a 
result of the delay in the document being supplied to him) - he says that he sorted out 
the registration document himself so I dont consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to take any further action about the 
registration document; 
Mr M complained to Moneybarn in June 2020 about other issues with the car and he 
says that all of the issues occurred during the first week of having the car  but he didnt refer to those issues when he complained to Moneybarn in March 2020 so I 
dont consider it to be likely that those issues were present at that time;
Moneybarn arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert  the 
inspection took place in September 2020 and the cars mileage at that time was 
recorded as 62,492  so Mr M had been able to drive the car for more than 5,500 
miles between March and September 2020;
Mr M says that the independent expert didnt test drive the car but I consider that its 
reasonable for the expert to conclude what needs to be done to investigate the 
issues referred to it  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the independent expert acted incorrectly in these circumstances;
the experts report said: We would conclude that the faults could be confirmed. The 
tyre pressure monitoring system warning light was illuminated, the high level brake 
light was flickering and dull and the DAB radio did not function correctly, all of which 
we considered to be electrical faults, which may have occurred at any point and 
would not be considered the responsibility of the selling agent;
I sympathise with Mr M for those issues, and the issue with the EGR valve, but I dont 
consider it to be likely that those issues were present when the car was supplied to 
him or that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality at that time;
Mr M says that the cars mileage in July 2021 was 64,141 and he says that hes got 
another car and hasnt used this car for more than a year  but hes only made one 
monthly payment under the agreement to Moneybarn;
I sympathise with Mr M for the financial difficulties that hes described but I dont 
consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to allow 
Mr M to reject the car or to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint; and
I suggest that Mr M contacts Moneybarn about the arrears on his account and the 
future monthly payments  he should explain his financial difficulties to it and try to 
agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount that he owes to it  its 
required to respond to his financial difficulties positively and sympathetically. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
