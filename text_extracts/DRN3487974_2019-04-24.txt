K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that the money  he sent abroad to his wife never reached her account.  Hes 
also unhappy with the time it took for National Westminster Bank Plc to locate and pay the 
funds back into his account. 
background
On 23 May 2018 Mr H wanted to make a large payment to his wife who was abroad at the 
time. This money was for an intended house purchase overseas. He went into a NatWest  
branch and asked  the cashier  to complete  the transaction on his behalf. He said he gave the 
cashier his wifes bank  account details. But, while the transaction left Mr Hs account it never  
reached his wifes account.
One week later Mr H attended his branch again  to find out why his wife still hadnt  received 
the money hed tried to transfer. He said NatWest told him the transaction hadnt gone 
through because  there was no name or account  number on the transaction  reference. This 
payment was made through  an intermediary bank, Ill call B. So, the money was being held 
by B.
Mr H asked NatWest to recall the money. But by August 2018 the money still hadnt been 
returned. So Mr H raised a complaint with NatWest about his money going missing. In his 
complaint he said NatWest had made a mistake whilst inputting the details which  had 
caused the money to become lost and so he thought it was responsible. He also said he 
wasnt happy with the length of time it took NatWest to issue the faster payment recall. Mr H 
said he had lost business opportunities as a result  of the money  not being recovered  
because he hadnt  been able to complete  the house purchase that the money was intended  
for. And he said his health had suffered as a result of what had happened.  
NatWest investigated  Mr Hs complaint but didnt uphold it. It said it hadnt  made  an error in 
keying in the transaction details because Mr H had checked the recipients bank account 
details used by the cashier  in branch when authorising the payment using his PIN. And it 
said that it had sent frequent  chasers to B to try to retrieve  Mr Hs money once he had told it 
the money was missing.  So, it said it had done  everything possible to get the money 
recalled. And it told Mr H it wasnt responsible for the money not being  returned.
Being dissatisfied with NatWests response  Mr H brought his complaint to our service. Our 
adjudicator looked into this. But, while they empathised with Mr H, they didnt uphold his 
complaint because they didnt think that NatWest  had done anything wrong here. And they 
also thought NatWest had made reasonable efforts to recover the missing  money.  Mr H 
disagreed and asked for the matter  to be referred to an ombudsman  for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While there  were a number of banks  involved  in this transaction, this complaint only relates 
to what NatWest did. So Ill focus on, and limit my findings, to whether NatWest acted fairly 
and reasonably here.
Ref: DRN34879742The first issue Ive considered is whether NatWest made a mistake  when it transferred the 
money Mr H asked it to send his wife. Having thought about what NatWest  and Mr H have 
said here Im not persuaded NatWest made  an error. Ill explain why.
Mr H said when he asked the cashier to make the payment  he gave them  the correct sort 
code and account number. He also said that the cashier asked  him to check  the details 
theyd keyed in on his behalf.  Having  checked  them, Mr H confirmed they were  correct and 
authorised the payment. Ive seen  the payment confirmation slip NatWest gave Mr H on the 
date he made the payment. It states  the payee  name and gives  the bank account  and sort 
code of B. I can see the payee reference  hasnt been completed with the account number or 
sort code  of Mr Hs wife, which explains why the money couldnt be allocated to her account. 
NatWest has said a payee reference  is optional  for a faster payment and that its system  
wont stop a payment if the customer doesnt provide (or want to use) a reference. As the 
reference isnt mandatory it cant tell a customer they must  use one or what to put. Instead, it 
said its up to a customer to notify  it what narrative they want  to use as the reference. 
Given what NatWest has said here, Im persuaded its reasonable for it to leave to a 
customers discretion what information  they wish to include here.  And it follows  that I dont 
think NatWest made an error  in not telling Mr H to insert his wifes account details as the 
payee reference. 
Mr H feels that the cashier  entered the wrong bank account and sort code information.  But 
the bank details used by NatWest here were  those of B  the intermediary bank.  Here  
NatWest needed  to use B to send the funds on to Mr Hs wife. So, while Mr H thinks  
NatWest used the wrong bank account information, Im persuaded that it was necessary for 
it to key in, and use, Bs details to make the transfer Mr H had instructed  it to make.  
Mr H was given the opportunity  to check the transaction details the cashier had keyed  in, or 
to ask questions  about anything he was concerned  about, before he authorised the 
transaction. And he entered his PIN after checking  the information the cashier had used. In 
doing so, he authorised NatWest to send the money to the account information it had used.
From the evidence Ive seen Im satisfied that NatWest processed this transaction correctly 
and in good faith. So, I cant  fairly conclude that NatWest are at fault for the payment not 
reaching Mr Hs wifes account.  And I can also see that Mr H was told that once the payment 
had left his account it couldnt be recalled.
Ive gone on to consider whether NatWest made reasonable attempts to recover the money 
once it was aware the money hadnt  reached the intended recipient.  When payments go 
missing we expect the bank sending the money to the intended recipient to make  reasonable 
efforts to recover the funds.
NatWest has provided evidence of the enquiries it made and the steps it took once it was 
aware that the money hadnt reached  Mr Hs wife. I can see that on 1 June 2018 NatWest  
completed a faster payment  reclaim  form at Mr Hs request.  This was the date Mr H told 
NatWest that he wanted it to recall his money.  So, Im persuaded that NatWest acted 
promptly in trying to recall the missing funds and that it sent the reclaim form to B without 
delay. 
I can see that NatWest regularly contacted B after 1 June  2018 to see how it was 
progressing Mr Hs claim. It emailed B on 4 and 27 June chasing  an outcome. On 27 June B 
Ref: DRN34879743responded that it hadnt been able to recover the money. And, on 25 July, NatWest 
contacted B again to request that it contact the recipients bank again. As B didnt respond, 
NatWest chased  it for a response on 1 and 12 September 2018. This all demonstrates  that 
NatWest regularly contacted B, who was at times unresponsive.  And Im satisfied that 
NatWest acted proactively  here. 
International transfers are accepted on an irrevocable basis.  And NatWest can only attempt 
to recall and recover missing funds on a best endeavours basis, which isnt guaranteed  to be 
successful. Based on the evidence Ive seen, Im satisfied  NatWest used its best endeavours 
and reasonable attempts  to trace Mr Hs missing  money. I think it acted proactively in trying  
to recover Mr Hs money for the reasons Ive already outlined. It follows that I dont think it 
could reasonably have done  any more than it did to help here. So I cant  reasonably say that 
NatWest shouldve done more in this situation.   
Im pleased to see that all of the money was located  and credited back to Mr H in February 
2019. And, while I can understand his frustration  that he didnt have access to that money for 
almost nine months, theres  no evidence that this was because NatWest  did anything  wrong.  
I think it did what it shouldve done to initially transfer the money  and then to get it back  when 
it was clear something had gone wrong.    
I know that Mr H will be disappointed by this decision. But Im satisfied that NatWest  has 
acted fairly  and reasonable for the reasons outlined. So, I wont be upholding this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2019.
