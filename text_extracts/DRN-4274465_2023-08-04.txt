The complaint
Mr A complains he hasnt had the benefit of a 3 on us offer on his hire purchase agreement
(agreement) with Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited (VWFS).
What happened
In September 2020 Mr A entered into an agreement with VWFS for a new car costing
£53,885.00. Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr A undertook
to make an advance payment of £2,224.92 followed by 3 monthly payments of £0,
45 monthly payments of £828.54 and 1 monthly payment of £21,147.50 making a total sum
repayable of £60,656.72 at an APR of 4.5%.
The invoice for the car suggests that the dealership paid £1,200.00 to allow the settlement
of the finance agreement linked to Mr As part exchanged car and £2,205.00 by way of a
deposit contribution.
The invoice also states, under the heading offer details:
PCP = 48 payments followed by 1 x GMFV based on 10000 miles per annum. Based on the
NHS deal with first 3 payments paid by [A]
On 31 August 2021 VWFS sent Mr A a statement of account. This showed, amongst other
things, the following:

less £828.54 payment made
In October 2022, following receipt of further statement of account (dated 31 July 2022), Mr A
complained to VWFS that he wasnt satisfied that he had got the benefit of the 3 on us offer.
In November 2022 VWFS issued Mr A with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of
this FRL VWFS said it was satisfied that Mr A had got the benefit or would get the benefit if
the agreement ran to term of the 3 on us offer.
In March 2023 VWFS refunded Mr A £576.91 made up of the first three months of interest
that had accrued under his agreement.
In March 2023, and unhappy with VWFS FRL, Mr A referred his complaint to our service.
Mr As complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it
shouldnt be upheld.
Mr A didnt agree with the investigators view so his complaint was passed to me for
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in July 2023. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach
what I think is the right outcome. I would also add that where the information Ive got is
incomplete, unclear, or contradictory Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
In summary Mr As agreement terms can be summarised as follows:
payments required 1 x £2,224.92
3 x £0.00
45 x £828.54
1 x £21,147.50
total payments required £60,656.72
APR 4.5%
Based on what VWFS has explained to our service its my understanding that had Mr A not
been offered 3 on us he would have been offered the following terms (or similar):
payments required 1 x £2,224.92
48 x £828.54
1 x £21,147.50
total payments required £63,142.34
APR 6.3%
And these alternative terms would have resulted (over the whole term of the agreement) in
Mr A being charged, and having to pay, £2,485.62 more.
If my understanding as outlined above is correct, Im satisfied that Mr A got the benefit of the
3 on us offer or will do so if the agreement runs to term. But Im not persuaded that how the
3 on us offer worked in practice was adequately or clearly explained to Mr A. So, Ive gone
on to consider what Mr A would have done differently had it been.
Now I know I cant say for certain what Mr A might have done differently. But on the balance
of probabilities, Im satisfied that more likely than not Mr A would have gone ahead on the
agreement terms that he did. In coming to this view, Ive had regard to the interest Mr A
appears to have shown in the car he purchased (even before finance terms were discussed
in any detail), the sums paid by the supplying dealership of £3,405.00 to secure the sale
and, although occurring after the event, the refund made by VWFS of £576.91.So, in summary, Im currently of the view that VWFS need do nothing further in respect of
this complaint. But further submissions from Mr A (on VWFS) might lead me to change my
mind.
VWFS responded to say it had nothing further to add.
Mr A responded to say that he was still of the view that he hadnt had the benefit of the 3 on 
us offer as promoted/explained to him by the dealership and to say that had how the offer 
worked in practice been clearly explained to him by the dealership he would have elected to 
purchase a different car from another manufacturer and dealership on different agreement 
terms. In support of the former Mr A has provided our service with two calculations. And in 
respect of the latter, he has provided our service with an agreement quote he had obtained 
(for a different car from another manufacturer and dealership) before committing to the 
agreement (with VWFS) that he did.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered what Mr A has submitted in response to my provisional decision I remain 
of the view that he got the benefit of the 3 on us offer as managed and administered by 
VWFS (or will do so if the agreement runs to term), but how this 3 on us offer worked in 
practice wasnt adequately or clearly explained to him.
Mr A says that had he understood how the 3 on us offer worked in practice he would have 
purchased a different car (from another manufacturer and dealership) which was a similar 
price. And faster.
I appreciate the different car Mr A says he would have purchased was listed with a similar 
on the road cost as to the one he ultimately purchased and that it may have been faster. 
But the on the road price and speed isnt, in my view, the only factors buyers take into 
account when deciding what car to buy. 
In this case although both cars have a similar on the road cost the agreement quote 
supplied to our service by Mr A (in respect of the different car) has an APR listed of 4.9%, 
whereas the agreement he entered into with VWFS was at an APR of 4.5% - making the 
alternative agreement (everything else being equal) in the region of £20 a month more 
expensive. And I think this would have had bearing on Mr As choice of car.
Furthermore, its my understanding that the difference in speed between the two cars isnt 
substantial and other factors such as each cars specification and available dealership 
and/or manufacturers deposit contributions would have had a bearing on Mr As choice.
As I said in my provisional decision, I accept I cant say for certain that Mr A wouldnt have 
elected to purchase another car from another manufacturer and dealership on different 
agreement terms had the 3 on us offer been adequately and clearly explained to him by the 
dealership. But, taking everything into account (including Mr As most recent submissions), 
Im not persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that he would have done so.
Given what I say above I can confirm that Im satisfied that having refunded £576.91 VWFS 
has adequately compensated Mr A in respect of this complaint, and it need do nothing 
further.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 September 2023.
