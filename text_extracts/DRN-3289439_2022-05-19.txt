The complaint
Mr Y complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) cancelled cinema tickets provided as a 
benefit to his account when he closed it. He would like the tickets reactivated , and 
compensation.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I have seen the terms and conditions for the account Mr Y opened. These state that if 
the account is closed any benefit  in this case cinema vouchers  may be cancelled. 
I appreciate Mr Ys point that the wording doesnt state the vouchers will be cancelled 
just that they might be.
I understand Mr Ys point that if Lloyds always cancels such benefits then  the 
wording  in the terms and conditions could be more specific. But the terms  make it 
clear that benefits might be cancelled on account closure. So, Mr Y would have been 
aware this was a risk when he closed his account.
I appreciate Mr Y had limited time to use the cinema tickets due to the pandemic 
restrictions. But I cant be certain had there not been a pandemic that he would have 
used the tickets in the seven months the account was open.
As I dont believe Lloyds has done anything wrong, I cant reasonably ask it to 
reactivate the tickets and compensate Mr Y as he would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2022.
