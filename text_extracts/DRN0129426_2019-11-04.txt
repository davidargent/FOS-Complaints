K821x#15Complaint
Mr L complains  Elevate Credit International  Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr L took 16 loans  with Sunny between March 2016  and August 2017. Ive included  some of 
the information weve received about the first 9 loans in the table below.

8 26/11/2016 18/04/2017 12 £150 £119.65
9 03/12/2016 18/12/2016 12 £50 £119.61
Subsequently, Sunny  says it then lent loans 10 to 16 between  10 December 2016  and
9 August 2017  and that these ranged  between £50 and £400. Sunny has told us that it 
shouldnt have given  Mr L these loans and therefore will refund the interest  paid together  
with compensatory  interest. Sunny says it will also remove these loans from Mr Ls credit file.   
Our adjudicator thought that loans 5 and 9 shouldnt have been given to Mr L. Sunny  
disagreed with the adjudicator but told us that it would  maintain its offer for loans
10 to 16.   
The complaint has been referred to me to consider. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Mr Ls applications  for borrowing to check if he could afford to pay back  
the amounts hed borrowed without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which  was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could  have taken  into account a number  
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Ls 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  stages  of a lending  
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN01294262But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr L. These factors include:
Mr L having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr L having a large  number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated  refinancing may signal that the borrowing  
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr L coming back for loans shortly  after previous  borrowing had been repaid  
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr L.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr L could sustainably  repay  his loans   not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr L was able to repay his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ls complaint.
As it appears Sunny agrees it shouldnt have given  Mr L loans 10 to 16 theres no longer a 
dispute about whether they should  have been lent. Sunny has agreed to refund interest  on 
these loans and remove them  from Mr Ls credit file. I think  this is fair and for ease  of 
reference Ive included these loans in the putting things right section below. 
So my decision mainly  focuses on Mr Ls remaining loans. 
I agree  with our adjudicator that it was unlikely Mr L would be able to repay loan 5 
sustainably. Loan  5 was the third occasion within a month that Sunny lent to Mr L and was 
taken out shortly after loans 1 and 4 had been repaid. Loans  3 and 5 also overlapped. 
Having considered Mr Ls pattern of lending I think its likely he had taken out loans 3 and 5 
to make up for a shortfall in his finances  following repayment of earlier lending.  
In these circumstances, I think its likely  Mr L would  have  struggled to repay loan 5 in a 
sustainable way.  
 
By the time Mr L had applied for loan 6 hed taken a significant number of loans  over a 
relatively short space  of time (around four months).  Some of these loans Mr L had held 
Ref: DRN01294263simultaneously, meaning he had multiple repayments to make in the same month or week.  I 
think Mr Ls pattern of borrowing should  have  suggested to Sunny that he didnt just have a 
short-term cash-flow problem, but a persistent shortage  of funds which  he was borrowing in 
order to top up. High-cost, short-term loans of the kind offered by Sunny are not suitable for 
this kind of use. I think Sunny should have  recognised the signs Mr L was likely using the 
loans in this way.
Loan 7 was then taken  out the same day that loan 6 was repaid.  And subsequently loans 8 
and 9 overlapped with loan 7. The loan amounts had also remained broadly the same 
between March 2016 and December 2016. And subsequently there was no real change in 
this pattern over the remainder of the lending relationship.  Taking all of this into account, I 
agree with what our adjudicator has said about these loans. I think the point had been 
reached where the loan history and loan pattern  indicated that the lending was likely  
unsustainable for Mr L. So I dont think Sunny should have lent loans 6 to 9.  
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr L loans  5 to 16, so its not right that he should  have  had to 
pay interest, fees or charges on these, or have  them affect his credit  file in a negative way. 
So to put things right Sunny should:
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr L which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made  the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) Pay Mr L the total of A plus B.
D) Remove any adverse  information  it has recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation to loan 5. 
The overall pattern  of borrowing for loans 6 to 16 means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse,  so these should be removed entirely from Mr Ls credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part and direct  Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) to take the actions outlined in the putting things right section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 December 2019.
