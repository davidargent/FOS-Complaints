The complaint
Mr T complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC  trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) defaulted 
his account.
What happened
Mr T had an account with Barclaycard. The limit was £4,600. His self-employed earnings 
were affected by the covid-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Barclaycard agreed to a payment 
holiday under the pandemic support scheme  so no payments were needed or made 
between May 2020 and July 2020. Mr T contained in financial difficulty and the last payment 
he made in 2020 was in August 2020  when the contractual minimum payment of £121.01 
was made. Mr T then didnt make any further payments in 2020.
On 24 February 2021, Barclaycard sent to Mr T a Notice of Default with the arrears at 
£642.42  and asked Mr T to pay this amount within 28 days. Then, on 12 March 2021, Mr T 
called Barclaycard who then agreed to a reduced payment plan of £30 per month for 12 
months. This required two qualifying payments of £30 to be made in March 2021 and April 
2021, following which the plan would run. Zero interest and fees were agreed. Mr T made 
one payment of £30 by direct debit on 19 April 2021. On  29 April 2021, Barclaycard 
defaulted Mr Ts account. By then, there were six missed payments.
Mr T complained. He said it wasnt fair to default his account because one payment of £30 
had been missed. And Barclaycard didnt contact him to advise him what had happened.
Barclaycard said they were correct to default Mr Ts account. There had been six missed 
payments. In the conversation on 12 March 2021, he was advised to make the first agreed 
payment of £30 manually himself, and a direct debit was set up for the April 2021 payment.  
Mr T brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclaycard had acted reasonably. 
She felt that Barclaycard had supported Mr T during a period of financial difficulty  with a 
payment holiday and a series of payment breaks between October 2020 and December 
2020. Theyd agreed to a reduced payment plan in March 2021  but Mr T hadnt made the 
two qualifying payments of £30, so the plan wasnt put in place. The terms of the plan had 
been set out in a letter dated 13 March 2021. She could also see that Barclaycard tried to 
contact Mr T on 13 April 2021, but the call wasnt successful. They then wrote to Mr T on 13 
April 2021 and asked him to contact them. But he didnt  and the account was then 
defaulted.
Mr T asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two aspects to Mr Ts complaint:
- Did Barclaycard treat him reasonably  as he was in financial difficulty?
- What happened in March 2021. And did Barclaycard communicate with Mr T clearly?
Mr Ts financial difficulty: in April 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced 
guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All 
lenders, including Barclaycard, had to put in place payment holidays on many credit 
agreements, including credit cards  to help customers who were affected. Customers could 
ask for a total of two payment holidays each of three months  whereby payments could be 
suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference agencies, although 
interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support was provided by firms up to the 
end of October 2020.  In line with the scheme, Barclaycard agreed to a three-month 
payment holiday for Mr T in April 2020. 
More generally, businesses have an obligation to treat customers in financial difficulty 
sympathetically and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says that businesses like 
Barclaycard should treat customers in difficulties with forbearance and due consideration. 
For example, a business might suspend or waive interest, accept lower payments, or defer 
them, and allow customers more time to repay their debt. 
I can see that Barclaycard agreed a number of payment breaks for Mr T  given his 
circumstances. These required no monthly payments and were interest-free. I can see they 
were agreed for each month between September 2020 and February 2021. Mr T was 
notified about the arrangements and that his credit file would reflect the plans.
And so  as Barclaycard supported Mr T through the payment holiday scheme and several 
payment breaks, I think its fair to say they acted reasonably.
What happened in March 2021: By March 2021, Mr T had missed six payments to his 
account. Barclaycard sent him a Notice of Default on 24 February 2021  which said the 
arrears were then £642.42 and needed to be paid within 28 days. Mr T then called 
Barclaycard on 13 March 2021. After going through his income and expenditure, Barclaycard 
agreed to a 12-month payment plan of £30 a month. Interest was to be zero. But  to set the 
plan up, they needed to see two qualifying payments of £30  to make sure Mr T was going 
to follow the plan. One was needed in March 2021, and one in April 2021. But only one 
amount was paid  by direct debit  on 19 April 2021. 
I listened to the call as I wanted to be sure everything was clear  as I wondered if there may 
have been some confusion about whether a direct debit would be set up for both payments. 
Barclaycards call handler said that two qualifying payments of £30 were required. But he 
advised Mr T that it was too late to set up a direct debit for the March 2021 payment and Mr 
T would need to make that manually himself. And a direct debit was set up for the April 2021 
payment (which went through on 19 April 2021). Mr T said he understood that and said he 
would make the first payment himself by using his banking app. The call handler also gave 
Mr T the number to call if he wanted to make the payment by phone. The call handler 
repeated that the first payment needed to be made by Mr T and the next one by direct debit.
Barclaycard then wrote to Mr T in 12 March 2021 with a letter which set out the terms of the 
plan. The letter said, Youll need to make two consecutive payments, one month after the 
other (as set out) in the table below. The table showed two payments of £30 were needed 
by 31 March 2021 and 30 April 2021. So  I think the letter, and conversation with Mr T were 
both clear.
Also, in the call on 12 March 2021, the call handler read out the terms of the plan including 
because youve missed payments before and a Notice of Default has been sent, further missed payments will result in a default. So  I think it was also made clear that a default 
could follow if the payments werent made.
When Mr T didnt make both payments, I can see Barclaycard did try to call him on 13 April 
2021  but without success. And they then wrote to Mr T on the same day and asked him to 
contact them. But, unfortunately, Mr T didnt do so until 8 May 2021  which was after the 
default was registered. I think its reasonable to expect Mr T to have contacted Barclaycard 
as theyd asked, but he didnt. 
And so, in summary, I consider Barclaycard did support Mr T through his period of financial 
difficulty; and continued to do so with the final plan of £30 for 12 months. But because Mr T 
didnt make the qualifying payments, the plan failed. I consider that Barclaycard were clear in 
their communications with him throughout, including when setting up the plan in March 2021. 
They did also try to contact him when both of the payments werent made. And so  I am not 
going to ask Barclaycard to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2022.
