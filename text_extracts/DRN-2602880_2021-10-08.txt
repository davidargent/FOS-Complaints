The complaint
Ms B complains that Topaz Finance Limited trading as Heliodor Mortgages (Heliodor) 
marked her credit file with arrears information.
What happened
Ms B had an unsecured loan from Heliodor. It was transferred from another lender in 
November 2019. The original amount lent was £11,200 in April 2005, payable over 25 years. 
Until June 2020, payments were up to date. In July 2020, there were arrears of £47.95. 
Heliodor notified credit reference agencies (CRAs) of missed payments in July 2020, August 
2020, September 2020, October 2020, November 2020 and December 2020. On 15 
September 2020, Heliodor wrote to Ms B to ask her to contact them  the arrears balance 
was then £87.74. In December 2020, the arrears balance was £246.90, and the loan 
balance was £4,699.54. 
Ms B complained  she said that Heliodor didnt advise her of the arrears before advising the 
credit reference agency. And they shouldve sent her monthly letters with arrears information 
after that. She said she only became aware of the information on her credit file when she 
tried to sell her property.
Heliodor said that no payments were received from April 2019, except for one credit of £142 
in September 2019. This meant there werent any arrears until July 2020  when the credit 
was used up. In July 2020, when the arrears reached more than one month, Ms Bs account 
was reported to the CRAs. They wrote to her in September 2020 and called her. Ms B 
retuned their call then and so was aware of the arrears at that stage. Since then, no 
payments have been made and the arrears have increased. They had an obligation to report 
accurate information to the CRAs  and thats what theyd done.
Ms B brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said Heliodor had acted fairly. She could 
see that arrears had been reported accurately to the CRAs from July 2020 to December 
2020. She thought that had Heliodor contacted Ms B earlier  in August 2020  then things 
wouldnt have been any different.
Ms B asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint. She said her main point was that 
Heliodor hadnt given her any advanced warning of what was going to happen, and that was 
unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Ms Bs complaint is that Heliodor shouldve advised her of the arrears position 
before they advised the CRAs. Monthly payments were £39.79. I can see that until June 
2020  she was up to date with payments  as there had been a credit of £142 paid into the 
account in September 2019. This put her ahead with her payments by £349.95. After that  
no payments were made. By June 2020, Ms B was in arrears by £8.16. The payment due in 
July 2020 wasnt made. This meant that Ms B was then £47.95 in arrears. The monthly 
payments needed were £39.79 and so by then she was one month in arrears. All lenders, 
including Heliodor, must advise accurate information to CRAs. So  by July 2020, Heliodor 
were entitled to notify the CRAs that Ms Bs account was in arrears. I can then see that no 
more payments were made so that by December 2020, Ms B was six months in arrears - 
£246.90.
Looking at Ms Bs main complaint - that Heliodor shouldve told her what was going on 
earlier and before the CRAs were notified in July 2020. I can see where shes coming from  
Heliodor wrote to her on 15 September 2020, and she then returned their call. I can see that 
at that stage, Ms B was aware of the arrears  as they were in the letter and discussed in the 
phone call. But by then  Ms B was two months in arrears, with the arrears balance £87.84. 
Ive considered whether Heliodor acted fairly by not contacting Ms B before they first notified 
the CRAs about the missed payments - in July 2020 or August 2020.  But - Ms B hadnt 
made any payments to the loan since September 2019. And more importantly  she didnt 
make any payments after Heliodor had got in touch with her in September 2020. So  by 
then, the arrears were £246.90 - and Ms B hadnt tried to bring her account up to date.  And 
looking at Heliodors records  she didnt try to contact them to discuss repayments either. 
So - Im not persuaded that things would have worked out any differently even if Heliodor 
had contacted Ms B earlier  because by December 2020, she hadnt made a payment for 
15 months.
I can see that Ms B feels strongly about her complaint. And so, she will be disappointed by 
my decision. But I dont think that Heliodor acted unfairly, and I wont be asking them to do 
anymore here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2021.
