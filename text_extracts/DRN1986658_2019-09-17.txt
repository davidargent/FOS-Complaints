Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 29 short term loans Sunny provided to Mr P between 
September 2014 and September 2017.  All the loans have been repaid. All the loans except 
Loan 1 were repayable by six monthly  instalments. Loan 1 was running account credit  which  
allowed Mr P to drawdown amounts up to his credit  limit of £150.  But his first drawdown  
amount was £100. Mr Ps lending history is as follows:

In its final response letter,  Sunny said that there were indicators at certain points in its 
lending that the product may  not have been suitable  for Mr Ps needs.  So Sunny offered to 
refund the interest and charges paid on Loan 1 and pay simple interest of 8% on the 
refunds. It said that as the loan had been  repaid on time, there was no adverse data to 
remove from Mr Ps credit  file about  the loan.
Mr P rejected Sunnys offer.
Ref: DRN19866582our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld in part. As Sunny had 
upheld Loan  1 in its final response letter, the adjudicator said he wouldnt be considering  this 
loan and his investigation would focus  on the remaining loans. He concluded that Loans 5 
onwards shouldnt have been  given to Mr P.
Mr P responded to the adjudicators view by saying he had nothing  to add.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators recommendations.  It said that its loans were  not only 
sustainable but also affordable. It said that the largest loan was for £150 and Mr P never  
missed a payment.  Sunny also said that there  were  gaps  between each loan which  showed  
that Mr P wasnt reliant on the loans. It said that paying the loans early suggested that Mr P 
was on top of his finances  and didnt want to pay more interest than he needed to. Sunny 
said that there was no pattern to show that Mr P took out a loan to repay a previous  one. 
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr P 
and to Sunny on 6 August  2019.  I summarise my findings:
Id noted that Sunny  had offered in its final response  letter to provide a refund of interest and 
charges paid by Mr P on Loan 1 and pay statutory interest on those refunds. So, except for 
ordering Sunny  to provide the offered redress later in my decision,  I said I wouldnt make  any 
other findings about Loan 1.
I explained that when Sunny lent to Mr P the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  
(CONC). The CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
I said that Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate  checks to make  sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I thought  less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors included:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer had been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated  
refinancing might  signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN19866583There might  even come a point where the lending  history  and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought it was important  to say that Sunny was required to establish whether  Mr P could 
sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. 
I explained that the loan payments  being  affordable on this basis  might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow  this 
was the case.  This was because the CONC defined sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the consumer  should be able to make repayments, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it followed that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wouldnt be able to make their repayments  sustainably  if they were unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Mr Ps complaint.
Sunny did a number  of checks  before  it lent to Mr P. It had asked him for details  of his 
income and expenditure. Mr Ps declared  income  for Loans  1 to 20 was £1,400 and for his 
other loans  it was £1,500. 
Sunny also checked  Mr Ps credit file before agreeing to the loans. It had provided us with a 
summary of the results of its credit checks including  Mr Ps other credit commitments. It 
appeared from the summaries Id seen that there wasnt any adverse information such as 
bankruptcy, IVAs  or debt management plans that I thought should have caused additional 
concerns to Sunny.
Id also seen Mr Ps credit  report.  This showed that Mr P had experienced some financial 
problems in the past. Hed had two accounts in default, but importantly the credit report  
showed his last default had happened  over 13 months before Loan 2. 
Mr P needed  to make monthly loan repayments of around £46 to £48 to Sunny for Loans  2 
to 4. I thought these  were relatively  modest compared to Mr Ps declared  income.  
Given Mr Ps repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the time, 
and his history with the lender, I didnt  think it wouldve been proportionate  for Sunny to ask 
him for the amount of information that would be needed to show  Loans 2 to 4 were 
unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr P provided before Loans 2 to 4 or the 
information Sunny shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been  proportionate to 
start verifying what he was saying.  So I didnt think Sunny was wrong  to give Loans 2 to 4 to 
Mr P. 
But as Loan 5 was Mr Ps fourth loan in around three months,  I thought Sunny should have 
been concerned  that Mr P might  have been reliant  on its lending.  And I didnt think it was 
reasonable for Sunny to base its assessment before Loan 5 on the information  provided by 
Mr P without taking steps to independently  check what  hed declared.  So I thought it might 
have been proportionate  at this time for Sunny to have independently  reviewed the true state  
of Mr Ps finances. This was to make  sure Mr P was in position to make  the repayments  
Ref: DRN19866584sustainably. As far as I could see Sunny didnt do this. So I needed to think  about what  
Sunny wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr P had provided some information about his financial circumstances which included his 
credit report  and bank statements. But having  looked at these, I couldnt safely say that 
Sunny wouldve seen that Mr P couldnt sustainably  make  the repayments  to Loan 5. So I 
didnt uphold  his complaint about this loan. 
Id looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending with Mr P to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I thought that this point had been  reached 
by Loan 6. I said this because:
There was an emerging pattern between Loans 2 to 5 of Mr P taking new loans 
shortly after repaying  previous ones. I thought that by Loan 6, Sunny ought  fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established. By Loan  6 Mr P had taken a 
new loan every month since Loan 2. I thought that indicated that Mr P was becoming 
dependent on this type of borrowing.
By Loan  6, Mr P had been borrowing from Sunny for over seven months. 
There were  some  small gaps between loans being repaid and a new loan being  
granted. But, I didnt  think  it would have  been  reasonable  for Sunny to conclude 
these gaps were any indication that Mr Ps finances had moved  on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans.
I could see that as Sunny didnt stop lending at that point,  Mr P went on to take out another 
23 loans in the following 28 months. I thought that Mr P lost out because Sunny  continued to 
provide borrowing from Loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ps ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
The fact that the loans  were  repaid didnt mean  that they were repaid sustainably,  or 
without causing  Mr P undue difficulty. 
Id noted that Sunny  had said that the loans  were not only sustainable but also affordable  
and it said that Mr P had never missed a repayment.  But I thought Sunny would (or ought to) 
know from previous decisions (as well as whats set out on our website) that there were 
cases where this service considered the overall lending pattern and not just the affordability 
of each loan. And there would be times when the pattern of lending  alone was enough to 
indicate that a consumer  was likely  to be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be 
harmed should  relending  have  continued.  So it followed that successful  repayment  of a 
loan didnt automatically mean it was repaid sustainably.
Ref: DRN19866585Sunny said that the gaps between each  loan showed that Mr P wasnt reliant on the loans. 
There were some limited gaps between loans  being repaid and a new loan being granted, 
including one of around ten weeks before Loan  16 and one of around 12 weeks  before 
Loan 27. But I didnt think it would have  been reasonable for Sunny to have  concluded these 
gaps were any indication  that Mr Ps finances had moved on from whatever situation had 
required his previous loans. There was an established pattern of borrowing which ought to 
have concerned Sunny irrespective of the length of pauses in Mr Ps loan applications.
Sunny also said that paying the loans early suggested that Mr P was on top of his finances. 
Id noted that Loans 2 onwards were scheduled to be repaid over six months, and Mr P 
repaid each of them  early. But I thought  that this behaviour might have caused  Sunny some 
concerns rather than showing he was on top of his finances. And I said that Sunny would 
also be aware that this service didnt accept that a borrower repaying a loan early  or on time 
meant it was automatically  repaid sustainably. 
In addition Sunny said that there  was no pattern  to show Mr P took out a loan to repay  his 
previous one. But most of the loans  were taken out very shortly after a previous loan had 
been repaid. So I considered that Sunny  ought  fairly and reasonably  to have  been  alert to 
the possibility  that Mr P mightve been seeking  further funds to cover  the hole left in his 
finances by the repayment of a previous loan. I also thought  that Mr Ps borrowing history 
from Loan 5 might have  suggested to Sunny that it was likely Mr Ps finances were  under 
strain, and that he was most likely  borrowing to support his day to day living  costs  and debt 
repayments rather than for a one-off  emergency.  I thought Mr P continued to reborrow in a 
way that suggested a long-term dependence  on expensive  short-term credit.  
And when  a consumer  borrowed numerous loans over a long period of time, it was most 
likely that the loans werent being  used for their intended purpose of temporary cash  flow 
problems. As Sunny  knew,  the FCA made it clear in a recent letter  to CEOs of high cost 
lending firms that a high volume of relending..might be symptomatic of unsustainable  
lending patterns. And I thought that was the case here.
So, I thought that Sunny needed  to pay Mr P some  compensation  relating to Loans 6 to 29 
along with what  it had already offered in relation to Loan 1. 
Subject to any further representations by Mr P or Sunny my provisional decision was that 
I intended to uphold this complaint in part. I intended  to order  Sunny to:-
 1. Refund all interest and any charges Mr P paid on Loan 1 and Loans 6 onwards;
 2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they 
     were paid to the date of settlement*;
 3. Remove all adverse  entries about  Loan  1 from Mr Ps credit file; and
 4. Remove all entries about Loans  6 onwards from Mr Ps credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr P responded to say that he was happy  with the provisional decision and had nothing to 
add.
Sunny responded by asking for a weeks extension to provide a response. This service  
agreed to a weeks extension but no further information was received from Sunny in 
response to my provisional  decision. 
Ref: DRN19866586my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Given that Mr P and Sunny have given me nothing further to consider,  I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I reached  in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold  part 
of the complaint and require Sunny to pay Mr P some compensation as set out below.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Elevate  Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, to:
 1. Refund all interest and any charges Mr P paid on Loan 1 and Loans 6 onwards;
 2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they 
     were paid to the date of settlement*;
 3. Remove all adverse  entries about  Loan  1 from Mr Ps credit file; and
 4. Remove all entries about Loans  6 onwards from Mr Ps credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2019.
