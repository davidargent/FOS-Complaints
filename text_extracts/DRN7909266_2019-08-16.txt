K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc gave him an incorrect number for its 
collections team. 
Mr L also complains that he was told he couldnt  use the compensation hed been  paid 
because his credit card balance was still over the agreed limit. 
Mr L says the calls hes had with NatWest were  unprofessionally handled.
background
On 8 May 2019  Mr L called NatWest to check a number  he was given for its collections 
team. He also mentioned that hed been charged an annual credit card fee which reduced 
compensation hed received for a different matter. 
NatWest agreed the number he was given was wrong and paid him £50 to apologise. But 
NatWest said the annual fee was correctly charged and didnt agree an error had been 
made. It agreed to waive an over limit fee of £12. Mr L asked NatWest  to use the £50 to 
reduce his balance and was told the payment would bring it below his credit  limit. 
Mr L called  back on 9 May 2019  and asked whether the funds paid on the previous day were 
available to spend. He was told that whilst the funds had credited his account his balance 
was still over the credit limit. Mr L said that was wrong. The call handler also advised  Mr L 
not to spend on his credit card because hed missed a previous payment and risked 
incurring further  charges.  
Mr L complained and NatWest responded on 15 May 2019. NatWest  agreed Mr L had been 
given the wrong  number,  had been  given incorrect advice about whether his account  was in 
arrears and had spent time discussing the situation. But it didnt agree the annual  fee was 
incorrectly applied or that Mr L had been spoken  to rudely. NatWest  agreed to pay Mr L a 
further £50 plus £10.80  in call costs.  
Mr L referred his complaint to our service  and an investigator looked at it. The investigator 
agreed NatWest had made some mistakes but felt it had dealt with the complaint fairly and 
that the compensation paid was reasonable. Mr L didnt  agree so his complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Mr L has raised other complaints about issues hes experienced with 
NatWest. But in this decision  Im only looking at the complaint points surrounding his calls 
with NatWest on 8 and 9 May 2019.  His other complaints have been dealt with separately so 
I cant comment on what happened.
Ive listened to the calls Mr L had with NatWest on 8 May 2019. The call handler confirmed 
hed been given an incomplete number  for the collections team  and paid him £50 to 
apologise. The call handler  explained  that the annual fee had been correctly  applied but 
arranged for the over limit fee of £12 to be waived.  I think  the £50 NatWest  paid to Mr Ls 
Ref: DRN79092662credit card fairly reflects  the impact of being given a wrong number. When he called the error 
was quickly corrected and I note the contact  details of NatWests  collections teams  are 
available elsewhere.  Im satisfied NatWest  dealt with this part of Mr Ls complaint fairly.  
Mr L called  back on 9 May 2019  and asked whether the £50 compensation he was awarded 
had cleared and could  be used. The call handler he spoke with said his system advised the 
account was still £5.20 over its limit. He also advised that Mr L not to use his credit card until 
hed made  up a missed  direct debit from the previous month in order to avoid further  
charges. 
I know Mr L feels NatWest gave him incorrect information here and the investigators 
confirmed that he did have funds available. Whilst I agree the information about his 
outstanding balance appears to have been  wrong, I note NatWest has since agreed to pay a 
further £50 for the error it made. 
Having listened  to the calls Mr L made on 8 and 9 May 2019  I didnt find any evidence that 
they were handled  unprofessionally or that the call handlers were rude. I thought they did 
their best to help and provide as much information  as possible. Whilst I accept there  was an 
error when  Mr L was told his balance was over the agreed limit NatWest  has offered 
compensation for that. On 9 May 2019 NatWests call handler advises Mr L not to spend on 
his card to ensure he avoided further charges as his previous payment hadnt been made. I 
think that was well meaning advice and the call handler went on to tell Mr L it was his choice. 
Mr L says the impact of that mistake was substantial and caused him a lot of hardship. I 
wont list everything Mr Ls told us about the impact here but I want to assure him Ive 
considered everything  hes said concerning how the matter affected him. NatWest has paid 
Mr L a total of £100 plus £10.80 in call costs to resolve his complaint. Ive thought  about  
whether that figure is fair and reasonable reflects the impact of its errors. Whilst I note 
everything Mr L says about how the mistakes affected him, Im satisfied the compensation 
NatWest has paid is fair in all the circumstances. As I think  NatWest has dealt with Mr Ls 
complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 September  2019.
