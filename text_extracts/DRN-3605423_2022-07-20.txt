The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that Barclays Banks UK PLC wont refund transactions he made as part of
an investment scam.
The transaction came from a business account. Because hes a sole trader, Ive just referred
to him as Mr H.
What happened
In August 2018, Mr H came across a company, Brighter Trade  he wanted to get into
trading for the first time after he inherited some money. He explained the account
seemed to grow initially but he then started to lose money  in response, he was told to
invest more so he could recoup what hed lost and retain his VIP account status. Mr H
recalled that he asked to withdraw money at times but he was dissuaded from taking larger
amounts, being told to leave it there so hed more leverage to invest. As part of trading with
Brighter Trade, its understood that Mr H made some deposits via Bitxplace, a crypto
exchange.
In December 2018, Mr H said he couldnt get through to Brighter Trade and saw hed lost a
substantial amount. He later came across a claims management company and realised that
he alongside others had been scammed.
In January 2019, Mr H contacted Barclays to dispute the payments hed made as part of the
scam. The merchants largely defended these claims, except for three payments to
FBX*Bitxplace totalling £15,000.
Mr H raised a complaint with Barclays  he didnt think it handled the chargeback process
correctly, which meant he didnt get his money back. Barclays said it couldnt do anything
more for Mr H to pursue the claims, but it did pay £150 compensation for a mistake it made
with how it credited and re-debited Mr Hs account.
Ive included a table with the transactions in dispute and the money that was returned to Mr

So, in all, Mr H paid the merchants £133,400 and he received £28,100 back. This makes the
total amount in dispute £105,300.00.
On 30 June 2022, I sent my provisional findings. In summary, I thought Barclays shouldve 
intervened and that wouldve likely stopped Mr H making further payments. Because of this, I 
asked Barclays to refund the disputed payments less the first two payments to Brighter 
Trade and less any amount refunded by the merchants. I also thought a 20% deduction 
should be made for contributory negligence. Barclays accepted my findings and had nothing further to add. Mr H respectfully challenged 
the 20% deduction on account of the lack of intervention and Barclays handling of the 
dispute. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having thought about Mr Hs response carefully, Ive not changed my mind about the 
outcome to this complaint. 
I was sorry to read about the horrible time Mr H has been through and I dont doubt what a 
devastating effect this scam had on him. I want to be clear that in deciding Mr H shares 
some blame isnt to take away from how he was ultimately a victim in this situation. 
But, as an independent decision marker, I must also recognise that Barclays was not the 
perpetrator of this scam. So, in holding Barclays responsible for its failures to intervene, it 
seems only fair to reflect on whether Mr H reasonably shoulders some blame too. 
Deductions for contributory negligence arent an exact science. Here, I dont think Mr H is as 
much to blame for his losses as Barclays are. But I do, as it seems Mr H accepts, think he 
bears some responsibility. My provisional findings set out why, and while Ive considered Mr 
Hs response carefully, I remain of the opinion that a 20% deduction is fair and reasonable. 
So Ive not changed my mind about the outcome of Mr Hs complaint. For completeness, Ive 
included my provisional findings below:
Its not in dispute that Mr H was a victim of a scam. For completeness, I agree. The Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning about Brighter Trade for operating without the
required authorisation. That indicates they were operating illegally, probably with dishonest
intentions  as legitimate firms tend to comply with regulatory requirements. And the
behaviour Mr H has reported  the expectation of unrealistic profits with minimal risk, being
told to invest more to recoup losses and refusing large withdrawals  is indicative of a scam.
Its also not in dispute that Mr H authorised the transactions. So the starting position is that
hes liable for the resulting loss. But there are some situations where we believe that banks 
taking into account relevant rules, codes and best practice  ought to have identified a fraud
risk, so should have looked at the wider circumstances.
Barclays said no concerns were raised with these transactions. Having reviewed Barclays
Customer Notepad Details, it did contact Mr H about transactions on 8 August 2018 and
confirmed they were genuine. Its not clear this included the £500 payment to Brighter Trade.
But even if it did, I think its more likely that Barclays concerns related to the flurry of activity
that day, which included a £100,000 credit. So I accept that checking the transactions were
genuine wouldve been a proportionate response to that concern.
But I agree with our investigator that Barclays ought to have intervened later. On 14 August
2018, two transactions to the same merchant were made within 15 minutes  totalling
£10,000. So I think Barclays should have been concerned about why these payments
werent made in one go and whether attempts were being made to circumvent its detection
systems by making smaller consecutive payments.
Taking this into account, I think Barclays shouldve contacted Mr H when the second
payment for £5,000 on 14 August 2018 was attempted. If it had done so, and if it had askedsuitably probing questions about the payment, Im persuaded it would have uncovered that
Brighter Trade werent regulated by the FCA. It couldve also unveiled that theyd told him to
expect significant profit with very little risk. So, in line with the FCAs advice on how to avoid
investment scams from the time, it couldve warned Mr H that it was probably a scam.
If Barclays, speaking from a position of trust and expertise about financial services and
scams, had said this, I dont think he would have proceeded with the payment. Afterall, this
was his first experience with trading and I dont think he wouldve known before what to be
wary of. So Im satisfied Barclays can be held liable for the loss Mr H suffered from that
point.
Contributory negligence
Ive considered whether Mr H contributed to his losses. As Ive said, he was an
inexperienced investor and there wasnt much information available online about Brighter
Trade before he invested. I can also understand how the platforms presentation and the
guidance of experts gave Mr H confidence. This was a sophisticated operation.
However, Im also mindful that Mr H invested over £130,000 over four months. So, at some
point, he wasnt just trying it out  this became a significant investment. Given this, Id have
expected Mr H to have done more to reassure himself that Brighter Trade were legitimate
and to understand what the warning signs of investment scams were. Had he have done
this, its possible he couldve uncovered their lack of regulation and the likelihood this was a
scam himself. He may have also discovered the FCAs warning about Brighter Trade, first
published on 31 August 2018.
In these circumstances, I think it would be fair to reduce compensation by 20% on the basis
that Mr H should share some blame for what happened.
Chargeback
Mr H is unhappy that he wasnt given the opportunity to pursue the chargeback claims after
the merchants defended them. But I dont think it wouldve changed the outcome of these
claims.
Thats because binary-options and forex trading disputes were only included with the scope
of VISAs reason code 13.5 (misrepresentation) where the merchant guaranteed returns,
which Ive not seen evidence of. Or, where it stopped the cardholder from withdrawing funds.
This required very specific evidence, such as how they attempted to resolve the dispute with 
the merchant, a dated screenshot of their available balance and evidence of their withdrawal
request. Again, Ive not seen that this evidence was available here.
I have considered whether, had Barclays intervened in August 2018, it couldve
supported Mr H with getting the required evidence. But theres nothing to show what the
available balance was at the time. So I cant say what hed have been able to claim.
It follows that I dont think Barclays approach to the chargeback claims caused Mr H to lose
out.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint. I order Barclays Bank UK PLC to 
refund the payments made as part of the scam, less the first two payments to Brighter Trade 
and less any amount refunded by the merchants. Barclays should then deduct 20% for 
contributory negligence. I understand that amounts to an award of £79,840.This was a Mr Hs business account, so Barclays should add interest to that sum (less any
tax properly deductible) at the relevant account rate from the respective dates of loss to
the date of refund. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2022.
