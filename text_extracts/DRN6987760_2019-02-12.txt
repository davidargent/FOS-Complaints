K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that the loans he had from Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) 
were unaffordable.
background
Mr P had three loans  from Lending Stream between August 2017 and January 2018:
Loan Date Amount Term Max payment Due Repaid
1 10 Aug 2017 £300 170d £129.36 26 Jan 2018 10 Nov 2017
2 4 Dec 2017 £400 173d £172.80 25 May 2018 1st instalment
3 5 Jan 2018 £170 173d £240.64* 26 Jun 2018 1st instalment
* Maximum  monthly  payment due on overlapping loans 2 and 3
Mr P says he didnt have enough  disposable income to make the repayments without 
borrowing from other short-term lenders. It says Lending Stream should have realised his 
debt problems were  getting  worse  from his borrowing pattern. He adds  that the figures 
Lending Stream quote with reference to his expenditure at the time were  incorrect.
Lending Stream says it asked Mr P for information about his income and expenditure for 
each loan and also carried  out a credit  check. It says the repayments were  affordable  out of 
Mr Ps disposable income and that his credit  rating  was satisfactory. Although  it didnt uphold  
Mr Ps complaint, it offered to set up a repayment plan for the outstanding debt.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. He considered  
Lending Stream had done enough  checks before approving  the loans, but found that the 
information provided by Mr P should have indicated that loan 3 was unaffordable to him. 
Lending Stream had calculated his disposable income to be less than £300, but Mr P was 
scheduled to pay over £240  on loans  2 and 3 in February 2018.  Our adjudicator  said he 
wasnt in a position to sustainably meet his loan repayments and recommended Lending 
Stream should refund  the interest and charges  on loan 3 (plus 8% statutory interest)  and 
remove any associated negative information from his credit  file.
Mr P requested an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lending Stream was required to lend responsibly.  It should  have  made checks to make sure 
Mr P could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr P was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Lending  Stream had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr P applied  for his first loan with Lending Stream,  he applied  for £500. 
Lending Stream asked  Mr P for information  about  his income and expenditure and, based on 
data it had about average expenditure, revised Mr Ps expenditure upwards. It calculated 
Mr Ps disposable income as almost £700,  and approved a £300 loan. Im satisfied the 
Ref: DRN69877602repayments on loan 1 were affordable based on the information Lending Stream  had at the 
time.
Mr P repaid  loan 1 early and applied for a further £500 three weeks later.  Lending Stream 
carried out the same checks and calculated Mr Ps disposable income  to be over £1,100.  I 
consider these checks went far enough and I acknowledge Lending Stream  again approved 
less than the requested loan, at £400. As the maximum repayment due on loan 2 was just 
over £170  I dont find Lending Stream was wrong  to approve it.
Loan 3
Mr P then applied for a further loan of £1,000.  Lending Stream carried out the same analysis 
as before and approved a loan of £170. But although Mr P had paid the first instalment of 
loan 2, he still owed  a further five instalments. This meant that, in February 2018, he needed  
to repay  over £240 to Lending Stream in one month.  As Lending Stream had calculated his 
disposable income to be under £290,  I cant agree  such a repayment was affordable  to Mr P. 
This would have left him with little money with which to meet any unforeseen expenses, 
especially considering  the repayments  were to continue for six months.
So, in summary,  I dont find Lending  Stream should have approved loan 3.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. Gain Credit LLC (trading as 
Lending Stream)  should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr P paid on loan 3;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 3, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr P; 
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Ps credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2019.
