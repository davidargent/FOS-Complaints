DRN-2332058
The complaint
Ms K is unhappy that a marker has been placed on her credit file in relation to a finance 
agreement with Advantage Finance Ltd.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I wasnt proposing to uphold this complaint. In 
summary, I concluded that it was more likely than not that Ms K misused the direct debit 
indemnity claim facility and I explained why I thought Advantage had acted fairly when it 
applied the marker.
I invited Ms K and advantage to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted 
to make before I finally determined the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms K didnt respond to my provisional decision. Advantage responded and said it agreed 
with it. I havent seen any further evidence to persuade me to reach different conclusions to 
the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
