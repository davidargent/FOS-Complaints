The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wont pay interest to him. 
What happened
Mr W says that in February 2018 he fell victim to a scam. He was approached by a company 
that said it could help him to get out of his timeshare contract and mount a legal claim to get 
his money back. Mr W was required to pay this company through PayPal and paid £2,995 
via PayPal using a credit card. In around 2020 Mr W found out the company he had paid 
acted fraudulently and in July 2020 Mr W wrote to PayPal saying he wanted to open a 
dispute about the £2,995 payment. 
PayPal responded to Mr W and referred to its User Agreement, and in particular its Buyer 
Protection, which only applies for 180 days from the date of payment. As Mr W made the 
payment on 14 February 2018, he was well outside of this period.
Mr W wasnt happy with PayPals response and brought a complaint to this service. He said 
that European law says the 180-day time period starts when he found out hed paid a 
fraudulent company, not from the date of payment. 
While the investigator was considering Mr Ws complaint PayPal made an offer to settle it. 
PayPal offered to refund £2,995, which Mr W accepted. Later though, Mr W asked this 
service to reopen his complaint as interest wasnt awarded and his credit card provider had 
added a lot of interest since the payment was made. Mr W also referred to circumstantial 
evidence to the effect that PayPal might be facilitating scams by making it easy to open 
accounts. 
The investigator said that as PayPal had offered to refund the transaction it would be fair to 
award interest at the rate of 8% simple per year from 14 February 2018 to the date PayPal 
refunded £2,995  to reflect the fact Mr W had been deprived of these funds.
Mr W noted that his credit card provider had charged interest at a higher rate but felt the 
offer was fair to both parties. PayPal didnt agree with the investigators findings and asked 
for a final decision, so the complaint has been passed to me. PayPal said that it made a 
proactive offer to settle with no admission of liability. It said its offer to refund Mr W was on a 
goodwill basis and reiterated that Buyer Protection only covers disputes for 180 days after 
the payment is made. In this case, Mr W didnt dispute the payment for over two years and 
the interest mounted to nearly £1,000. As PayPal had already made a substantial payment it 
didnt consider it was responsible for, it didnt agree to pay anything more.
I considered Mr Ws complaint and issued a provisional decision on 24 August 2023. I didnt 
ask PayPal to pay interest to Mr W. In the What Ive provisionally decided  and why 
section I said,
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Im really sorry to hear of the circumstances in which Mr W lost funds.
Firstly, I should explain to Mr W that Im required to consider the individual circumstances of 
his complaint and whether PayPal has acted reasonably. I cant consider wider issues like 
Mr Ws belief that scammers may use PayPal accounts because they are easier to open. 
To decide if PayPal should fairly and reasonably pay interest to Mr W, I need to consider 
whether it treated him fairly in rejecting his dispute in 2018. Im sorry to disappoint Mr W, but 
I think it did and will explain why. 
To use its service all PayPal customers are required to agree to its User Agreement. 
Amongst other things, this sets out how PayPal resolves disputes. PayPals Buyer Protection 
may apply if a customer doesnt receive an item, or the item arrives, and it is not as 
described. 
There is a question mark here around whether the service offered to Mr W comes within the 
Buyer Protection scheme, as he wasnt buying an item. Instead, Mr W was paying for a 
service. 
In any event, PayPals Buyer Protection says that a transaction can only be eligible for Buyer 
Protection if a customer opens a dispute within 180 days of the date the payment is sent. 
The scheme rules are clear that the relevant date is the date of payment and not the date a 
customer becomes aware that something hasnt gone as they expected. Mr W first contacted 
PayPal over two years after the relevant transaction was made so isnt eligible for Buyer 
Protection.
Mr W says European law is clear that the clock only starts when he became aware that the 
company he paid was fraudulent, but I dont agree. 
So, although I dont think PayPal needed to refund Mr W it decided to do so on a goodwill 
basis. In these circumstances, I dont consider it would be fair to require PayPal to add 
interest to the amount it agreed to refund. I realise Mr W will be extremely disappointed with 
this outcome, but I need to be fair to both parties.
Mr W let me know that he wasnt happy with my provisional decision. In summary, he said:
- I was wrong when I said Mr W complained to PayPal in 2018.
- EU law says he has 180 days from the date he became aware of the scam to raise a 
dispute. This law should override any of PayPals terms. 
- PayPal didnt make a payment as a gesture of goodwill but under EU law.
PayPal accepted my provisional decision and had no further comments to make.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered Mr Ws response but nothing he has said has led me to change my mind. Ill 
address his points in turn.
Ive re-read my provisional decision and noted that I didnt say Mr W complained to PayPal 
in 2018. I said that was when he fell victim to a scam and that he wrote to PayPal in July 
2020.
Im uncertain what EU law Mr W is referring to as he hasnt been specific. Im not aware of 
any EU law that states that he has 180 days from when he found out hed been scammed to 
raise a dispute. PayPals terms are clear, and I see no reason why they shouldnt apply.
PayPal has been clear that it made the offer to Mr W as a gesture of goodwill and without 
any admission of liability. It never accepted that it had any obligation to refund Mr W, 
whether under EU law or otherwise.
In the circumstances, I dont consider it fair to require PayPal to pay interest on the amount it 
agreed to refund Mr W. My final decision
For the reasons stated, I do not propose to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
