K821x#15complaint
Company A is a business that sells goods online.  They use PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA 
to process their online payments. Company A has complained that PayPal will not reimburse 
them almost  £5000 - the value of chargebacks applied to their account. 
background
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 29 July 2019,  a copy of which  is 
attached below and forms part of this decision.
In summary  I said it was likely that Company A wouldve registered for 3D Secure if PayPal 
had told them about this. But I hadnt  seen anything to show  me that 3D Secure wouldve 
stopped any transactions that resulted in chargeback  requests being  made.  Company  A 
were able to challenge these chargeback requests, but these challenges  were  unsuccessful.  
Because of this their bank has refunded almost £5,000  to customers Company A say theyve 
sent goods to.
I didnt think it was fair to ask PayPal to reimburse  Company A almost £5,000 but I could  see 
that Company  A had been affected  by what had happened  this is money they couldnt 
afford to lose. As they would never know if having 3D Secure wouldve stopped any of the 
transactions from being approved, I felt  it was fair that PayPal compensate  Company A for 
the inconvenience of their not knowing if any of the transactions couldve been stopped had 
3D Secure been in place.  I considered £150  to be fair and reasonable in all of the 
circumstances.
Both Company A and PayPal have been given the opportunity to comment on my provisional  
decision.
Both PayPal  and Company A have rejected my provisional decision. Company A have said 
they were approached by PayPal and, by not telling them about 3D Secure,  the payment 
portal was mis-sold to them. They say they never had any successful chargeback  requests 
with their previous  payment portal but, within days of using PayPal,  they were  targeted  by a 
person or group who knew  to go onto our website and purchase items  then implement  
charge backs for the delivered items. Company  A feels its PayPals  responsibility  to 
implement solid security measures  and the poor security lead to a devastating  loss of 
almost £5,000. 
Company A also feel that my provisional decision,  by offering £150 compensation, means I 
accept PayPal are liable for these transactions. Because of this, they feel PayPal should 
reimburse them the almost £5,000 they lost.
PayPal have said they dont agree they should pay Company A £150 for the inconvenience 
of not knowing  what wouldve  happened if 3D Secure had been in place, because it cant  be 
determined if 3D Secure  wouldve  stopped  the transactions and subsequent  chargebacks.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive responded to the points raised by 
Company A and PayPal below.
Ref: DRN10030312chargebacks
As I said in my provisional decision,  3D Secure  adds an additional layer of security on some  
card transactions  but it doesnt stop customers from making chargeback requests. I 
havent seen anything to show me that, had 3D Secure  been  in place, then the transactions 
that resulted in chargeback requests wouldve definitely failed the additional layer of security  
3D Secure provides.  Because of this I cant say that, even with 3D Secure in place, 
chargeback requests wouldnt  have been made.
Chargebacks arent guaranteed and Company A were able to challenge these requests. 
But because the challenges were unsuccessful,  Company As bank has refunded almost 
£5,000. For the reasons above  I remain satisfied that PayPal cant  be held responsible  for 
the successful  chargebacks, and Company As comments dont change my view. So I wont 
be asking PayPal to reimburse Company A almost £5,000.
compensation for inconvenience
Its not disputed  that PayPal  didnt tell Company A about 3D Secure, and its clear from 
Company As comments that they believe  the chargeback transactions  wouldnt have 
happened if 3D Secure had been  in place. While, for the reasons already given, 3D Secure 
wouldnt have stopped a chargeback being made, it may have stopped  a transaction  from 
going through in the first place. This is something Company A will never know  and I feel that 
PayPal should  compensate them for the inconvenience  of their not knowing and as they 
have spent a considerable amount of time attributing their loss to the lack of a secure 
platform.
Company A dont  think £150 adequately compensates  them  for the £5,000 theyve lost, but 
as Ive said wont be asking PayPal to reimburse the value of the chargebacks. In my 
provisional decision I considered £150 to be fair, and the comments  Ive received dont 
change my view on this. 
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above I uphold Company As complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA must pay Company A £150 to compensation for the inconvenience  resulting from 
them not being advised about 3D Secure when they signed up for PayPals services.

complaint
Company A is a business that sells goods online. They use PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
process their online payments. Company A has complained that PayPal will not reimburse them  
almost £5000 - the value  of chargebacks applied to their account. 
background
Mr M and his son are directors of Company A. After  bring  contacted  by PayPal they agreed to use 
them as the payment portal on Company  As website. A number of successful chargebacks have 
been made by customers claiming that they didnt authorise payment to Company A.
Company A has complained  that PayPal didnt tell them they needed to register for 3D Secure, 
which wouldve meant these  chargebacks wouldnt have happened. Because  of this they want  PayPal 
to reimburse the value  of the chargebacks.
Our investigator found that PayPal hadnt  acted  reasonably. She felt that having protection against 
fraudulent transactions was important to Company A, and PayPal hadnt told them  about  3D Secure 
when they signed up for PayPals payment portal. She thought it was likely that Company A wouldve 
signed up for 3D Secure  earlier, had they known about it, and felt this wouldve protected them 
against the chargebacks. Because of this she recommended  that PayPal reimburse Company  A for 
the chargebacks  and any associated charges.
PayPal didnt  agree with the investigator. Theyve said chargebacks are a risk associated with 
accepting card payments, and its crucial to have sufficient fraud filters in place to prevent potential  
losses through fraudulent activity. PayPal feel its Company  As responsibility  to ensure  these filters 
are in place,  and that they cant be held responsible  if they dont.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
When goods or services  are purchased using a card, theres  some consumer protection  in place. If 
the goods  or services  were  not supplied, or if the customer didnt authorise the payment in the first 
place, they can ask their card provider  to refund the money. This is called  a chargeback and its dealt 
with by the card providers,  not by payment  portal providers such as PayPal. A chargeback is not 
guaranteed and there is a process in place that allows  businesses such as Company A to challenge  
the request.
Company A received a number  of chargeback  requests from customers claiming not to have 
authorised payments. Ive seen from the evidence that Company A challenged these requests,  but 
these challenges were unsuccessful. Because of this their bank has refunded almost £5,000 to 
customers Company  A say theyve sent goods to.
PayPal offers seller protection, and may reimburse a seller for a chargeback where this results from 
an unauthorised payment. But this protection doesnt cover payments  made through  the payment 
portal they supplied to Company A. This was made  clear  in the online user agreement  Company A 
accepted when they signed up with PayPal.
As a PayPal customer, Company A was also eligible for 3D Secure.  PayPals  website confirms  this 
adds an additional  level of card payment security  on some  transactions   either  when a card is 
registered for use with PayPal or if the transaction is considered to be risky.  This security process and 
what is or isnt a risky transaction is determined by the card issuer and not PayPal.
Ref: DRN10030314Its not disputed that PayPal didnt tell Company A about 3D Secure when they signed up for their 
service, and I agree  that its likely Company A wouldve registered for this at the outset had they 
known about it. But I dont think this means PayPal should reimburse  Company A for the value of the 
chargebacks.
3D Secure wouldve added  an additional layer of security on some transactions. Ive not seen 
anything to show  that the chargeback transactions would definitely have had this additional  level of 
security applied,  or that the customers would  definitely have failed this check had it been in place. For 
that reason I cant say that not having 3D Secure  was the only reason why the transactions, and 
subsequent chargebacks, were successful. Because of this it wouldnt be fair to ask PayPal to 
reimburse Company A almost £5,000.
I can see that Company A have been inconvenienced by what has happened  this is money  they 
cant afford to lose. They will never know if having 3D Secure would have stopped any of the 
transactions from being approved, which wouldve  reduced  the financial impact to them. I feel its fair 
that PayPal  should compensate Company  A for the inconvenience of their not knowing if any of 
transactions couldve  been  stopped had 3D Secure been in place. I consider  £150 is fair in the 
circumstances.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  pay Company A £150 to 
compensation for the inconvenience resulting  from them not being  advised about 3D Secure when 
they signed  up for PayPals services.
