Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ts complaint in part and thought loans 6 to 25 should not have 
been given. Sunny made an offer for loans 13 to 25. Mr T didnt accept this offer. So the 
case has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
    the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
    the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Mr T hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 5 so I wont be looking at 
these any further as there is no ongoing disagreement about them. But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ts other lending. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
    At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr Ts overall pattern of borrowing suggested that he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr T had taken out six loans within seven 
months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr T was having 
to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
    Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out 31 months after Mr Ts first. While the loan amounts fluctuated over time, 
they didnt decrease. Mr T was often paying for a number of loans with Sunny at the 
same time. Mr T had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
    these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.    the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him/her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 25 and Sunny should put things right.
 
Putting things right
    refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans 6 to 25;
    pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement;
    the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 25 should be removed from    Mr Ts credit 
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limit should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2020.
