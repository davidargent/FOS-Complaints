K821x#15complaint
Mrs F says Elevate  Credit  International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about 36 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mrs F between  June  2015  
and January 2018. Mrs Fs borrowing history is summarised at the end of this decision.  
Loans 35 and 36 had an outstanding balance at the time of this decision. 
Two of our adjudicators have reviewed  Mrs Fs case. The first adjudicator  partially upheld  
Mrs Fs complaint and thought the loans  from loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been  given  
because it looked  like Mrs F was struggling financially and the pattern of her borrowing 
indicated she was reliant on these types of loans. Sunny  disagreed and offered to uphold  
Mrs Fs complaint about loans 11 to 36. Mrs F didnt accept Sunnys  offer.
The second  adjudicator thought Sunny had done  enough when it lent Mrs F loans 1 to 9 but 
they upheld Mrs Fs complaint about loan 10 onwards.  Sunny didnt respond  to this view.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me to issue my decision 
on it. I issued my provisional decision in April 2020  and explained that I was also partly 
upholding Mrs Fs complaint but for different reasons. Heres what  I said:
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mrs F could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  consider  several different things,  such as how much 
was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mrs F 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and 
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
Ref: DRN88577572commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context and 
what this all means for Mrs Fs complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided to partially uphold  the 
complaint. 
Mrs F didnt respond  to either of the adjudicators  views about the loans they thought werent  mis-sold 
by Sunny. Neither of our adjudicators thought Sunny had done anything  wrong when  it lent Mrs F 
loans 1 to 4. As there has been no further dispute about loans, Ive focussed  my decision on the loans 
still in dispute. 
The second  adjudicator didnt think Sunny had done anything  wrong when  it sold loans 5 to 9 to Mrs F 
either. And I agree with their rational for loans 5 to 7 so I wont making  any further findings on these 
three loans.  But I think Sunny shouldve  done more  before it sold loan 8 to Mrs F. Ill explain  why. 
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 8 to Mrs F and the results of these checks didnt  
raise any concerns. But this was Mrs Fs eighth loan in less than six months,  so I think  Sunny 
shouldve been looking  to build a clear picture than it did about Mrs Fs finances before  lending her 
this loan. 
Had Sunny  carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 8, its likely to have found that Mrs F 
couldnt afford  to sustainably make the repayments for this loan because she didnt have  the 
disposable income  to cover the combined repayment for this loan and her other outstanding loan. At 
the time she took out loan 8, Mrs F still had loan 7 outstanding  which  had been her largest loan 
amount to date. Her declared  income  at this time was £2,400 and her stated outgoings  were £2,140.  
This left her with a disposable income of £260. The combined monthly  repayment for loan 7 and 8 
was £338.30. The repayment of this amount would have left her in minus  figures and would have 
increased the likelihood of her having to borrow again. I think this was shown when  she borrowed 
again from Sunny just over three  weeks later.  
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs F, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mrs Fs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 10 I say this 
because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mrs F was not managing to repay  her loans 
sustainably. Mrs F had taken out ten loans within nine months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mrs F was having to borrow  further to cover the hole 
repaying her previous loan was leaving  in her finances and that      Mrs Fs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Fs first loan was for £200 and loan 10 was for £950.  Sunny ought to have known  that it 
was unlikely that Mrs F was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in her income but more to 
meet an ongoing need. 
Mrs F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 36 was taken out 
over two and a half years after Mrs Fs first. And it was for a much larger amount. Mrs F had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN88577573I think  that Mrs F lost out because  Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mrs Fs indebtedness  by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Mrs F borrowed was likely  to have had 
negative implications  on Mrs Fs ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8 and 9 and loans 10 to 36 and Sunny should put 
things right.
Mrs F responded and accepted my provisional findings, but we didnt hear back  from Sunny.  
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
As no one has given me anything to consider, my decision remains  the same  Im 
upholding the complaint  about loans 8 and 9 and loans 10 to 23 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mrs F towards interest,  
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mrs F which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs F originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mrs F as though they had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mrs F having  made  
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mrs F. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs F. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
Ref: DRN88577574E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mrs Fs credit file in relation 
to loans 8 and 9. The overall pattern of Mrs Fs borrowing for loans 10 to 36 means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans  entirely 
from Mrs Fs credit file. Sunny does not have  to remove  any outstanding loans from Mrs Fs 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse  
information recorded about these  loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mrs F a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before  21  June  2020.
