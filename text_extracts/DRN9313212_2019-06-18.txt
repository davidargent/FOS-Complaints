K821x#15complaint
Miss T says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket lent to her 
irresponsibly.
background
Miss T had 26 payday loans with QuickQuid, approved between September  2010 and June 
2013. Miss T also took out an instalment loan with Pounds to Pocket  in January 2013. 
Miss T has withdrawn her complaint about  loans 1-9 as the business objected  to this service  
considering them given the time that has passed.  The business has agreed to refund all 
interest and charges on the QuickQuid loans  15 to 26. So I am only looking at the QuickQuid 
loans numbered 10-14  and the Pounds to Pocket  instalment loan.  I may refer to the earlier 
loans in my findings  when  necessary.
An adjudicator has looked at Miss Ts complaint and recommended it be upheld. He thought  
that by the time of loan 10, QuickQuid ought to have realised that further lending wouldve 
been unsustainable or otherwise harmful for Miss T. QuickQuid didnt agree, so the 
complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Miss Ts case.
Ive decided to uphold Miss Ts complaint  about  loans 10-14  and the instalment loan and 
have explained  why below.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss T 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Ts income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN93132122So, taking into account the short-term purpose  of the loans provided, Ive thought about 
whether the overall pattern of lending increased  Miss Ts indebtedness  in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
With this is mind, Ive looked  at the pattern of lending in Miss Ts case to see if there  was a 
point at which CashEuroNet should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think that this point had been reached  
by loan 10. (Its possible it was reached  before this point, but those loans do not form part of 
this complaint.)
I think this point had been reached by loan 10 because:
the amounts  Miss T was borrowing were  not generally decreasing, and CashEuroNet 
ought to have realised it was likely  she was not settling her debts sustainably.
Miss T wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed CashEuroNet   she 
continued to borrow  similar amounts, without any significant break between her loans 
until eventually she was unable  to pay back what she had borrowed.
I think that Miss T lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 
10 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ts 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Miss Ts complaint about  loans  10 to 14 and the instalment loan because  
the overall pattern of lending increased  her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful and she lost out as a result.
Id like to make it clear I have considered the points  CashEuroNet raised in response to the 
adjudicator. Essentially, it has said it doesnt think that a pattern of lending alone  is enough  
to establish that the loans were unsustainable  or otherwise harmful  for Miss T. In making  its 
points, it referred to the current regulators sourcebook for consumer credit,  known as 
CONC.
But CONC isnt really  relevant to this complaint. CONC came  into force on 1 April 2014 and 
while Miss T did still have an outstanding balance with QuickQuid at this point, she hadnt 
borrowed anything from QuickQuid since June 2013. So no lending took place under CONC. 
The regulator at the time the loans  were approved was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)  
which had provided  guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). As Ive mentioned above, this 
services approach to short-term lending is set out on our website, so I wont  cite all the 
relevant rules and regulations here.
The ILG says (at paragraph 6.25)  unfair and/or deceptive practices include:
Ref: DRN93132123Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's existing credit commitment  for a short-
term credit  product in a way that is unsustainable  or otherwise harmful.
And that this includes:
allowing a borrower to sequentially  enter into a number of separate agreements for 
short-term loan products, one after another, where the overall effect  is to increase  the 
borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable manner.
And that payday  loans:
are not appropriate for supporting sustained borrowing over longer  periods
The above is reflected on QuickQuids website, which  says:
Short-term loans should be used for short-term financial needs only,  and not as long-term 
financial solution. As a responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent use of our 
service.
With this (and our Services published  approach  and previous decisions) in mind I dont 
agree that a pattern of lending isnt, in some  circumstances, enough on its own to indicate 
that further lending would  be unsustainable  or otherwise harmful.  As I have  said, Miss T 
borrowed from CashEuroNet with no significant  break for nearly three years.  I dont think  that 
can reasonably  be described as a short-term relationship and at some point, CashEuroNet 
ought to have realised it wasnt fair to continue lending to Miss T. For the reasons Ive given 
above, I think this point came at loan 10 taken out in February 2012.
So Im upholding  Miss Ts complaint about  loan 10 to 14 and the instalment loan taken out in 
January 2013  as this came after the point at which CashEuroNet should have realised 
further lending  was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
putting things right
CashEuroNet must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss T paid on loan 10 to 14 and the instalment loan 
in addition to its offer in relation to loans 15 to 26.
pay interest on the above  at 8% simple per year, from when they were  paid until the 
date of settlement
remove all entries about  the above  loans from Miss Ts credit file
CashEuroNet can use the refund  to clear any outstanding balance
HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet  to take off tax from this interest.  CashEuroNet must 
give Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Ref: DRN93132124Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 July 2019.
