The complaint
Mrs M complains about some furniture that she paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Hitachi Capital (UK) plc, trading as Hitachi Personal Finance. Mrs Ms husband is also 
involved with her complaint. 
What happened
Mrs M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Personal Finance that she 
signed in January 2020 to pay for some furniture. She complained to the retailer about some 
issues with the furniture and then complained to Hitachi Personal Finance. It didnt uphold 
her complaint so she complained to this service and she stopped making the loan 
repayments to Hitachi Personal Finance.
The retailer then agreed that Mrs M could return the furniture and it was collected from her. 
Hitachi Personal Finance says that the retailer cancelled the finance and that it would 
remove the agreement from her credit file.
Our investigator recommended that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld. He said that 
reasonable efforts had been made to put Mrs M back in the position she would have been in 
if there was no breach of contract but he thought that the situation was prolonged 
unnecessarily which had caused more distress to Mrs M. He recommended that Hitachi 
Personal Finance should pay £150 to Mrs M to compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience that shed been caused.
Hitachi Personal Finance has accepted that recommendation but Mrs Ms husband, on her 
behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that Mrs M 
should receive at least £400 compensation and he wants Hitachi Personal Finance to be 
punished for the distress and inconvenience that its caused to Mrs M. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the furniture has been collected from Mrs M and Hitachi Personal Finance says that 
the retailer has cancelled the finance and that it would remove the agreement from 
her credit file;
I consider that to be fair and reasonable and the only outstanding issue is the amount 
of compensation that should be paid to Mrs M;
Hitachi Personal Finance has accepted our investigators recommendation that it 
should pay Mrs M £150 compensation;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  but we have no regulatory or disciplinary role over 
those businesses and our role isnt to punish a business if its done something wrong;
in certain circumstances, Hitachi Personal Finance, as the provider of the loan, is 
jointly liable with the retailer for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
retailer - and this service can also award compensation for any distress and 
inconvenience caused by Hitachi Personal Finance in responding to Mrs Ms 
complaint  but not for the distress and inconvenience caused by the retailers 
breach of contract or misrepresentation;
I consider that Hitachi Personal Finance has caused avoidable distress and 
inconvenience for Mrs M as I dont consider that it properly responded to her 
complaint when it arranged for the quality of the furniture to be inspected and it hasnt 
provided Mrs M with information that shes asked for as quickly as I consider that it 
should have done;
Mrs M didnt make all of the loan repayments that were due under the agreement to 
Hitachi Personal Finance so it issued a default notice to her and recorded adverse 
information on her credit file  it has now said that it will remove the agreement from 
her credit file but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require it to pay any compensation to Mrs M for the distress and inconvenience that 
she was caused by its response to the missed payments, including the default notice 
and the adverse information; and
I agree with the investigator that £150 is fair and reasonable compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience that Hitachi Personal Finance has caused Mrs M and Im 
not persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified in these 
circumstances.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Hitachi Personal Finance to pay £150 to Mrs M 
to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused  but Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint and I order Hitachi Capital (UK) plc, trading 
as Hitachi Personal Finance, to pay £150 to Mrs M to compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience that shes been caused.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2021.
