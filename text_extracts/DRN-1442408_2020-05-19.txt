The complaint
Miss T complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her.
Background
Miss T was given 15 instalment loans by Sunny between September 2014 and April 2019. A 
summary of her borrowing is as follows:

At the time of writing this decision, there remains an outstanding balance on loans 13 to 15. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny had been wrong to give loans 1 to 6 and 13 to 15 to    
 Miss T. But they didnt think Sunny should have agreed to lend from loan 7 to 12 as it was 
apparent from the pattern of Miss Ts borrowing that she was reliant on the short-term loans 
and was unlikely to sustainably repay the amounts borrowed. 
Sunny disagreed and said the pattern indicated Miss T was borrowing as and when she 
needed funds. It also explained it carried out checks on Miss T each time she applied for a 
loan. These checks included affordability checks and reviewing information from credit 
reports. But it did offer to uphold loans 10 to 12. This offer was put to Miss T, but she 
rejected it. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has passed to me. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Miss T 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
There were significant breaks in Miss Ts borrowing from Sunny. There was a gap of over a 
year between loan 1 and loan 2. And there was a further gap of around 14 months between 
loans 12 and 13. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view these gaps as an indication 
that Miss Ts finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances were that had caused 
her to take out the loans. So, I will look at Miss Ts borrowing in three separate lending 
chains. 
The first chain was made up of solely loan 1, the second chain was made up of loans 2 to 12 
and the third chain was loans 13 to 15. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more before it lent Miss T loans 1 to 6 and 
13 to 15. Miss T hasnt disagreed, so I wont be making any further findings on these loans 
because they no longer appear to be in dispute. But Ive kept these loans in mind when 
thinking about the overall borrowing relationship between Miss T and Sunny. 
Having carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ts complaint, Im partly upholding the complaint. Ill 
explain why. 
Chain two  loans 2 to 12
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss T, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss T was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. In this chain, Miss T had taken out six loans within nine months. 
So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss T was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From loan 7 to loan 12 Miss T was provided with a new loan within weeks  
sometimes days - of taking out a previous one. 
Miss T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out ten months after Miss Ts first. Miss T had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 to loan 
12 because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans Miss T borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
Miss Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 12 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 7 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 to loan 12 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about these loans (7 to 12) should be removed 
from Miss Ts credit file;
if there is still an outstanding balance then the amount refunded should be used to 
repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, this 
should be repaid to Miss T. However, if there is still an outstanding balance, then 
Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss T. 
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2020.
