K820x#14complaint
Mrs M complains that Virgin Money  plc doesnt include her title on its statements.
background
Virgin Money doesnt include Mrs Ms title on her statements. Mrs M considers the absence  
of her title means Virgin Money is addressing her as a man.  
Our investigator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
Virgin Money was able to decide the format  of its statements,  and this wasnt something  this 
service could interfere  with.
Mrs M disagreed with the investigators conclusions, so the complaint has been passed to 
me.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought carefully about everything Mrs M has said, and Ive listened to her recent phone 
call with this service. I can see that the fact that Virgin  Money doesnt include Mrs Ms title on 
its statements is upsetting  for her.
But it is beyond the remit of this service to tell Virgin Money how to format customer  names. 
So I cannot compel Virgin Money  to use Mrs Ms title as she would like.
I realise that my decision is likely to be disappointing  for Mrs M.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.
