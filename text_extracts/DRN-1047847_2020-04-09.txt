The complaint
Mr L complains that, despite being sent an invitation, he wasn't eligible to join Marks and 
Spencer Financial Services Plc's (M&S Bank) Premium Club because he isn't a credit card 
customer. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
M&S Bank apologised for sending Mr L a promotion relating to a club hes not eligible 
to join in its final response dated 28 February 2019. M&S Bank paid Mr L £35. Im 
satisfied the £35 settlement and apology fairly reflects the impact of being sent the 
promotional literature. 
The Premium Club terms and conditions say customers must have a M&S Bank 
credit card to join. As Mr L isnt a M&S Bank credit card customer he isn't eligible to 
take up Premium Club Membership.
To qualify for Premium Club Membership Mr L will need to be a M&S Bank credit 
card holder. To obtain a M&S Bank credit card Mr L will need to go through the 
application process.
Whilst M&S Bank has previously agreed to transfer charge card customers to a credit 
card, it has confirmed that service is no longer available. M&S Bank is free to decide 
how customers apply for its products. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 May 2020.
