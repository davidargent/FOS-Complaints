K820x#14Complaint
Miss H complains that National Westminster Bank Plcs online and mobile  banking  services 
dont give clear and correct information  about  her bank account. 
Background
Miss H has a bank account with NatWest and uses its online and mobile banking facilities  to 
check her account. Shes raised a number of complaints about the services  NatWest 
provides, going  back to 2014. Miss H says that the information given in the mobile app and 
online banking doesnt allow her to keep track of the movements in her account which  has 
led to her incurring  bank charges. 
NatWest has explained  that pending transactions arent always  paid in real time which  
means the available balance  is liable  to change. NatWest  also advises that its online and 
mobile banking  services are improving  and becoming more comprehensive as they are 
developed further. NatWest didnt  uphold Miss Hs complaint.  
Miss H referred her concerns to our service and they were passed to an investigator. The 
investigator didnt  uphold the complaint and said we cant tell a business  how to operate  or 
what its online and mobile banking facilities should  look like. Miss H didnt accept and said 
the information NatWest gives doesnt allow her to make informed decisions about her 
account. As Miss H didnt  accept the investigators view her complaint  has been passed  to 
me to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive been reasonably brief above  as 
Miss H and NatWest have both provided detailed submissions for me to look at. In response  
to the investigator, Miss H has provided links to the Financial Conduct Authority rules  that 
govern how businesses operate and explained why she feels  NatWests system doesnt 
work for her. 
Whilst Ive read and considered everything Miss H has said and provided, Im not going  to 
comment on all of the points shes raised.  My decision will focus on what  I feel are the key 
issues. I hope Miss H wont take that as a discourtesy,  it simply reflects the informal  nature 
of this service. 
Miss H says that the information NatWest provides means its not possible for her to 
efficiently run her account. I accept  that there are limits to the online and mobile banking 
services it offers but NatWest has explained  that its impossible to update Miss Hs account 
in real time for a number  of reasons  and I think thats a reasonable point. 
NatWest says that transactions arent always debited  by merchants as they happen. So the 
available balance can change. Miss H says the available balance  only shows at Â£0 when 
shes spent more than the available balance.  But thats correct as she wouldnt be able to 
spend further on the account at that time.  Miss H says that the available balances dont 
update throughout the day in the same way as other banks operate.  But businesses are free 
to decide how to operate and what type of service to provide. 
Ref: DRN73650442Im sorry  to disappoint Miss H as I can see how strongly she feels. But I dont agree that 
NatWests online and mobile banking services provide misleading or unclear information.  I 
agree there are limits  to the information  NatWest  provides but it has given Miss H a clear 
explanation of the different services  it offers. NatWest  has also explained  that its systems 
are regularly improved  and updated. As a service,  we cant tell NatWest how to operate or 
how its online and mobile banking systems  should work  those  are commercial decisions its 
entitled to take.  
Miss H says shes  incurred bank charges because the information NatWest gives  her isnt 
clear enough. As Ive said above,  Im satisfied NatWests  systems  are sufficiently clear. I 
also have to take into account  that there are other options open to Miss H if she wants to 
check how her account is operating, like telephone banking, visiting a branch or looking at 
statements. Im not persuaded that the issues Miss H has raised were the cause of the bank 
charges shes raised. 
I havent been persuaded that the information NatWest  provides is unclear or misleading and 
I cant tell NatWest how to operate its online and mobile banking  services. As a result, Im 
not upholding this complaint. As Im satisfied NatWest has dealt with Miss Hs complaint 
fairly Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 January 2020.
