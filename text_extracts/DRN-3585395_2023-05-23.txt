The complaint
Mr P complains that American Express Services Europe Limited, trading as American 
Express, wont refund to him the payment that he and his wife made for a holiday product. 
Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr P and his wife agreed to purchase lodging rights and services for a suite and a junior 
suite at a vacation club in March 2013 and Mr P made a down-payment of £5,148.87 using 
his American Express credit card. Mr P sent an e-mail to the holiday company at the end of 
that month in which he said that he was unable to proceed further with the purchase of the 
vacation weeks and wished to rescind and be released from the agreement. 
The holiday company offered him some options and Mr P agreed in May 2013 to go ahead 
with an alternative junior suite. He paid a further £2,650.44 to the holiday company in July 
2013 using his American Express credit card. 
Mr Ps representative made a claim to American Express in June 2018 under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for a refund of the down-payment of £5,148.87 that Mr P had 
made because the holiday product had been misrepresented to Mr P and his wife. American 
Express said that it was unable to uphold Mr Ps claim and it set out its reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. Mr P wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the 
contract to Mr P and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that American Express decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. 
She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt 
think that the holiday company had breached the contract that Mr P had agreed with it.
Mr Ps representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
our investigators recommendations dont take into consideration any of the 
regulations applicable to a contract of this nature;
Mr P and his wife provided the holiday company with notice that they wished to 
cancel the contract within the cancellation period of five working days from the 
delivery, or the signing, of the contract;
the holiday product that Mr P and his wife received didnt contain the same quality 
and specifications offered to them at the sales presentation and/or listed in the 
contract;
Mr P and his wife purchased the suite and junior suite timeshare weeks as an 
investment that would provide a 20% return because they believed the salespeoples 
claims that the units would rent out easily at the rate of US$3,200 each week and 
they were provided with a list of brokers who rent out the units; and 
Mr P and his wife had the right to receive sufficient and truthful information about the 
products acquired but that didnt happen.
Mr P has provided a statement in support of his claim in which he describes the way that the 
holiday product was sold to him and his wife.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ps complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ps claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ps claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the holiday product was misrepresented to him and his wife and 
that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not American Express response to 
Mr Ps claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ps complaint form says that the holiday company breached the EU Timeshare 
Directive  but neither the holiday company nor the holiday product is based in the 
EU so I dont consider that the EU Timeshare Directive would be applicable in these 
circumstances;
Mr Ps complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mr P and his wife and his representatives letter to 
American Express in June 2018 describes the misrepresentations that it says were 
made to Mr P and his wife, including:
they had five working days from the delivery, or signing, of the contract to 
cancel it;
the vacation package that they received didnt contain the same quality and 
specifications offered to them at the sales presentation and/or listed in the 
contract;
they purchased the timeshare weeks in the suite and junior suite as an 
investment that would provide a 20% return, because they believed the 
salespeoples claims that the units would rent out easily at the rate of 
US$3,200 each week and they were provided with a list of brokers who rent 
out the units; and
the vacation package contains terms and conditions that werent previously 
disclosed verbally or in writing;
Mr P and his wife had signed documents in March 2013 for their purchase of lodging 
rights and services for a suite and a junior suite at the vacation club  the total price 
payable for their suite and junior suite was US$29,715 and Mr P had made a down-
payment of US$7,429 (£5,148.87) so the balance due from them was US$22,286;Mr P sent an e-mail to the holiday company at the end of that month in which he said 
that he was unable to proceed further with the purchase of the vacation weeks and 
wished to rescind and be released from the agreement; 
the holiday company offered him some options and Mr P agreed in May 2013 to go 
ahead with an alternative junior suite  Mr Ps representative has provided unsigned 
documents dated May 2013 for the purchase of lodging rights and services for the 
alternative junior suite at the vacation club - the total price payable for that junior 
suite was US$11,468, less the down-payment that Mr P had made so the balance 
due from Mr P and his wife was US$4,039  Mr P paid US$4,039 (£2,650.44) to the 
holiday company in July 2013 using his American Express credit card;
Mr P said in his e-mail to the holiday company at the end of March 2013: We realise 
that the 5 day period for withdrawing is passed but we were unaware of the above 
until our return home and I have advised you as soon as possible  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr P and his wife had more than five working days from the 
date that they signed the agreement in March 2013 to cancel it and that period had 
ended before Mr P sent his e-mail to the holiday company;
Mr P and his wife had agreed to buy rights to the alternative junior suite (and not the 
suite and junior suite that was the subject of the documents that theyd signed) so the 
vacation package that they received wasnt the same as the vacation package 
offered to them at the sales presentation and/or listed in the contract and I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect that the quality and specification would be 
different and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the quality 
and specification of the alternative junior suite was misrepresented to them;
the purchase agreement that Mr P and his wife signed said: Membership is intended 
for the use and enjoyment of Member, not for rental, resale or investment; and the 
declaration that they signed said: The [holiday company] will not rent or resell my 
weeks. The [holiday company] makes no representations about vacation ownership 
rentals, resales or their value as an investment and does not in any manner 
recommend purchasing vacation ownership for any rental, resale or investment 
purpose;
Mr P says in his statement that he and his wife were given an indication of the likely 
rent per week and that they were provided with a list of vacation ownership rental and 
resale companies but that they began to have misgivings about the rental process 
when they were required to pay an upfront fee to one of those companies and it 
wasnt very efficient and it achieved no rental during the four years that it was 
involved;
Mr Ps representative says that Mr P and his wife were told that their investment 
would provide a 20% return and would easily rent out at the rate of US$3,200 each 
week  but they had agreed in the documents that theyd signed that their purchase 
wasnt an investment and Ive seen no other evidence to support the claim that they 
were told that they would be able to rent out the suite and junior suite for US$3,200 
each week;
Mr P and his wife had agreed to buy rights to a suite and a junior suite but they 
bought rights to an alternative junior suite and Im not persuaded that its likely that 
they would have been told that theyd be able to rent out the alternative junior suite 
for US$3,200 each week;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday product was 
misrepresented to Mr P and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement to buy the holiday product by any 
such misrepresentations;Mr Ps representative has provided the documents that were signed by Mr P and his 
wife in March 2013 and also the unsigned documents dated in May 2013 relating to 
the alternative junior suite and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show the vacation package contains terms and conditions that werent previously 
disclosed verbally or in writing or that the holiday company has breached the 
agreements;
I sympathise with Mr P and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
product but I consider that American Express response to their section 75 claim was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require American Express to 
refund to Mr P any of the money that he and his wife paid for the holiday product, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2023.
