Complaint
Mr B is unhappy with the way PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handled a dispute about an 
item he sold.   
Background
In August 2020, Mr B agreed to sell a pair of trainers using an online platform. Hed 
managed to buy the trainers direct from the manufacturer. He paid £89.95, but this particular 
pair was highly sought after. On the secondary market, it can command a price of between 
£1,000 and £2,000. 
He agreed a price of £1,350 with his prospective buyer. The buyer paid him via PayPal and 
Mr B duly dispatched the trainers. A short while later, the buyer said that he was unhappy 
with them. He was certain that they were fake and claimed to have had this verified by taking 
them into one of the manufacturers stores.
He told PayPal that hed return the trainers to Mr B and raised a dispute about the payment. 
PayPal agreed to refund the £1,350 to Mr Bs buyer which left his PayPal account 
overdrawn. Mr B says that, when he received a parcel from the buyer, the trainers that had 
been returned to him were not the same ones that hed sent.
Mr B sent photographs to PayPal of the trainers that were returned to him as part of his 
appeal against the original decision. PayPal rejected his appeal saying that the damage 
noted in your appeal was cited by your buyer as the reason for the complaint. In essence, 
PayPal said that both Mr B and his buyer had said that the trainers were fakes  only they 
were referring (according to Mr B) to two different pairs of trainers. 
PayPal also said that Mr B had needed to report the dispute to the police. He sent PayPal a 
screenshot showing that hed made a submission on the website of his local police force, but 
PayPal wasnt satisfied that this demonstrated that hed informed the police of this dispute  
it simply showed that hed made a submission of some kind but that its contents were a 
mystery.
PayPal thought it was right to have rejected Mr Bs appeal and his subsequent complaint. Mr 
B was unhappy with the response. He referred a complaint to this service. It was looked at 
by an Investigator who upheld it. The Investigator said that it wasnt straightforward to 
determine what had happened here. But she was satisfied that the trainers Mr B sent and 
the ones he received werent the same. She was also satisfied that hed followed all the 
procedural steps required by PayPal, such as notifying the police. 
She considered that the PayPal employee who had handled Mr Bs claim hadnt really 
understood the nature of the dispute. Mr Bs buyer had said that the trainers supplied were 
fake and when Mr B lodged his appeal, he said that the trainers returned to him were fake. 
PayPal said that his appeal couldnt succeed because both he and the buyer had made the 
same complaint. As a result, it didnt ask Mr B to provide any evidence to support his claim. 
She thought PayPal should fairly and reasonably be expected to reimburse Mr B the price of 
£1,350.
The Investigator also thought the way that PayPal handled its interactions with Mr B had led 
to unnecessary delays and frustration. This had caused Mr B some distress and 
inconvenience  she thought PayPal should pay £150 in recognition of that.
PayPal disagreed with the investigators opinion. It said everything it did was consistent with 
the content of its user agreement and that it had considered all the evidence submitted by 
both sides. It said that it wasnt sure Mr B had notified the police  the screenshot hed sent 
simply showed that hed submitted something to the police, but it didnt say what the 
contents were. As PayPal disagreed with the Investigators opinion, the complaint has been 
passed to me to consider and issue a final decision.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The relationship between Mr B and PayPal is governed by the terms of the PayPal user 
agreement. That gives PayPal a very broad discretion to resolve disputes such as this one. 
However, my role is to consider whether the way PayPal has exercised that discretion is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances. And having done so, Im not satisfied that it was. As 
a result, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint and asking PayPal to pay him compensation.
This isnt a straightforward case, because the evidence is limited. I cannot know with 
complete certainty which pair of trainers were placed in the package that Mr B dispatched to 
his buyer and which ones he received back. In such circumstances, I must decide the case 
on the balance of probabilities. And overall, Im satisfied that the weight of the evidence 
supports the position that Mr B sent an authentic pair of trainers to his buyer but did not 
receive the same pair in return. 
Ive come to that conclusion because:
Mr B has shown us two confirmatory emails showing his purchase of an authentic 
pair of these trainers direct from the manufacturer and showing the price he paid for 
them.
Hes sent us photographs which he says are of the pair he sent to the buyer and the 
pair he received back. In addition, hes shown us a copy of the photograph that was 
displayed with the original advert for the trainers to confirm what the authentic pair 
were supposed to look like. Part of the trainers material has a cow skin pattern 
making it very straightforward to spot discrepancies between the two pairs.
Im satisfied that its likely he did notify his local police force and Action Fraud as to 
what had happened. The fact that this hasnt resulted in meaningful action which 
might have allowed him to provide PayPal with a detailed police report isnt 
surprising, nor do I think its something that shouldve counted against Mr B when his 
complaint was considered.
PayPal is right that this doesnt prove beyond all doubt that events transpired as Mr B has 
claimed, but for the reasons Ive explained, Im satisfied that the weight of the evidence 
supports the version of events hes told us.
Distress and Inconvenience
 I agree with the Investigator that the way PayPal handled Mr Bs dispute caused him some 
distress and inconvenience. I think there was clearly a misunderstanding on PayPals part in assuming that Mr B was complaining for the same reason as the buyer and therefore 
rejecting his appeal by default. I think if Mr B had been asked for evidence to support his 
case, its likely hed have provided PayPal with the evidence hes provided to this service  
which might have eliminated the lengthy delays he did experience.
Overall, Im satisfied that £150 represents fair compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience that was caused to Mr B.
Final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold this complaint.
If Mr B accepts my final decision, PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA needs to:
Refund Mr B the sum of £1,350 to Mr Bs account. It will need to add 8% simple 
interest per annum to this sum from the date it deducted it from his account until the 
date the settlement is paid.
Pay Mr B £150 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience he has been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2021.
