The complaint
Mrs L complains that Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Ltd mishandled her claim on a motor 
insurance policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a luxury sports utility vehicle with a large 
engine and first registered in September 2019.
By late January 2021 (the date of its most recent V5 registration document), Mrs L had 
acquired the vehicle on a finance agreement. She agreed to pay instalments to the finance 
company of £1,176.33 on the 12th day of each month.
For the year from mid-January 2022, Mrs L had the vehicle insured on a comprehensive 
policy with Admiral. Any claim for theft was subject to an excess of £500.00.
In late September 2022, the vehicle passed an MOT test with a recorded mileage of about 
12,500.
In mid-October 2022, Mrs L added a named driver.
In early November 2022 , Mrs L reported that someone had stolen the vehicle.
In mid-January 2023, Admiral said it was investigating the circumstances of the theft. Mrs L 
engaged solicitors to assist her.
On about 4 February 2023, Mrs L provided CCTV footage of the theft.
On about 2 March 2023, Admiral decided that the pre-theft value of the vehicle was about 
£84,600.00. Admiral understood that the balance due for settlement of the finance 
agreement was about £61,000.00. Admiral paid Mrs L about £20,000.00.
On about 12 March 2023, Mrs L paid the finance company £1,176.33.
By mid-March 2023. Mrs L had (through the solicitors) complained to Admiral about delay in 
dealing with her claim and paying the finance company.
On about 5 April 2023, Admiral said that the balance due for settlement of the finance 
agreement was about £62,500.00.
On about 7 April 2023, Admiral reimbursed Mrs L £1,176.33.
On about 12 April 2023, Mrs L paid the Mrs finance company £1,176.33.
On about 24 April 2023, Mrs Ls solicitors reminded Admiral that it hadnt paid the finance 
company.
On about 27 April 2023, Admiral reimbursed Mrs L £1,176.33. By late April or early May 
2023, Admiral paid the finance company about £61,000.00 in settlement of the finance 
agreement.
By a final response dated 11 May 2023, Admiral acknowledged the delays in making the 
settlement and said it was sending Mrs L £200.00 to cover the time, trouble and upset 
caused in having to chase this over a period of months. Admiral also said it was sending her 
a further £50.00 due to the delay in providing the final response.
By a letter dated mid-May 2023, Admiral said that it was also sending about £20.00 in added 
8% simple interest on the two payments of £1,176.33.
Mrs L brought her complaint to us in late May 2023.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He thought that 
the redress of £200.00 for the time, trouble and upset caused was fair. However, he thought 
that Admiral shouldve cleared the finance by 9 March 2023. 
The investigator recommended that Admiral should:
1. make a refund of the interest accrued after 9 March 2023 (subject to Mrs L providing 
the necessary evidence to include a copy of the agreement showing the interest rate 
and the statements from 9 March 2023 to closing to show the interest charged), and
2. make a loss of use payment from 9 March 2023 to the date the finance agreement 
was closed at the rate of £10.00 per day.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mrs L  
and to Admiral on 4 December 2023. I summarise my findings:
Admiral tried to put things right for Mrs L with a payment of £200.00 compensation for 
distress and inconvenience (in addition to the reimbursement of the instalments). I 
was satisfied that this was fair and reasonable in line with our guidelines.
Subject to any further information either from Mrs L or from Admiral, my provisional decision 
was that I didnt intend to direct Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Ltd to do any more in response 
to this complaint.
Neither Mrs L nor Admiral has responded to the provisional decision. So I see no reason to 
change my view. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Like many motor policies, Admirals policy only provided a courtesy car while the insured 
vehicle was being repaired  and not if it was stolen and not recovered (or otherwise a total 
loss).
Mrs L had reported a high-value theft. I accept that Admiral needed to investigate the 
circumstances.Mrs L chose to instruct solicitors. However, I dont consider that Admiral had done anything 
wrong at that time. In any event, I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to 
reimburse Mrs L for legal fees.
I dont hold Admiral responsible for any unreasonable delay before about 4 February 2023, 
when it received the CCTV images.
From its file, Ive seen that Admiral tried to pay the finance company, but payment was 
rejected for some reason. Nevertheless, I wouldve expected Admiral to pay the balance due 
to the finance company and the balance to Mrs L by about 9 March 2023.
Im satisfied that Admiral made an interim payment to Mrs L before that date. However, 
Admiral didnt pay the finance company until late April or early May 2023.
In the meantime, this delay meant that Mrs L continued to pay instalments and she still had a 
liability of over £60,000.00 to the finance company. So I accept that the delay is likely to 
have caused her to defer any acquisition of a replacement vehicle.
However, Mrs L hasnt provided enough detail or evidence of what needs, and what 
resources, she had for transport in March and April 2023.
In any event, Admiral reimbursed Mrs L for two monthly instalments under the finance 
agreement. They are likely to have been partly payment of interest but mostly payment of 
capital or depreciation. Admiral also paid the balance due for early settlement of the finance 
agreement. 
So I dont consider that Mrs L has suffered any financial loss that it would be fair for Admiral 
to reimburse.
Indeed, I find it likely that, by reimbursing the two instalments of £1,176.33, Admiral has put 
Mrs L in a much better financial position than if it had merely reimbursed the additional 
interest it had caused plus £10.00 per day for loss of use for about two months.
So  unlike our investigator  I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to pay Mrs L 
(in addition to those reimbursed instalments) compensation for loss of use of a replacement 
vehicle that she might otherwise have acquired.
The theft and the need to make a claim were bound to cause Mrs L some distress and 
inconvenience. Ive thought about the extra and unnecessary distress and inconvenience 
Admirals delay caused Mrs L. That included having to contact Admiral and the finance 
company on more occasions than wouldve been necessary if Admiral had paid sooner.
Nevertheless, Admiral tried to put things right for Mrs L with a payment of £200.00 
compensation for distress and inconvenience (in addition to the reimbursement of the 
instalments). Im satisfied that this was fair and reasonable in line with our guidelines.
In conclusion, it wouldnt be fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to pay any more than it has 
already paid to Mrs L.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont direct Admiral Insurance 
(Gibraltar) Ltd to do any more in response to this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 January 2024.
