The complaint
Miss S complains about a buyer dispute claim with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, 
that it was unfair for it to decline the buyer dispute in the circumstances of this complaint. 
And in this situation, I dont think thats the case. Ill explain why. 
Miss S signed up to PayPals User Agreement when she opened her account.
Within the User Agreement, it states 
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
It goes on to say.
Step 4: Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery.
I appreciate Miss S made a purchase from an international seller and this has meant 
the return shipping costs are high. Miss S wouldve been aware of the possibility that 
she would need to pay any additional shipping costs to return the item but choose to 
go ahead with the purchase. 
PayPal emailed Miss S on 15 September 2022 asking her to return the item for a 
refund. When no tracking information was sent to PayPal, the dispute was closed.  
Having considered all of the information both parties have supplied in the 
circumstances of this complaint, as Miss S hasnt been able to provide proof of a 
return delivery, Im satisfied PayPal havent treated Miss S unfairly or against terms 
of the User Agreement when it has declined and closed her claim.
Miss S is able to go direct to the seller and ask that postage is paid to return her item. 
This is not something I have investigated as part of this complaint, as Ive only 
looked at the protection offered under PayPals policy and not the sellers.
In summary, although I understand Miss Ss frustration if she was sent the wrong 
item, Ive not found PayPal need to reimburse the cost to return the item as part of 
the protection it offers in these circumstances. So, I dont uphold this complaint.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
