K820x#14complaint
Mrs S is unhappy with the compensation paid by Aviva Insurance  Limited  (Aviva)  to settle 
her complaint about mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) taken  out with a catalogue 
account.
background
Mrs S opened a catalogue  account in April 1994 and at the same time took out a PPI policy. 
The policy was cancelled in November  2009.  
When the policy was first taken out Aviva was responsible for it but their responsibility was 
transferred to Shop Direct Finance  Company Ltd (Shop Direct)  in May 2004, although there 
was no break in the policy. Shop  Direct is authorised by Aviva  to deal with complaints  about 
the mis-sale of PPI on its behalf.  
When Mrs S complained the policy had been  mis-sold, Shop  Direct took responsibility  for the 
complaint from the start of the policy in 1994  until it ended in 2009. It wrote to Mrs S in 
May 2018 agreeing to uphold the complaint and offering her compensation. 
Mrs S was unhappy with the compensation she received so she brought her complaint to 
this service.
Our adjudicator said what Mrs S has been  offered and paid is fair to put her in the position 
as if she had never bought the PPI.
Mrs S didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to look at her complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Shop Direct agreed to uphold  Mrs S complaint that the PPI was mis-sold,  so Im not in this 
decision looking at how the policy came to be sold to Mrs S. Im only considering if the 
compensation offered and paid to Mrs S is fair.
Because the policy was the responsibility of two businesses whilst it was running on the 
account, some of the information about the calculation has been split into the amounts that 
each business  was responsible for. However Shop Direct is overall dealing with the 
complaint and paying the compensation to Mrs S.
The statements  for the account have  been provided and I can see what  Mrs S paid for the 
PPI. I think  the £1,299.38  worked out as the total premiums for the PPI for the whole  period  
it was on the account  is correct. Shop  Direct has also refunded  £111.02 of additional 
charges that it says the PPI caused  and added some simple interest to compensate  for any 
periods Mrs S was out of pocket. Overall I think this calculation of the compensation is fair.
Aviva was responsible  for the policy  from its start in 1998 to 2004. During this time the costs  
paid for the PPI and the simple interest came  to £797.90. So this is the share of the 
compensation that Aviva is responsible for.
Ref: DRN12344702From 2004  the PPI was the responsibility  of Shop Direct. In 2009  Mrs S had got into 
difficulties making her payments to the account  and it was suspended and the PPI cancelled. 
In 2012 the debt owing on the account  was sold by Shop Direct to a third party.
The PPI costs and any simple interest  worked  out as due to Mrs S from 2004 to 2009, came  
to £1,111.32. This being the amount  Shop Direct was responsible to pay. But the debt that 
had been sold in 2012 was bought  back, this debt being for £529.27. So part of the 
compensation of £1,111.32 was then used to pay that debt and it left £582.05 to be paid to 
Mrs S by Shop Direct. 
In summary  the total compensation due to Mrs S for the whole period the PPI was active on 
the account comes  to £1,909.22 (after  tax). But after the debt amount of £529.27 was paid it 
left £1,379.95 due to Mrs S. 
The offer letter sent to Mrs S by Shop direct explained this £1,379.95  as being paid by two 
amounts. It says We will issue you a cheque for  £582.05 owed to you in relation to 
your SDFC  [Shop Direct  Financial Company] policy .. A cheque  amount for the value of 
£797.90 will be issued to you in relation  to your Aviva Policy .
From the records provided  by Shop Direct  I can see a cheque  payment for £1,379.95 was 
made to Mrs S on 18 May 2018  and this cleared on 30 May 2018. Mrs S has said in her 
correspondence she had received a cheque for £1,379.95 which  was cashed. 
However Mrs S feels she is still owed a further  cheque for £797.90. This may be because 
the offer letter sent to her showed in the calculation that the total compensation was 
£1,909.22 and she didnt get back this full amount. Bu this amount did not take into account 
the debt Mrs S still owed  on her account.  Once this debt of £529.27 is taken  off the total 
compensation of £1,909.22 it leaves £1,379.95, which is what Mrs S has been paid.
Although the offer letter  makes reference to two cheques, one from Shop Direct  and one 
from Aviva, this perhaps should have been  expressed as two amounts. But the total due, 
after deduction of the debt, was £1,379.95  and that is what was paid and received by Mrs S. 
So I dont  think the business owes her any more  or has done  anything wrong.
I know Mrs S feels she received poor service from Shop Direct on behalf of Aviva when 
dealing with her complaint.  But I dont think what it did caused her any loss or additional 
inconvenience than anyone who brings a complaint.  So I dont think  it would be fair to direct  
Aviva to pay anything further.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I think what Aviva  Insurance  Limited has paid to Mrs S 
as compensation  for the mis-sold PPI on her account is fair and Im not telling it to do 
anything further.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
