The complaint
Miss G complains that her National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) debit card kept 
getting stopped as it had been reported as lost or stolen. She says this happened seven 
times and she doesnt know who reported this. Miss G was abroad at the time and was 
unable to access any funds for over a month as she had no other cards. She says that when 
she tried to open a new account it was closed by NatWest and her only option was to take all 
of her money out. Miss G is unhappy that NatWest has breached the data protection rules by 
passing on her details to someone else and wants a record of the details NatWest has 
passed on. 
What happened
Miss G says that she was on a trip abroad and tried to use her debit card (6028) but it didnt 
work. She contacted NatWest on 9 July 2019 and was advised that the card had been 
stopped as it had been reported lost or stolen by someone on 3 July 2019. Miss G told 
NatWest that this was not her and she was not aware of this. NatWest was unable to explain 
why the card had been stopped but a new debit card (3567) was ordered and NatWest 
apologised and credited Miss Gs account with £140 in compensation  this was for calls 
made (£70), charges incurred in transferring money to her friend to withdraw (£20) and 
inconvenience (£70). 
Before Miss G had received the new 3567 debit card, this was also stopped as stolen on 28 
July 2019 and Miss G contacted NatWest on 29 July 2019. NatWest was again unable to 
explain why this had happened and ordered Miss G a new debit card (4092). It apologised 
and credited Miss Gs account with a further £100 for the cost of postage of Miss Gs card 
abroad (£40), further calls made and the inconvenience caused (£60).
The 4092 debit card was received by Miss G but had also been stopped as lost on 31 July 
2019. When she spoke with NatWest on 21 August 2019 in relation to this, Miss G confirmed 
that another new debit card (9234) had been received at her UK address on that date and 
that this would be posted overseas to her by her mother.  NatWest apologised for the further 
inconvenience caused and credited Miss Gs account with £90 for the cost of postage (£40) 
and further inconvenience caused (£50). It was again unable to explain why the debit cards 
were stopped as lost or stolen.
NatWests notes indicate that the 9234 card was also cancelled due to being reported lost or 
stolen on 25 August 2019 and she was sent a new card (6775) on 3 September 2019. This 
was also stopped on 23 September 2019 for the same reason. Miss G says that this 
happened on seven occasions. 
During this period Miss Gs mobile banking app was also blocked so she was unable to use 
this to transfer funds to a friend in order to buy her ticket home. When she returned to the 
UK, Miss G opened a new account in September 2019. However, this was only open for one 
day and was then closed. NatWest says that this appears to have been a commercial 
decision following further checks.
NatWest says that it is unable to provide any further information as to who tried to access 
Miss Gs account as it cannot locate call recordings if it doesnt know the number which was 
used to report the cards lost or stolen. It says that is unable to stop someone from 
impersonating Miss G and says that it would advise opening another account and closing the 
problematic account in these circumstances. 
Our investigator found that there appeared to be a system error which was categorising the 
cards as lost or stolen and stopping them, to which NatWest was unable to find a solution. 
This led to Miss G not being able to access her banking services such as her debit card and 
online banking. He found that NatWest was entitled to decline Miss Gs application for a new 
account and this meant Miss Gs only option was to move her banking services elsewhere. 
Given that the investigator didnt think that there was a third party involved, he didnt find that 
NatWest had breached any data protection rules. The investigator concluded that NatWest 
should provide a further £250 to Miss G for distress and inconvenience (on top of the £180 
which had already been paid). 
NatWest has disagreed with this so the case has come to me to make a decision. It says 
that it has made a total redress award of £330 in this case and doesnt agree that it needs to 
do anything further to address Miss Gs complaint. NatWest says that it appreciates that the 
impact on Miss G was significant as she was abroad at the time. However, it says that there 
isnt anything it could have done to stop someone else trying to access Miss Gs account 
beyond advising that the account be closed and a replacement account opened. It says that 
it had no option but to cancel the cards. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having looked at the evidence I agree with the investigators view for broadly the same 
reasons and I've explained my reasons further below.
It is clear from the evidence I have seen that Miss G contacted NatWest on a number of 
occasions and advised it that it wasnt her who was reporting the cards as lost or stolen. 
Despite her asking for details of who had reported this, NatWest was unable to give her any 
information as to why the cards were stopped. 
NatWest has said that is unable to stop someone from impersonating Miss G and that it had 
no option but to cancel her cards as there were concerns that someone else was trying to 
access her account. I accept that  had a third party been contacting NatWest pretending to 
be Miss G  NatWest would have been unable to prevent this from happening. Likewise, had 
there been concerns that another party had access to Miss Gs account, it would have been 
prudent for NatWest to ensure that only Miss G was able to access the account (but not to 
prevent Miss G herself from accessing her own account). 
However, NatWest has been unable to provide any evidence to show that it was a third party 
calling which led to the cancellation of the cards. There are no call records or file notes to 
say someone called to cancel the card, which might be expected  particularly by the time 
that this had been flagged as an ongoing issue on the account. It is also clear from the 
investigation file that there appeared to be something on NatWests internal systems for the 
account which meant that the card was stopped automatically. One of NatWests staff noted 
that the system allowed her to order a card but then stopped it days later. It is clear from the 
investigation notes that the staff member tried to resolve this via a number of avenues but 
appeared to be unsuccessful.
In response to the view, NatWest says that there was a credit marker which should not have any bearing on debit card orders. It says that it believes that someone was attempting to 
impersonate Miss G as she said she didnt make the calls. It also says that Miss G contacted 
the police about the matter and she wouldnt have done this if she wasnt concerned about 
someone trying to access her accounts. 
Im not persuaded that this indicates there was a third party involved. Clearly Miss G was 
concerned about someone being able to access her accounts and cancel her cards without 
her knowledge. But Miss G was never informed by NatWest that the repeated cancellation of 
her cards may have been due to a system error. When she questioned why her cards had 
been cancelled and requested details of the calls made to cancel them, NatWest was unable 
to give her any information and didnt advise Miss G that there may not in fact have been 
calls by a third party. So, in the absence of being provided with any other explanation by 
NatWest despite repeated requests, I dont think it was unreasonable for Miss G to have 
made an assumption that someone else must have cancelled her cards and contacted the 
police accordingly. Miss G says that it was in fact NatWest who advised her to contact the 
police.
For these reasons, I think it is most likely that the cancelling of Miss Gs cards was due to a 
NatWest system error.  
This error persisted for some time and happened repeatedly despite NatWest being aware 
that there was a problem with cards being cancelled without Miss Gs knowledge. This 
resulted in Miss G being unable to use her debit card to access funds over a significant 
period of time while she was out of the country. When the cards were cancelled, she was 
also blocked from using her online app to transfer funds to a third party so she could access 
cash while she was abroad. 
NatWest has said that in these circumstances it would advise Miss G to open another 
account and close the problematic account. However, when she tried to do so NatWest 
closed the new account shortly after it had been opened. Whilst it is entitled to decide who it 
provides banking services to, I can see that this would have compounded Miss Gs 
frustration having simply followed the advice she was given to try and solve the problem. 
Miss G has since had to move her accounts to a different banking provider.
Putting things right
In light of the above I, like our investigator, think it would be appropriate for NatWest to pay 
Miss G a further £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience suffered as a result 
of this matter as it is my view that the compensation already paid is insufficient in the 
circumstances of this case.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Miss G 
£250 for distress and inconvenience to resolve this complaint. For the avoidance of any 
doubt, this is in addition to the sums the bank has already paid Miss G.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 January 2021.
