The complaint
Mrs B says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to 
her.                           
Background
This complaint is about 12 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mrs B between April 2016 
and November 2017. Mrs Bs borrowing history is summarised below:

1 21/04/2016 30/09/2016 6 £600.00
2 19/05/2016 31/10/2016 6 £200.00
3 24/08/2016 02/11/2016 6 £550.00

12 17/11/2017 28/06/2019 7 £1,000.00
 
In its final response letter, Sunny offered to uphold loans 11 and 12. Mrs B didnt accept this 
offer and brought her complaint to this service. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 3 
onwards shouldnt have been given as Mrs B had loans from other short-term lenders as 
well as Sunny. They also thought the pattern of borrowing indicated Mrs B was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but repeated its offer of upholding loans 11 and 12. Mrs B 
declined Sunnys offer again so, the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mrs Bs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to more when it approved loans 1 and 2. Mrs B 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about these 
loans, I won be making further findings on them.Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 3 to Mrs B and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mrs Bs third loan in four months, I think 
Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mrs Bs finances before 
lending her this loan. 
Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 3, its likely to have found 
that Mrs B was borrowing from other short-term lenders as well as having out-standing loans 
with Sunny itself. Although I acknowledge that Sunnys business model was to allow 
consumers to have a set number of loans running concurrently, the repayments for all these 
loans would have been increasing Mrs Bs monthly outgoing. This in turn would have 
increased the likelihood of her having to borrow again to manage her repayments 
sustainably. I think this was shown when she took her fourth loans two months later.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mrs Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs B had taken out seven loans within nine months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs B was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Mrs 
Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From loan 7 onwards Mrs B was provided with a new loan within weeks of taking out 
the previous one. 
Mrs B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out 19 months after Mrs Bs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mrs B had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mrs B lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
 
 
 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mrs B paid on loan 3 to 12;pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 3 to 6 from Mrs Bs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 12 should be removed from 
Mrs Bs credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Bs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2020.
