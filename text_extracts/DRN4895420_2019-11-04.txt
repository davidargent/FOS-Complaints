Our adjudicator recommended  Mr Ss complaint  be partially upheld. He felt that Uncle Buck  
ought to have realised it was unlikely Mr S wouldve been able to sustainably repay the loans 
from loan 5 onwards.
Uncle Buck  didnt agree with the adjudicators  conclusions, so the case had been passed to 
me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the adjudicator for the same reasons.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Uncle Buck lent to Mr S. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Uncle Buck.
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words the assessment  needs  to be consumer-focussed.  It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
Ref: DRN48954202As set out in the guidance, the risk to the consumer  directly relates to the particulars of the 
lending and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way.
Certain factors might point to the fact that Uncle Buck should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Uncle Buck was required to establish  whether  Mr S could  sustainably  repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. 
It follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Uncle Buck  had done  anything wrong when  it lent loans 1  4 
and neither party disputed those findings  As  there  isnt a dispute about these loans, I have 
focused my decision on loans 5  7; the loans still in dispute by Uncle Buck.
Ref: DRN48954203Looking at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending history with Mr S, I think there was a 
point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen  that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle Buck should  have  realised at this point 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans to Mr S. I think  that this point was reached  
by loan 5. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 and 4 of Mr S taking  new loans 
shortly after repaying  previous ones. I think that by loan 5, Uncle  Buck ought fairly 
and reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established.
So Uncle  Buck  ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were  leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Uncle  Buck. 
Loan 5 was taken out 12 months after loan 1 and it was for the same amount.
In the 12 month period between loan 1 and loan 5, Mr S had been indebted to Uncle 
Buck for all but 50 days.
Mr S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Uncle  Buck 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards. These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of time. 
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ss ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-7 and Uncle Buck should put things  right as 
set out below.
Ref: DRN48954204Putting things  right
Uncle Buck  shouldnt have given Mr S loans 5-7. In order to put things  right for Mr S, Uncle  
Buck should
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr S towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  Uncle Buck has already refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr S which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) pay Mr S the total of A plus B.
D) the overall pattern of Mr Ss borrowing for loans 5-7 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Uncle Buck should remove these loans entirely 
from Mr Ss credit  file. 
 *HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to deduct tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
should give Mr S a certificate  showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mr Ss complaint as Ive explained above. I require 
Uncle Buck  Finance LLP trading as Uncle Buck to put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 December 2019.
