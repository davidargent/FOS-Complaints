The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Sie SCA wont refund him the cost of an item 
he ordered but never received. 
What happened
Mr B ordered an item through a games website. The item cost £449. When the item didnt 
arrive, Mr B raised a non-receipt claim with PayPal. 
PayPal declined Mr Bs claim, saying the transaction was made as a donation, not as a 
payment for goods or services. It explained that donations werent covered under its buyer 
protection policy.
Mr B complained, but PayPal maintained its position, so he brought his complaint to the 
financial ombudsman. Mr B said hed been the victim of a scam and had not authorised his 
payment as a donation. He provided evidence indicating the seller had cloned a legitimate 
website.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint. She didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly 
and said Mr B wouldve seen the payment was to be processed as a donation before 
committing to sending the money. 
Mr B disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding Mr Bs complaint. I know this will be unwelcome news for 
Mr B. Ill explain my decision.
PayPal has provided evidence to show that Mr Bs payment was processed as a donation. 
And its said a seller is not able to change PayPals website or any of the wording. Its 
provided screenshots to show what Mr B wouldve seen prior to making the transaction. The 
screenshot is clearly marked as a donation and before confirming the transaction via the 
donate now button, the customer has the opportunity to review PayPals policies and 
payment method rights. 
Mr B doesnt accept this. He says the screenshot PayPals provided isnt his transaction  
indeed it isnt, its an example - and in any event, it wasnt the screen he saw. 
PayPal said its not able to provide a screenshot of Mr Bs actual transaction, due to the 
passage of time. And equally, Mr B doesnt have a screenshot showing what he actually 
agreed to. I think both these positions are understandable and reasonable. I wouldnt expect 
PayPal to retain such evidence of every transaction made through its platform. And neither 
would I expect a customer to screenshot a record of the stages of every transaction they 
made.  
PayPal also provided evidence of the actual confirmation email sent to Mr B after the 
transaction was processed. Again, this clearly states, youve donated £449.00 GBP to 
[name@domainname]. The email address is a personal one, and doesnt appear to bear 
any relationship to the website Mr B thought he was buying from. Its arguable that if Mr B 
didnt think or realise hed made a donation, this email ought to have alerted him to a 
potential problem. 
I have to make a decision based on the evidence Ive seen. On balance of probabilities, Im 
persuaded the transaction was made as a donation. And having reviewed PayPals policies, 
Im satisfied Mr Bs transaction isnt covered by buyer protection. 
I know Mr Bs unhappy with how PayPal responded to his situation and doesnt think its 
done enough to help him. Ive thought about whether PayPal shouldve done anything more, 
particularly when Mr B raised the possibility of fraud. But even if PayPal had reconsidered Mr 
Bs dispute in this light, on balance I dont think it wouldve made a difference. Mr B raised 
his dispute six days after the payment was made, initially as an item not received dispute. 
In our experience of complaints involving scammed payments, the scammer usually 
removes the funds from the recipient account very quickly. So in all likelihood, by the time Mr 
B raised his dispute, the funds would no longer have been in the recipient account.
I can see why Mr B is frustrated and upset about what happened, and I appreciate hes lost 
out here. But that doesnt mean PayPal should reimburse his losses. For the reasons Ive 
given, I dont think PayPal treated Mr B unfairly by declining buyer protection. And on 
balance, I dont think it couldve done anything more to prevent his loss.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2023.
