The complaint
Mrs M  and Mr M complain that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked and closed 
their accounts. They say this caused them a lot of problems and upset and they want 
NatWest to pay them compensation.
What happened
The detailed background of this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here.
Mrs M and her husband Mr M were long standing customers of NatWest. Mrs M had a 
current account along with joint savings accounts with her husband and an ISA account. 
Mrs M has explained that the NatWest accounts were her main accounts. She has said that 
she used the accounts to receive wages and pay bills via direct debits, everyday living costs 
and to pay for important things such as her childrens tutoring lessons, university fees and 
driving lessons.  
In November 2022, NatWest blocked and reviewed Mrs M and Mr Ms accounts. This meant 
they werent able to access the funds in the accounts. The accounts were blocked between 
11 and 21 November 2022. Following this, in February 2023, NatWest decided to close 
Mrs M and Mr Ms accounts. NatWest wrote to them to let them know they had 60 days to 
make alternative banking arrangements. Mrs M and Mr M set up new accounts with different 
banks, rearranged their direct debits and moved their funds across to their new accounts. 
However, NatWest didnt close their accounts and sent them another letter in April 2023 
giving them 60 days notice that their accounts would be closed in June 2023.  
Mrs M has said that due to the block on her accounts she had to borrow money to pay for 
food and fuel which was embarrassing and upsetting. Shes also said that she suffers from 
anxiety and the actions of NatWest made her condition much worse and led to sleepless 
nights. Mrs M says NatWest should have warned her and Mr M that their accounts were 
going to be blocked which would have meant they could have made some alternative 
arrangements. And that receiving another set of closure letters in April 2023 was confusing. 
Mrs M complained to NatWest. In response NatWest said it was complying with its legal and 
regulatory obligations when it had blocked Mrs Ms and Mr Ms accounts. It acknowledged 
that at times it didnt provide the best service in response to Mrs Ms calls and apologised. It 
also said that there were delays in closing the accounts and offered them £200 
compensation for any trouble and upset this had caused them.
Unhappy with this response, Mrs M and Mr M brought their complaint to our service where 
an investigator considered it. The investigator said that NatWest were entitled to block and 
close accounts. She also thought that the £200 offered by NatWest for the delays closing the 
accounts was fair. Mrs M disagreed and said that the amount of compensation offered isnt 
enough because she and her husband had several accounts. And had to pay extra costs to 
get through the difficult time the accounts were blocked 
In response to the investigators view NatWest provided more information about the reasons 
it blocked and closed Mrs Ms and Mr Ms accounts. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mrs M and Mr M, but Id like to reassure them 
that I have considered everything.
Account block and closure 
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect 
persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Theyre also required 
to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means 
they need to restrict customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out their 
review. The terms of the account also permit NatWest to block an account. This means 
NatWest is entitled to block and review an account at any time.
Having looked at all the evidence, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances 
for NatWest to block Mrs M and Mr Ms accounts. NatWest has explained that this was its 
standard procedure, and I accept that it was. Im satisfied that in doing so NatWest were 
complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. So, whilst I accept, the banks actions 
caused Mrs M and Mr M inconvenience and upset when it blocked their accounts, I cant say 
the bank did anything wrong and treated them unfairly in doing so. 
I understand that Mrs M and Mr M would have liked to have known about the block before it 
happened. I appreciate that if they had been told they would have been able to get their 
finances reorganised. But NatWest dont have to warn its customers that it intends to restrict 
their accounts before placing a block on them. However, I can see that NatWest wrote to 
Mrs M on 15 November 2022 letting her know that it had blocked her accounts  albeit this 
was after the block was in place. The letter also set out the relevant terms in the account 
conditions which permit them to block an account. And how it would impact payments into 
and out of her accounts. So, Im satisfied NatWest did let Mrs M know what it was doing with 
her accounts and reasonably quickly.
Banks are also entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as this is 
done fairly, doesnt breach law or regulations and is in keeping with the terms and 
conditions. And unless theres a good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a 
bank must keep a customer. But they shouldnt decline to open an account without proper 
reason, for instance of unfair bias or unlawful discrimination. And they must treat new and 
existing customers fairly. In this instance the terms of Mrs Ms and Mr Ms accounts say that 
in certain instances NatWest can close the accounts with immediate notice and by providing 
60 days notice. NatWest wrote to Mrs M and Mr M in February 2023, giving them 60 days  
notice that it was closing their accounts and that theyd need to make alternative banking 
arrangements. This can be due to a number of reasons and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the 
customer. Just the same as if Mrs M and Mr M decided to stop banking with NatWest, they 
wouldnt have to explain why. Based on what NatWest has shared with this service, Im 
satisfied their actions were reasonable in the circumstances. And the banks decision to stop 
providing Mrs M and Mr M with banking facilities was reached legitimately and fairly. 
I can see that Mrs M and Mr M responded to the notice to closure letters that they received 
by opening new accounts with a different bank and moving their funds out of their NatWest 
accounts. However, NatWest didnt close the accounts and sent Mrs M and Mr M more 
notice close letters in April 2023. Mrs M has said she didnt realise that the accounts hadnt 
been closed and was quite confused by receiving more letters addressed to her and her 
family. 
NatWest has apologised for the delay in closing the accounts and offered Mrs M and Mr M 
£200 compensation for any trouble and upset this caused them. Ive considered what Mrs M 
has told us about how NatWests actions impacted her and her husband. I cant see that 
NatWests delays in closing the accounts had much of an impact on them. The accounts 
were always going to be closed. However, I can appreciate that receiving the letters would 
have caused Mrs M some worry and confusion. So, I agree that Mrs M and Mr M should 
receive some compensation. But Ive also kept in mind that theyd already moved their 
banking elsewhere by the time the letters arrived. And Mrs M doesnt seem to have been 
aware that the accounts with NatWest hadnt been closed until she received the letters in 
April 2023. With all this in mind, Im satisfied that the £200 compensation already offered 
fairly recognises the impact NatWests delay in closing the accounts had in the overall 
circumstances of this complaint. So, I wont be directing NatWest to pay any more.    
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained my final decision is that I partly uphold this complaint. To put 
things right National Westminster Bank Plc should:
Pay Mrs M and Mr M £200 compensation for trouble and upset caused by the delay 
in closing their accounts
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
