The complaint
Mr H complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) having agreed he could make an overpayment to his 
credit card account for a car purchase, then refused the transaction and took over a month 
to return the funds to his bank account. 
What happened
Mr H says he telephoned NewDay in early July 2021 and informed them he was looking to 
make a large payment into his credit card account, to enable the purchase of a car from a 
car dealership. Mr H says NewDay agreed he could make an overpayment to his credit card 
account, but on the day of the purchase, NewDay blocked the transaction for security 
reasons causing him great embarrassment. Mr H says he then instructed NewDay to return 
the credit balance of his credit card account to his bank account and was told it would take 
10 days, but it took NewDay over a month to make the payment. 
Mr H feels NewDay misinformed him about the transaction and took far too long to refund 
the balance back to his bank account. Mr H wants NewDay to pay him compensation for the 
stress he has gone through and for the loss of interest during this time. Mr H believes 
NewDays customers refund policy should be improved.  
NewDay says he failed the security questions at the time of the transaction, and this is in 
place for the customers benefit and had done nothing wrong here. As far as the refund of the 
credit balance remaining on Mr Hs credit card account, initially NewDay felt it had been 
actioned within its refund timescale of 28 days. Subsequently, NewDay have accepted it had 
incorrectly told Mr H in its final response letter, that it would take 28 days to make the credit 
balance refund, when in fact it should have made the refund in 10 working days, but failed to 
do so because of an internal system error. As a result, NewDay agreed to pay Mr H £50 by 
way of compensation and a further £150 to represent 8% simple interest on the sum 
involved over this period of time. 
Mr H wasnt happy with NewDays response or its subsequent revised offer of compensation 
and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mr Hs complaint. The 
investigator felt NewDay had told Mr H he could make the initial transaction and the security 
questions it raised, wouldnt have occurred if Mr Hs credit card account hadnt been in 
credit. The investigator also felt NewDays offer of compensation of £50 for the 
misinformation concerning the refund and how long it took, didnt go far enough. The 
investigator felt to put matters right NewDay should pay a total compensation payment of 
£300 alongside the £150 NewDay had agreed to pay, representing 8% simple interest while 
Mr Hs funds were unavailable to him. 
NewDay didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said :
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to that of the investigator and I will 
explain how I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating and upsetting for Mr H having thought he 
had put in place an arrangement to make a sizeable purchase on his credit card account, 
only to see the transaction declined by NewDay and then for it to take several weeks to 
refund the monies to him. 
Mr Hs complaint centres around two issues, firstly NewDay had confirmed to him over the 
telephone it was ok to transfer a large sum to his credit card account to purchase a car, and 
then declined the transaction for security reasons. Secondly, having made this mistake 
NewDay took several weeks to refund the credit balance on his credit card to his bank 
account, having told him it would take 10 days. 
As far as the first part of Mr Hs complaint is concerned, I have listened to the telephone call 
Mr H made in early July 2021 to NewDay, to discuss the potential car purchase and the 
transaction he wanted to make. In that call on more than one occasion NewDays advisor did 
tell Mr H it couldnt recommend he transferred such a large sum to his credit card account 
and a bank transfer would be a preferable method, albeit such a transaction was available to 
him. While perhaps NewDays agent could have elaborated here as to why she couldnt 
recommend this type of transaction, its fair to say from listening to that call, Mr H was intent 
on making the payment using his credit card account. So that was a decision he chose to 
make here. 
Additionally, when the transaction was attempted it was for a sum considerably less than the 
amount Mr H had discussed over the telephone with NewDay and given he wasnt able to 
answer the security questions when asked, I cant say NewDay were at fault when it 
declined the transaction. Its worth saying these type of security measures are also in place 
to protect consumers against potential fraud. So overall on this part of Mr Hs complaint, I am 
satisfied NewDay have acted reasonably here. 
Where I do support Mr Hs complaint, is over the time it took NewDay to return the credit 
balance of the credit card account to his bank account once he had requested it. NewDay 
initially informed Mr H in its final response letter, that it had acted fairly taking 28 days to 
return the payment. Subsequently however, NewDay have accepted its response was 
incorrect and it should have been actioned in 10 working days, as it had originally advised 
Mr H. 
So, while NewDay have agreed to pay 8% simple interest on the balance of the credit card 
account for the delayed period in question, rounded up to a sum of £150, Im not persuaded 
that its offer of compensation of £50 goes far enough here. Given the worry and stress Mr H 
went through over this matter and the misinformation NewDay gave, I am of the view a more 
realistic sum of redress here should be £150. 
While neither party may be happy with my provisional decision, I am satisfied this is a fair 
outcome here. 
I propose NewDay pay Mr H £150 for the trouble and upset caused over the misinformation 
and for the delay in refunding the balance of his credit card account, along with the £150 it 
has already agreed to pay for the loss of availability of those funds for the period in question. A total of £300.
I gave both Mr H and NewDay until 28 September 2022 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. While Mr H responded to my provisional decision, I have heard nothing further from 
NewDay, so the case has been passed back to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H was disappointed with my reasoning regarding the blocking of his payment on his 
account, but he was happy to accept the overall decision. Despite reminding NewDay of the 
deadline to respond to my provisional decision, I have heard nothing further from them and 
with that in mind I see no reason to change or alter my provisional decision, so my final 
decision remains the same. 
Putting things right
I instruct NewDay Ltd to pay Mr H £150 for the trouble and upset caused over the 
misinformation and delay in refunding the balance of his credit card account, along with the 
£150 it already agreed to pay for the loss of availability of those funds, for the period in 
question. Therefore, a total of £300.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct NewDay Ltd to pay Mr H £150 for the trouble and upset caused over the 
misinformation and delay in refunding the balance of his credit card account, along with the 
£150 it already agreed to pay for the loss of availability of those funds, for the period in 
question. Therefore, a total of £300.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2022.
