Ms M said that she had several payday loans at the same time which would have been 
shown on her credit file. She had to keep taking out more and more loans to cover her other 
loans.
our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended that Ms Ms complaint about Loans 4 to 30 should be upheld. 
He said that by Loan 4, proportionate checks would most likely have shown Ms M
was having problems managing her money. He thought in the month before she took 
Loan 4, LS would have become aware Ms M was paying over £2,200 to online gambling
sites. She was also using eight other short-term loan providers and a pawn-broker. Within
less than a week of receiving her salary she was almost overdrawn. In these
circumstances, he thought LS ought to have realised it was unlikely Ms M wouldve been 
able to sustainably repay this loan  and any subsequent loans.
LS responded to say that considering the points that had been raised in the adjudicators 
assessment, it agreed to refund the interest and charges paid towards Loans 4 to 30 
amounting to £1098.96 (£984.09 for Interest paid, £0.00 for Fees paid, £143.59 for 8% 
annual interest, minus £28.72 for 20% mandatory tax withholding in line with HMRC 
regulations). Furthermore, it would remove all the entries for the loans from
Ms Ms credit file. LS also said that there was an outstanding balance due from Ms M of 
£779.34. When it subtracted this from the amount it was offering to pay, this resulted in a 
final refund of £319.62 due to Ms M.
The adjudicator told Ms M about LSs offer. Ms M said that LSs calculations were incorrect. 
So, the adjudicator contacted LS and referred it to the amounts due from Ms M set out in 
LSs account statements dated 15 June 2020. The adjudicator said that the outstanding 
balance due from Ms M was no more than £563.46 and asked LS for its comments on this. 
But this service hasnt received a response from LS to the adjudicators query.
Ms M has also queried whether she had more than 30 loans provided by LS. She had sent 
this service her account statements for this to be checked.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms M 
and to LS on 28 August 2020.  I summarise my findings:
As LS had offered to settle Loans 4 to 30, I hadnt investigated these loans. But I said I 
would include the redress for these loans in my proposed compensation award.
I noted that when LS had lent to Ms M the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority and 
relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The 
CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
I said that LS needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that LS should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors included:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There might even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought that it was important for me to start by saying that LS was required to establish 
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow this 
was the case. This was because the CONC defined sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the consumer should be able to make repayments, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it followed that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wouldnt be able to make their repayments sustainably if they were unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Ms Ms complaint.
LS had made a number of checks before it lent Loans 1 to 3 to Ms M. It had asked her for 
details of her monthly income and expenditure. Ms Ms declared income was between 
£1,500 and £1,900 for all the loans. Ms Ms declared expenditure as adjusted by LS was 
between £550 and £632. 
LS said that it had also checked Ms Ms credit file before agreeing to the loans. Id seen brief 
results from LSs credit checks.
It didnt appear that wed received Ms Ms credit report.
Ms Ms first three loans were repayable by six monthly instalments. So, the amounts that 
Ms M needed to repay each time were smaller than if shed taken a normal payday loan. But 
she was also committing to making those repayments over a far longer period. In addition, 
Ms M sometimes had a number of loans outstanding at the same time. So, Id considered 
the total amount that Ms M needed to repay to LS each month. 
Loan 1 was for £100. I could see that LSs credit checks for Ms Ms first three loans showed 
that she had four active accounts. She also had two defaulted accounts from more than five 
years prior to Loan 1. Given the length of time since the accounts had defaulted, I thought 
that LS might have reasonably thought that Ms Ms finances had moved on from whatever 
situation had caused the accounts to be defaulted. And I didnt think it was unreasonable for 
LS to be interested in Ms Ms more recent credit history for the purposes of assessing 
whether the loans were affordable. So, I didnt think that LSs credit checks should have 
caused it additional concerns. 
I could also see that the repayments that Ms M needed to make on Loan 1 were relatively 
modest compared to the income that shed declared to LS. The highest repayment amount 
for Loan 1 was £47.20. I didnt think the repayment amounts for Loan 1 were so large that 
its obvious they wouldve caused Ms M financial difficulty.So, given Ms Ms repayment amounts for Loan 1 and that this was her first loan with LS, I 
didnt think it wouldve been proportionate for LS to ask her for the amount of information that 
would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable. And at this stage, I didnt think it 
wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what Ms M was saying.  So, I didnt think LS 
was wrong to give Loan 1 to Ms M.
Ms M took out Loan 2 whilst Loan 1 was still outstanding. The loan amount and repayment 
amounts had significantly increased. But the total monthly repayment amounts for Loans 1 
and 2 were still relatively moderate compared to Ms Ms disposable income. And I didnt 
think the joint repayment amounts for Loans 1 and 2 were so large that its obvious they 
wouldve caused Ms M financial difficulty.
So, given Ms Ms repayment amounts for Loans 1 and 2, I didnt think it wouldve been 
proportionate for LS to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to show 
the lending was unsustainable. And overall at this stage, I didnt think it wouldve been 
proportionate to start verifying what Ms M was saying.  So, I didnt think LS was wrong to 
give Loan 2 to Ms M.
Ms M took out Loan 3 just two days after taking out Loan 2. Loans 1 and 2 were still 
outstanding. Ms M had asked for a loan of £400, but shed received the lower amount of 
£360. So, it appeared that LS had some concerns when assessing the loan amount. 
Nevertheless, the loan amount and repayment amounts were still higher than her previous 
loans. And the total repayment amounts on Loans 1 to 3 were a significant proportion of 
Ms Ms disposable income. 
I thought this might have caused LS some concerns and should have prompted the lender to 
do some additional checks such as gathering more information about Ms Ms other short 
term borrowing. As far as I could see it didnt do this.
So, I needed to think about what LS wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks 
before Loan 3. I could see from Ms Ms bank statements that she had at least seven other 
short term loans with seven other lenders that would have been repayable at the same time 
as Loan 3. I thought the extent of Ms Ms other short term borrowing would have put LS on 
notice that Ms M was having significant problems managing her money had it carried out 
proportionate checks here. So, as a responsible lender, LS would have declined Loan 3. So, 
I didnt think Loan 3 should have been provided to Ms M.
Ms M also said that she had received 32 statements of account from LS dated 
22 June 2020. So shed queried whether she might have had 32 loans from LS. She had 
provided this service with the account statements. Id been through these and it appeared 
that there were duplicate statements for Loans 8 and 24. So I still thought that Ms M had 
received 30 loans from LS.
As LS appeared to be disputing the balance outstanding from Ms M in its offer letter, I said 
that I intended to include a request in my redress for LS to provide Ms M with a detailed 
statement within 14 days of the date on which we told it Ms M accepted my final decision 
showing:
a) the payments she had made on Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 and
b) the balances of principal outstanding on these loans after those payment amounts 
had been treated as repayments of principal on the respective loans and the interest 
and fees had been removed from those loans in line with step 3 below. It was 
expected that the total outstanding principal balances would not exceed £563.46 in line with LSs account statements dated 22 June 2020, but payments made after that 
date should also be taken into account.
Subject to any further representations by Ms M or LS my provisional decision was that I 
intended to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to say that LS needed to pay Ms M 
some compensation relating to Loan 3 as well as Loans 4 to 30. So, I said that LS should put 
things right as follows:
putting things right  what LS needs to do
If LS has sold the outstanding debts on Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 it should buy these 
back if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If LS isnt able to buy the debts 
back, then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
1. LS should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms M towards interest, 
fees and charges on Loans 3 to 22 and 27 and 28, not including anything LS may have 
already refunded.
2. LS should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms M 
which were considered as part of 1., calculated from the date Ms M originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
3. Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 have not been fully repaid. In order to put Ms M back 
into the position she would have been had these not been agreed for her LS needs to 
ensure that Ms M only repays the principal borrowed. In other words, she should not 
pay any interest or charges for these loans. So, LS should remove all interest, fees and 
charges from the outstanding balances on Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30, and treat any 
payments made by Ms M towards these loans as payments towards the original capital 
borrowed. If reworking Ms Ms accounts on Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 as Ive 
directed results in Ms M effectively having made payments above the original capital 
borrowed on those accounts, then LS should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would 
have arisen, to the date of settlement. LS should then refund the amounts calculated in 
1. and 2. and move to step 6.
4. If reworking Ms Ms loan accounts leaves an amount of capital still to be paid on     
Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 then the amounts calculated in 1. and 2. can be used 
to repay any capital balances remaining on Loan 23 to 26 and 29 and 30. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Ms M. However, if there are still  
outstanding capital balances then LS should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Ms M.
5. As LS appears to be disputing the balance outstanding from Ms M in its offer letter, LS 
should provide Ms M with a detailed statement within 14 days of the date on which we 
tell it Ms M accepts my final decision showing:
a) the payments she has made on Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 and
b) the balances of principal outstanding on these loans after those payment 
amounts have been treated as repayments of principal on the respective loans 
and the interest and fees have been removed from those loans in line with step 3 
above. It is expected that the total outstanding principal balances will not exceed 
£563.46 in line with LSs account statements dated 22 June 2020, but payments 
made after that date should also be taken into account.6. LS should remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Ms credit file in relation to 
Loans 3 to 5. The overall pattern of Ms Ms borrowing for Loans 6 to 30 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so LS should remove these loans entirely 
from Ms Ms credit file. LS does not have to remove Loans 23 to 26 and 29 and 30 from 
Ms Ms credit file until these have been repaid, but LS should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these loans. 
*HMRC requires LS to take off tax from this interest. If Ms M asks LS for a certificate 
showing how much tax LS has taken off, it should provide this. If LS intends to use the 
refunds to reduce an amount Ms M owes, it must do this after tax.
LS hasnt provided a response to my provisional decision.
Ms M said she was happy with my provisional decision. But she has raised concerns 
about LSs delays in responding to and processing her complaint which she said caused 
her stress. She has asked for compensation for its unsatisfactory complaint handling.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
I note that Ms M is concerned about LSs delays in responding to and processing her 
complaint and that she has had to spend time chasing it for responses. She says all this has 
caused her stress. I appreciate Ms Ms frustration at the time taken by LS to resolve the 
complaint and can understand that she was caused stress by it. But complaint handling isnt 
a regulated activity. So, I shant be making any findings or ordering compensation to be paid 
in relation to any failings by LS in the way in which the complaint has been handled. If Ms M 
wishes to take her concerns about LSs complaint handling procedures further, she can raise 
these with the Financial Conduct Authority.
Otherwise as Ive not received any further information from the parties in respect of the 
matters set out in my provisional decision, Im not persuaded to change my findings from 
those set out in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold part of the complaint and 
require LS to pay Ms M some compensation and take the steps set out above.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint I order Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, to pay Ms M compensation 
and take the steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 October 2020.
