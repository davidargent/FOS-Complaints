The complaint
Mr M complained that U K Insurance Limited (UKI) had overcharged him for his premiums 
over the years for his car insurance.
What happened
Mr M had been insured with UKI for about 18 years when he changed his car on the policy in
2019. But when his insurance came up for renewal in 2020 his annual premium increased to
£507 which he thought was much higher than other people paid. So he chose to insure
instead with a different insurer, with breakdown cover included too, for £154.
He complained to UKI that they hadnt treated him fairly by charging him significantly higher
than the market premium and more than they would have charged a new customer. This
was despite him having been driving for over 30 years without a claim and having a low
annual mileage.
Mr M wanted UKI to agree that they hadnt treated him fairly and that they had overcharged 
him. He wanted them to compensate him or refund him the overcharged amounts. UKI didnt 
agree. They said that their premiums were correct and in line with their pricing structure. 
They also said that they had sent out annual renewal letters which clearly stated the 
premium, and latterly said that he should look around for competitive insurance.
The investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld. She thought the
premiums Mr M paid after 2015 were unfairly high and that UKI should refund them, plus
interest. 
UKI didnt agree and so the case was passed to me to decide. I issued 
provisional decisions on 27 June 2022 (the first provisional decision) and on 15 September 
2022( the second provision decision) .
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my second provisional decision I said as follows: 
 As the investigator explained, its not our role to regulate insurers, only to consider whether
an insurer has treated a policyholder fairly when pricing their policy. We dont stipulate any
right or wrong price an insurer has to charge for providing insurance. We recognise that
insurance pricing practices and insurance risk assessments have changed over time and
this impacts pricing. Even if UKIs premium has gone up, and other policies with other
insurers may be cheaper, that doesnt mean that UKI have done anything wrong. But UKI
must treat their customers fairly in deciding what premium to charge at renewal, and so must
look at how Mr M was engaging with the price at renewal each year.
We look carefully at complaints where a consumer has not spoken to the insurer after
receiving their renewal quotes from the same underwriter for more than four years. Mr M had
been insured with UKI since about 2002 but he hadnt been engaging with them between
about 2005 and about 2019. He said he didnt think that he needed to shop around for
insurance as hed been UKIs loyal customer for so many years.
But this changed in 2020 when he realised from talking to friends and family that he was
paying more than they were. He thinks that UKI have betrayed his loyalty, and that he must
have been paying higher premiums than he needed to for many years.
The investigator got UKI to send us details of the premiums Mr M paid during the policy and
the annual percentage increase.

The annual cost of Mr Ms policy was £138.00 when it started in 2002 but was £332.00 by
2018.
UKI said as follows. This wasnt a typical case of customer inertia. Although Mr M s
premiums went up in 2005 when he changed his car, they fluctuated between 2005 and
2014, and by 2014 his premium was less than it had been in 2005. So his premium didnt
increase in real terms for many years. And between 2010 and 2013 they applied a
discretionary discount of 10% discount to his premiums, so they were not taking advantage
of Mr Ms inertia. The premium increased in 2015 when affected by Mr Ms then credit score,
and subsequent increases were due to their view on risk. The 2019 and later premiums were
due to his car change. From about 2017 they advised customers to shop around with other
insurers. They confirmed that Mr M had never made any claim.
I think that UKI should have been aware that they were renewing Mr Ms policy every year
without any engagement from him. This was between 2005 and 2019. I do accept that his
premiums went up and down between 2005 and 2014 and overall didnt change too much in
real terms. But they did start to go up significantly from 2015. And so from that point UKI
need to justify that further annual premium increases were fair given his lack of engagement.
UKI claim that the 2015 increase was due to a change in Mr Ms credit score and thereafter
was due to their changed view of the risk and other factors, but I dont think that theyveshown us sufficient persuasive evidence to support that. And so I think that due to his inertia,
UKIs increase in the premiums from 2015 became unfair and this has disadvantaged Mr M.
This means that I think UKI should refund the difference between what he paid UKI for his
insurance in 2015 and what he paid for it each year after that, until he cancelled the policy in
2020, plus interest.
My provisional decision
For the reasons Ive given above, its provisional decision that I intend to uphold this
complaint and require U K Insurance Limited to :
Refund the difference between the price Mr M paid in 2015 and the price paid each
year from then until the policy cancellation date in 2020
Pay Mr M 8% simple interest per annum (less tax where applicable) on that amount
from the date of each instalment. 
Mr M didnt comment on my provisional decision. But UKI didnt agree with it. They repeated
that they had sent Mr M annual renewal letters stating the premium, which also from about
2017 said that he may be able to obtain alternative insurance cheaper elsewhere. But I still
think that, given that Mr M hadnt contacted them until 2019, UKI should have realised that
Mr M wasnt shopping around or negotiating the price at renewal each year.
UKI also took issue with the 2020 refund end date which I proposed. They said that in 2019
Mr Ms premium increased because he changed his car on the policy and that this was a
clear change in risk. Theyve shown us that this was justified by their underwriting criteria.
And so they thought that Mr Ms contact with them in 2019 ended any inertia on his part.
On reconsideration I agree with that. And so for that reason I change my provisional decision
and treat the 2019 date as the end of the inertia period, instead of the 2020 policy 
cancellation date.
My provisional decision
For the reasons Ive given above, its my provisional decision that I intend to uphold this
complaint and require U K Insurance Limited to :
Refund the difference between the price Mr M paid in 2015 and the price paid each
year from then until the date in 2019 that Mr M changed his car on his policy.
Pay Mr M 8% simple interest per annum (less tax where applicable) on that amount
from the date of each instalment*.
* If UKI consider that they are required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income 
tax from that interest, they should tell Mr M how much theyve taken off. They should 
also give Mr M a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax 
from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
In response to my second provisional decision, Mr M let us know that he wasnt subject to 
UK tax. 
UKI said that they didnt think that any premium refund at all was justified. They thought that 
the price inertia point should start only from 2015. This was because they felt that this 
Service had agreed that there was no unjustified increase in premium until 2015, and that 
UKIs premiums before then were fair. And they still felt that they had justified their premium 
increase from 2015 onwards.About the price inertia point, Mr M hadnt engaged with UKI since about 2005. We say its an 
inertia case if a consumer hasnt spoken to the business about their renewal quotes for five 
years or more, so Mr Ms inertia point was about five years after that. We think that a 
business should realise when a consumer isnt engaging with them. 
Id seen that Mr Ms premiums went up and down between 2005 and 2014 and overall didnt 
change too much in real terms, but that isnt the same as saying that those premiums were 
fair, and it doesnt change the inertia point. As the premiums started to go up significantly 
from 2015, its from that point that UKI need to justify that further annual premium increases 
were fair, given Mr Ms lack of engagement with them for about a decade before that. I think 
that in deciding what premium to charge him at renewal, they should have looked at how Mr 
M was not engaging with the price at renewal each year. 
UKI felt that theyd evidenced the premium increase from 2015 onwards. They said the  
2015 increase was partly due to a change in Mr Ms credit score and thereafter was due to 
their changed view of the risk and other factors.  But I dont think thats a good enough or 
sufficiently supported explanation and so Im not persuaded by it, and so I dont change my 
second provisional decision. 
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, its my final decision that I uphold this complaint. 
I require U K Insurance Limited to :
Refund the difference between the price Mr M paid in 2015 and the price paid each
year from then until the date in 2019 that Mr M changed his car on his policy.
Pay Mr M 8% simple interest per annum (less tax where applicable) on that amount
from the date of each instalment.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
