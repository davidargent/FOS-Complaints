K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that Active Securities Limited (trading as 247 Moneybox) gave him loans 
that he couldnt afford to repay.
background
Mr W borrowed from 247 Moneybox in two distinct chains.  He first borrowed in August and 
September 2010. Mr W then borrowed a further six loans from 247 Moneybox between 
August 2013 and February 2014. All of Mr Ws borrowing has been successfully repaid. 
A summary  of Mr Ws borrowing from 247 Moneybox is as follows;

Recently 247 Moneybox has confirmed that it considers that Mr Ws complaint about  the first 
two loans was made  too late and as a result we shouldnt consider them. Mr W has agreed 
to withdraw his complaint about these  loans. So the first two loans wont form part of this 
final decision, but I will of course take account  of them when considering the checks  
247 Moneybox needed  to perform on the later loans.
Mr Ws complaint  has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator thought  
that the checks 247 Moneybox did before agreeing  loans 3 to 5 had been sufficient. But he 
thought more checks should have  been done by 247 Moneybox  before the final three loans 
were agreed. And he thought that better checks would have shown that these loans werent  
affordable for Mr W. So he asked 247 Moneybox to pay Mr W some  compensation.
Disappointingly 247 Moneybox didnt respond to that assessment within a reasonable time. 
So, as the complaint hadnt been  resolved informally, it was passed  to me, an ombudsman, 
to decide. 247 Moneybox has recently said that it accepts the assessment that was made by 
our adjudicator, but I have decided to complete my final decision. This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr W accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN35837212247 Moneybox was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether 
Mr W could afford to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr W was borrowing, and his lending history,  but 
there was no set list of checks 247 Moneybox had to do.
247 Moneybox has told us about the checks it did before agreeing  the final six loans. It 
asked Mr W for details  of his income,  and normal expenditure. And it also checked  Mr Ws 
credit file before agreeing the loans. Although the credit checks  did show evidence  that Mr W 
had faced some problems repaying debt in the past, I dont think  this would have been  
sufficient to cause  any great additional concerns to the lender. And almost three years had 
passed since he had previously borrowed from 247 Moneybox.
The first three loans that Mr W took in 2013  were  relatively modest compared to the income 
that he declared. And they appeared to be easily  affordable based on what hed said about 
his expenditure.  So I think it was reasonable for the lender to base its affordability 
assessment on the information Mr W provided. I dont think it did anything wrong in agreeing 
these three  loans.
Mr W asked for his next loan (loan 6) just a few days after repaying  his previous borrowing. 
And the amount he asked to borrow had more than doubled. This was now his fourth loan 
request in as many  months. I think by now 247 Moneybox should  have  realised that it was 
unlikely that Mr Ws finances were as healthy as he was saying. I think  the lender  should 
have taken steps to independently verify Mr Ws true financial position. And I think the same 
checks would have  been proportionate  for the last two loans. They were both taken very 
shortly after a previous  loan had been  repaid. And the amounts Mr W asked to borrow 
remained consistently high in comparison to his declared income.
But although  I dont  think the checks 247 Moneybox did before agreeing  loans 6, 7 and 8 
were sufficient, that in itself doesnt mean that Mr Ws complaint should succeed. Id also 
need to be persuaded that what I consider to be proportionate  checks  would have shown 
247 Moneybox that Mr W couldnt  sustainably afford those loans. So Ive looked at Mr Ws 
bank statements, and what  hes told us about his financial  situation,  to see what better 
checks would have  shown  247 Moneybox.
Had 247 Moneybox  looked at Mr Ws actual financial  position  before agreeing  loans 6 to 8 it 
would have seen  that he was generally  earning a little more than hed declared. But it would 
also have seen that his normal expenditure was higher  than what  hed declared too. And it 
would have seen  that Mr W was borrowing regularly and in increasing  amounts  from several  
other short term lenders.  After taking all that into account Mr W had very little left over each  
month that he could  use to repay  his loans  from 247 Moneybox. 
If 247 Moneybox had done what  I consider  to be proportionate checks  before the final three  
loans I dont think it would have agreed  to lend to Mr W. So 247 Moneybox needs to pay him 
some compensation.
Ref: DRN35837213putting things right
I dont think 247 Moneybox should have  agreed to lend to Mr W after,  and including,  the loan 
that he took on 31 December 2013 (loan 6). So for each of those loans 247 Moneybox 
should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ws credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247 Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247 Moneybox must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Ws complaint and direct Active Securities Limited 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 February  2019.
