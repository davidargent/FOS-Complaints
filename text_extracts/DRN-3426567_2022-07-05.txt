The complaint
Mrs M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA arent providing sufficient 
information on receipts for items shes purchased.
What happened
Mrs M said that when she made purchases from an online marketplace using PayPal her 
receipts had provided details of who shed paid and what goods and/or services shed paid 
for. But now this is no longer being shown on the receipts shes been getting from PayPal. 
And she feels this leaves her open to fraud and disputes. She complained to PayPal.
PayPal said theyd explained the situation to Mrs M and didnt uphold her complaint.
 Mrs M wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator said that PayPal could only provide the details on the receipt that were 
made available to them. She didnt ask PayPal to do anything more.
Mrs M didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPal provides an online payment transfer system that allows users to send and receive 
payments online. Sellers on the online marketplace that Mrs M used for purchases had used 
PayPal as a payment method for the online marketplace she used. This meant their details 
were given to PayPal and could be shown on Mrs Ms receipts.
But from 2021, the online marketplace started operating their own systems to process 
payments. So where sellers on the on line marketplace may have always used PayPal as a 
payment method prior to this  the online marketplace now operates their own payment 
systems, known as  Managed Payments . This means the payment being made to the 
seller now goes to the online marketplace and its they that then pay the seller. This means 
the information about the seller is no longer provided to PayPal and so the details cant be 
shown on the receipt.
I can see that the online marketplace has explained the change in their process to Mrs M. 
And as they are the providers of the information given to PayPal, I cant say PayPal has 
done anything wrong, so I cant ask them to provide information to Mrs M that they dont 
have.
I know this is disappointing for Mrs M and she is concerned she may become a victim of 
fraud. But  PayPal offers buyers and sellers protection on purchases. Buyers such as Mrs M 
who have used PayPal to make purchases can raise a dispute under PayPals Buyer 
Protection scheme where the seller hasnt
delivered the goods which have been paid for; or 
delivered goods which are "significantly not as described". 
PayPal has also given reassurance about Mrs Ms concerns about whether the payment 
would be for goods and services and said this information can be seen by Mrs M before 
and after she goes through checkout and is included in the transaction details.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 August 2022.
