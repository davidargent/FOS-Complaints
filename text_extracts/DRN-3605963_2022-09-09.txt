The complaint
Mr V complains that National Westminster Bank Plc denied his claim for compensation for 
being mis-sold solar panels which he purchased with his debit card.
Background
In 2012 Mr V bought solar panels for his home and paid for them with his NatWest debit 
card. A couple of years later he realised that the panels were not performing as well as the 
salesman had led him to expect, and he concluded that they had been misrepresented to 
him. In 2021 he contacted NatWest and asked for a refund.
NatWest refused. It told him that it was too late for it to raise a chargeback, as there was a 
time limit for doing so and this had run out. Mr V asked to raise a claim under the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974, but NatWest said this did not apply as he had not bought the panels with 
credit provided by NatWest.
Mr V brought this complaint to our service, but our adjudicator agreed with NatWests 
stance. Mr V asked for an ombudsmans decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it, for broadly the same reasons that were given by the 
adjudicator.
Mr V has no remedy available to him under the Consumer Credit Act because he was not 
provided with credit by NatWest. The only remedy he might have had at the time is 
chargeback, but that is subject to strict time limits which expired long ago. The time limit 
under the Visa chargeback scheme is usually 120 days from the transaction, or sometimes 
120 days from the date when the problem was discovered but subject to a longstop of 540 
days from the date of the transaction. But it appears that Mr V first approached NatWest 
about this matter 3,359 days after the date of purchase, which is simply far too late.
It follows that NatWest did nothing wrong in declining Mr Vs claim for a refund.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
