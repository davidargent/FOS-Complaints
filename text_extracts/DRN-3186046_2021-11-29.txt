DRN-3186046
The complaint
Mr and Mrs A complain about Fairmead Insurance Limiteds decision to turn down their 
buildings insurance claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy covers certain events known as insured perils. Therefore, for a claim to 
be payable, Mr and Mrs A would need to show that the damage was caused by one 
of those perils.
Mr and Mrs A say the damage to their chimney happened because of high winds. 
However, Fairmead says the damage happened because the cement mortar had 
deteriorated, and this was due to a lack of maintenance. Fairmead turned down the 
claim because it said an insured peril hadnt occurred.
The policy does cover storm damage, and so Ive first of all considered whether there 
were storm conditions when the damage happened. The policy terms explain that 
wind speeds would need to be at least 55mph to be considered a storm. 
Ive checked local weather reports, however there werent storm conditions recorded 
at the time of damage. That means the damage cant be considered under the storm 
peril.
As the damage doesnt fall under any other insured peril, and Mr and Mrs A dont 
have accidental damage cover, Im satisfied that Fairmeads decision to turn down 
the claim was reasonable. 
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A and Mrs A to 
accept or reject my decision before 27 December 2021.
