The complaint
Mr and Ms D complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 claims that theyve made. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr and Ms D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money Consumer Lending in 
January 2009 to pay for a timeshare. The total amount of credit provided to them was £9,699 
and they agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £180.80 to GE Money Consumer 
Lending. The loan was repaid in September 2011. 
Mr and Ms D complained to GE Money Consumer Lending in June 2020 that the timeshare 
company wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange the loan. GE Money Consumer Lending 
said that the complaint was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 but that the timeshare 
company was authorised to carry out regulated activities. 
Mr and Ms Ds representative then made a complaint in February 2021 about a number of 
issues, including that the timeshare company wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the 
timeshare had been misrepresented to Mr and Ms D, no credit checks were carried out and 
the interest rate was high. It also referred to an overseas court judgment which commented 
on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the timeshare company. 
That complaint was made directly to this service so it was forwarded to GE Money 
Consumer Lending. It issued a detailed response to that complaint in which it said, amongst 
other things, that the claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Ms Ds complaint should be upheld. He 
considered their claims under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but thought that they 
were raised too late and he couldnt conclude that section 32 of the Limitation Act extended 
the time limit. He also said that he hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to show that the 
loan was unaffordable for Mr and Ms D.
Mr and Ms Ds representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that:
the claim is also made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act;
the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of the businesss 
decision;
the misrepresentations by the timeshare company were fraudulently made so the 
time limit for a claim is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation Act;
the timeshare company wasnt authorised to arrange the loan; and
the timeshare was an unauthorised collective investment scheme.
I have issued a separate decision in which I described why this service doesnt have the 
power to consider Mr and Ms Ds complaint about GE Money Consumer Lendings response 
to their section 75 claim. In this decision Ive set out my findings on its response to their 
section 140A claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Ms Ds complaint about GE Money 
Consumer Lendings response to their section 140A claim shouldnt be upheld for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Ms Ds complaint is that GE Money Consumer Lending turned down their 
section 140A claim and I accept that they referred their complaint to this service 
within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 
applies to their claim;
Im not determining the outcome of their claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that - Im considering whether or not GE Money Consumer Lendings 
response to their claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
GE Money Consumer Lending says that the loan agreement ended in September 
2011 so Mr and Ms D would have had six years from then to bring a claim against 
either the timeshare company or GE Money Consumer Lending  but a claim wasnt 
made to GE Money Consumer Lending until February 2021, more than nine years 
later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider 
that their claim under section 140A is now time-barred; 
Mr and Ms Ds representative says that the timeshare is an unauthorised collective 
investment scheme and that the timeshare company acted as an unauthorised 
broker  but Im not persuaded that the timeshare was an unauthorised collective 
investment scheme as Mr and Ms D acquired holiday rights, so even if there was an 
investment element (and I make no finding on that), I consider that it would fall 
outside of the definition of an unauthorised collective investment scheme;
GE Money Consumer Lending says that the timeshare company had the requisite 
authorities in place, initially under its Office of Fair Trading licence, which 
subsequently transferred to an interim permission from the Financial Conduct 
Authority and full permission was then granted for it to carry out regulated activities  
and Im not persuaded that Mr and Ms Ds representative has provided enough evidence to show that the timeshare company acted as an unauthorised broker in 
arranging the loan to Mr and Ms D;
Mr and Ms Ds representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the 
timeshare company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the structure of those companies was unlawful and I consider that any such 
claim would now also be time-barred;
Mr and Ms Ds representative says that no credit checks were carried out by GE 
Money before the loan was made to Mr and Ms D  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the loan was unaffordable for them and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
they complained to GE Money Consumer Lending that no credit checks had been 
carried out or asked it for any information about the affordability assessments before 
February 2021  as the loan was made to them in January 2009 and ended in 
September 2011, I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the 
affordability of the loans would now be time-barred; 
Mr and Ms Ds representative says that the high interest rate that Mr and Ms D were 
expected to pay is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mr and Ms D 
signed the loan agreement which clearly set out the annual rate of interest (and the 
APR), the amount of credit, the total charge for credit and the monthly repayment and 
immediately above their signatures it says This is a Credit Agreement regulated by 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its 
terms  the agreement also set out their right to cancel the loan agreement but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they tried to do so within the cancellation period;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Ms D were 
unduly pressured into buying the timeshare or entering into the loan agreement or 
that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  
they didnt complain to GE Money Consumer Lending about those issues until 
February 2021  more than twelve years after they entered into the loan agreement 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to GE 
Money Consumer Lending about any such issues before then;
GE Money Consumer Lending issued a substantive response to Mr and Ms Ds 
claims in June 2021  I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to apply the 
provisions of the Limitation Act in response to their section 140A claim and Im not 
persuaded that the outcome that its reached is unfair or unreasonable in these 
circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr and Ms D for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money Consumer Lending 
to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Ms Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D and Ms D to 
accept or reject my decision before 3 November 2022.
