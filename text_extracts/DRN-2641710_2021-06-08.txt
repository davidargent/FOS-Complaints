The complaint
Mr G complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refused to refund an online payment he 
says he didnt make. He wants PayPal to refund the payment.
What happened
Mr G held a PayPal account. In 2020 he says his bank contacted him following suspicious 
payments on his bank account. It asked if he recognised several transactions made through 
PayPal, which he says he didnt. His bank refunded two of the transactions, but not the third, 
so Mr G contacted PayPal for the payment to be refunded.
PayPal refused to refund the payment. It said Mr G needed to log on to his PayPal account 
and verify his payment using a card issued by his bank. There wasnt a satisfactory 
explanation as to how someone else could have accessed his PayPal account and known 
his card information. And the merchant who received the payment provided evidence 
showing Mr G received the item he purchased  an online game - to his email address.
Mr G brought his complaint to our service. An investigator decided not to uphold his 
complaint. In summary, they found:
- Mr G more likely than not consented to buy the game. He has a history of paying for 
online games, which he downloads onto his personal computer.
- Mr G said he gave no-one else access to his PayPal account, and his PayPal 
password is different to the passwords he has for other accounts. So, there wasnt a 
clear point of compromise to explain how someone else could have logged on to his 
PayPal account to verify the payment.
- The other information PayPal held indicated Mr G logged on to his PayPal account to 
verify the payment.
Mr G disagreed with the outcome. He said the internet protocol (IP) address used to log on 
to his account was not his and related to an area where he doesnt live. And he said both his 
bank and PayPal had commented on the payments being suspicious. He asked for a final 
decision from an ombudsman, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint. Ill explain why:
- PayPal only needs to refund a payment if its customer didnt consent to the payment. 
Mr G says he didnt purchase the game, and its possible this is true. But I must 
decide what I think is most likely to have happened. And I find the balance of 
evidence indicates Mr G most likely consented to the payment.
- Mr Gs spending activity shows he buys games online. Many of the merchants he 
buys from are similar in nature, including the merchant who received the payments 
which his bank refunded. Among other things the merchants sell keys to download 
games. So, after a purchase is made, a customer is sent a key to their email address 
to download a game 
- Mr G had bought from the merchant before; his payment history shows this. So, he 
clearly had an existing customer relationship with it.
- The merchant provided evidence to PayPal that it sent Mr G a key to download a 
popular game to his email address. It also holds Mr Gs home address. Although Mr 
G says the key could be downloaded anywhere, I think its more likely it was sent to 
the email address the merchant holds for him, rather than anywhere else.
- Online customer reviews of merchants who operate in this market indicate some of 
the keys sold to customers do not work or have already been used. And there are 
complaints about merchants not being very helpful when customers raise claims. So, 
its possible Mr G paid for the game, but it didnt work. But I havent considered 
PayPals liability on this point any further because this is not what Mr G said 
happened.
- Mr G says the IP address used to log on to his PayPal account isnt his. While this 
could indicate someone else logged on to his PayPal account, its easy for IP 
addresses to be masked. And, its also possible Mr G was in a different location 
when the purchase was made, or he allowed someone to purchase a game who lives 
elsewhere. So, I dont find his point persuasive when weighed against the other 
available information.
- Mr Gs bank decided to refund the other payments, but it didnt refund the last 
payment due to Mr G having a previous customer relationship with the merchant. So, 
I have not placed much weight on the previous refunds. Mr G says his bank and 
PayPal told him the payments were suspicious but based on the evidence before me 
Im satisfied PayPals decision not to refund the last payment is reasonable.
For the reasons I have given, I am not upholding Mr Gs complaint, so I am not going to 
direct PayPal to refund the payment or pay compensation.
My final decisionI have decided not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2021.
