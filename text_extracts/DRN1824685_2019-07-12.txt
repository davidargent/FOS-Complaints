Miss M says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to her.
background 
This complaint is about 38 short term loans Sunny provided to Miss M between May 2016  
and December 2017. All the loans have been repaid. The loans were repayable by six 
monthly instalments.  As Sunny has offered to settle  Loans 18 onwards,  I have  only provided 
details of Loans 1 to 17 below. Miss Ms lending  history is as follows:

Our adjudicator recommended  that Miss Ms complaint should be upheld in part. He said that 
Loans 6 onwards shouldnt have been  given  to Miss M. 
Sunny disagreed. But it offered to settle  Loans  18 to 38. It said that Miss M had been paying  
interest on her loans for over 12 months by Loan 18 so it was possible she was reliant on 
credit by this time. Sunny also said that its affordability assessment was sufficiently robust  
and proportionate on its decisions up to Loan  17. It also said that the loan amounts up to 
Loan 6 werent  increasing, although  it acknowledged  that Miss M was paying  more than one 
loan at a time. But Sunny  said there was no evidence of detriment to Miss M.
Miss M rejected Sunnys  offer so the complaint has been passed  to me, an ombudsman, to 
assess.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
I note that Sunny has offered  to provide a refund of interest paid by Miss M on Loans 18 
Ref: DRN18246852to 38 and pay statutory  interest on those refunds. It also offered to remove  the entries  about 
those loans from Miss Ms credit  file. It doesnt  appear that Miss M paid any charges on 
those loans for which a refund would also be required. So, except for ordering Sunny to 
provide the offered redress later in this decision, I wont make  any other findings about those 
loans here.
When Sunny  lent to Miss M the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and 
relevant regulations and guidance  included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC).  The 
CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the CONC defines sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties 
and in particular  the consumer should be able to make repayments, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Ref: DRN18246853Sunny did a number  of checks  before  it lent to Miss M. It asked her for details of her income 
and expenditure.  Miss Ms declared  income  for all the loans was £1,453.  Miss M declared 
her expenditure as between £556  and £985  from Loan 1 until Loans 17. 
Sunny also checked  Miss Ms credit file before  agreeing to the loans. It has provided  us with 
a summary of the results of its credit  checks including Miss Ms other credit commitments. 
Miss M needed to make monthly loan repayment amounts of around  £16 to £31 to Sunny for 
Loans 1 to 4. But Miss M also had one other loan from Sunny outstanding  when she took out 
Loans 2 and 3, and two other loans  outstanding  from Sunny when she took out Loan 4. So, I 
note that the total monthly repayments due were around £58, £45, and £76 for Loans 2 to 4 
respectively. But I think  these were relatively modest compared to Miss Ms declared 
disposable income. 
Ive also looked  at the results of Sunnys credit checks before Loans 1 to 4 and they dont 
show any information that I think should have  caused additional concerns to Sunny.
Given Miss Ms repayment amounts, what was apparent about her circumstances  at the 
time, and her history  with the lender, I dont think it wouldve  been  proportionate for Sunny to 
ask her for the amount  of information  that would be needed to show Loans 1 to 4 were  
unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Miss M provided before Loans 1 to 4 or the 
information Sunny shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been  proportionate to 
start verifying what she was saying.  So I dont think Sunny was wrong  to give Loans 1 to 4 to 
Miss M. 
But as Loan 5 was Miss Ms fifth loan in less than four months, I think Sunny should  have  
been concerned  that Miss M might have been  reliant  on its lending. And I dont think it was 
reasonable for Sunny to base its assessment before Loan 5 on the information  provided by 
Miss M without taking steps to independently check what shed declared. So I think it might  
have been proportionate  at this time for Sunny to have independently  reviewed the true state  
of Miss Ms finances. 
I would normally look at the borrowers bank  statements to see what  proportionate checks 
would likely  have shown.  Unfortunately  Ive not seen Miss Ms bank statements for the 
month before Loan 5. I note that the adjudicator  had asked Miss M for her bank statements 
in July 2018 so she has had ample time to provide these.  Although  Miss M has provided us 
with her credit report, this isnt sufficient for me to work out what  her financial position was 
like at the relevant  times. So I cant say that if Sunny had completed sufficient checks,  it 
would have found that Miss M couldnt  afford  to repay Loan  5 sustainably. So I cant say that 
Sunny was wrong to give Loan  5 to Miss M. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending with Miss M to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN18246854Even though  the loan amount for Loan  6 was £50 less than her previous loan, I think  
her repeated and regular  borrowing from Sunny by Loan 6 should have put the 
lender on notice that Miss M might  be experiencing some  financial pressures. 
Loan 6 was provided two days after Miss M took out Loan 5. At that point she had 
already borrowed  two other loans from Sunny. So she needed to make  repayments 
on three loans at the same time. I think all this should have caused some concerns  to 
Sunny.
I can see that as Sunny  didnt stop lending  at this point, Miss M went on to take out another 
32 loans in the following 15 months. I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to 
provide borrowing from Loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Miss Ms ability 
to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
The fact that the loans  were  repaid does not mean that they were  repaid sustainably, 
or without causing Miss M undue difficulty. 
Ive also noted  that Sunny  said it had carried out a sufficiently robust and proportionate  
affordability assessment  for the loans until Loan 17, and it said there was no evidence of 
detriment to Miss M. But I think Sunny will (or ought to) know from previous decisions (as 
well as whats set out on our website)  that there are cases where this service considers the 
overall lending  pattern  and not just the affordability of each  loan. And there will be times 
when the pattern of lending alone is enough  to indicate that a consumer is likely to be in 
financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should relending  continue. 
And when  a consumer  borrows  numerous  loans over a long period of time, its most likely 
that the loans  arent being used  for their intended  purpose of temporary cash flow problems. 
As Sunny will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter  to CEOs of high cost lending  
firms that a high volume of relending..may  be symptomatic  of unsustainable lending 
patterns. And I think that is the case here.
So, I think that Sunny needs to pay Miss M some compensation relating to Loans  6 to 17 
along with what  it has already offered in relation  to Loans 18 to 38. So Sunny should put 
things right as follows.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny should:-
 1. Refund all interest and any charges Miss M paid on Loans 6 onwards;
 2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
     they  were paid to the date of settlement*;
 3. Remove all entries about Loans  6 onwards from Miss Ms credit file.
Ref: DRN18246855* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
 Miss M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Elevate  Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, to:-
 1. Refund all interest and any charges Miss M paid on Loans 6 onwards;
 2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
     they  were paid to the date of settlement*;
 3. Remove all entries about Loans  6 onwards from Miss Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
 Miss M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2019.
