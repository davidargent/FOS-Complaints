The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc, trading as NatWest, closed his bank 
accounts and added a default to his credit file. And hed like this removed. 
What happened
Mr R had a current account, some savings accounts and a Credit card with NatWest.
Between the 1 February 2019 and the 21 February 2019 NatWest restricted access to 
Mr Rs accounts. And on the 25 February 2019 NatWest sent Mr R a letter advising him 
theyd be closing his accounts within 60 days.
In May 2019 NatWest notified Mr R that his accounts were closed and because hed not 
settled the overdraft debt from his current account theyd be passing his account to their 
recoveries department. 
In September 2019 NatWest recorded a default against Mr Rs credit file. Mr R settled the 
debt in full in May 2020. 
Mr R wasnt happy with NatWests actions so complained to the bank. In particular he was 
unhappy that NatWest hadnt advised him of the outstanding balance of just over Â£11,000 on 
his current account whereas they had sent out a statement on his credit card. Which hed 
paid in full. He thought it unfair NatWest had moved the account to their recoveries 
department.
NatWest didnt uphold his complaint. They advised that the accounts had been restricted 
and closed within the terms and conditions. And theyd made it clear in the account closure 
notification that the overdraft needed to be paid within 60 days of the date of the letter  but 
Mr R hadnt made contact to discuss this.
Mr R didnt accept NatWests conclusion so complained to our service. Hed learnt that in 
September 2019 NatWest recorded a default on his credit file and he explained that this was 
preventing him from obtaining a mortgage. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Rs complaint. But they concluded that NatWest 
hadnt acted unfairly in restricting and closing his account or reporting the default to Credit 
Reference Agencies. 
Mr R wasnt happy with our investigators conclusions. And in response said hes not 
challenging the banks decision to close his accounts. But he doesnt think the loading of the 
default is fair. In summary he said:
He has no outstanding debts or loans and hes always paid his bills on time.
The bank didnt inform him how much he owed and when he needed to make 
repayments. 
Hes paid the debt in full including all interest and charges; and
Hed like the default removed. 
As Mr R didnt accept our investigators outcome, its been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator for similar reasons. 
Ive explained why below. 
Mr Rs explained in his response to our investigators outcome that hes not complaining 
about NatWests decision to restrict or close his accounts  instead he remains unhappy 
about the reporting of the default. And hed like this removed. Id like to confirm that Im in 
agreement with our investigator in saying that NatWest followed the terms and conditions of 
Mr Rs accounts when restricting his access and closing them. And therefore acted fairly.  
So its left for me to consider the fairness of the default loading on Mr Rs credit file. 
On the 25 February 2019 NatWest wrote to Mr R to explain all his accounts would be closed 
within 60 days. They also stated within that letter:
We formally demand repayment of any funds owed to the bank at the end of 60 days from 
the date of this letter, failing which the bank will follow its normal debt recovery procedures. 
Please note that unless satisfactory repayment is received within 60 days of this letter, 
performance of your account may be reporting to the following Credit Reference Agencies.
  
Im satisfied that this paragraph within the letter sent to Mr R on the 25 February 2019 
makes it clear to Mr R that NatWest may report information to Credit Reference Agencies if 
any debt isnt settled within 60 days. Mr R accepts he was aware that he was using his 
overdraft at the time the account was closed, and he agrees he made no attempt to contact 
NatWest about this outstanding debt. I see no reason why Mr R wouldnt have been aware 
of the size of the debt because he was receiving monthly statements. Mr R argues that 
NatWest should have sent him a letter to notify him of the exact outstanding amount  as 
they did for his Credit Card. However, Im afraid I dont agree with this assessment. I think 
the letter makes it clear that NatWest will no longer be providing the accounts or overdraft 
facility and Mr R needs to take action to either fully repay the balance or come to an 
arrangement with the bank. However Mr R failed to do this  and I see nothing that 
prevented him from doing so. 
 
Mr R has argued that hes always paid other debts on time, he has no outstanding debts and 
he repaid the overdraft in full. Im satisfied that Mr R did fully repay the debt in May 2020. 
However, this doesnt lead me to conclude that the default was loaded unfairly. I say this as 
the bank has a responsibility to report accurate information about a customers financial 
situation to Credit Reference Agencies. Mr R didnt repay the debt or make arrangements 
with NatWest within the stated 60 days. And even once hed been notified that the account 
would be moved to recoveries, in May 2019, it took Mr R 12 months until the debt was 
settled. This indicates to me that even if Mr R had contacted NatWest to discuss the 
outstanding overdraft the repayment timeframe may not have been acceptable to the bank. 
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest acted fairly in recording the default. And I wont be asking 
them to do anything further.
My final decisionMy final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 January 2021.
