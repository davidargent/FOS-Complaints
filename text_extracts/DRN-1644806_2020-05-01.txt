The complaint
Mr M complains that Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as V12 Retail Finance, won't refund to 
him the money that he paid for some hearing aids. He's being helped with his complaint by a 
representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M would only have a right to claim against V12 Retail Finance in these 
circumstances if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier of the hearing aids - so to be able to uphold his complaint about V12 Retail 
Finance I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier and that V12 Retail Finance's response to his claim 
wasnt fair or reasonable;
Mr M complained to the supplier about the hearing aids and it sent him a detailed 
response in March 2019 which described the steps that had been taken in the year 
since he'd bought them;
it said that the hearing aids were appropriate for Mr M's hearing loss, it had rectified 
any issues through repair or advice and wasn't able to refund him - but would
like to continue to work with him to resolve any issues and provide ongoing support;
Mr M says that he was advised by another supplier that the hearing aids weren't 
suitable for him and he's provided a report from that supplier;
Mr M clearly isn't satisfied with the hearing aids and says that he doesn't use them;
I sympathise with him for the issues that he's had with the hearing aids and for the 
other difficulties that he's described - but I'm not persuaded that there's enough 
evidence to show that the hearing aids weren't suitable for him, weren't fit for purpose 
or weren't of satisfactory quality - so I'm not persuaded that there's been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the hearing aids;
I consider that the supplier's, and V12 Retail Finance's, responses to him have been 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances and that the supplier says that it will work 
with him to resolve any issues and provide ongoing support; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require V12 Retail Finance to end 
the loan agreement, to refund to Mr M the money that he paid for the hearing aids or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
 
My final decisionFor these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr M's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
