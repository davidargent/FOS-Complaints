K820x#14complaint
Mr and Ms W complain  that Santander  UK Plc caused them  a loss in the way it managed  the 
sale of their property after it was repossessed. Mr and Ms W want  compensation because 
Santander didnt  accept the better offer for the property that was available.  
background
Mr and Ms W separated and their mortgage account  was in arrears. Santander repossessed 
Mr and Ms Ws home in November 2016. Santander had a survey  done with a projected 
market value (PMW) of £610,000. Santander  also got valuations from three estate agents 
who valued the property at £695,000, £695,000 and £730,000 Santander has provided  
information about the progress of the sale which I will summarise as follows:
In January 2017 it got an offer for £500,000  which  Santander rejected.
It got two further offers in January  2017 for £675,000  and £690,000. It accepted the 
higher offer and issued a memorandum of sale on 20 January.
In February, Santander got a higher offer of £710,000 and Santander approached the 
existing buyer to see if that offer would be increased  but it wasnt. Santander  continued 
with the offer of £710,000 on 21 February but this offer was withdrawn on 24 February 
and Santander  continued with the offer of £690,000. But this offer was withdrawn on 9 
May as the potential  buyers had offered on another property.
 On 1 June 2017  an offer of £700,000 was received on condition  that the property was 
removed from the market
 On 20 June 2017 Santander received an offer of £710,000 but as Santander  had no 
proof of the funding  it rejected the offer.
On 22 June 2017, Santander issued  a memorandum of sale and draft contract for the 
offer of £700,000 to the purchaser  I shall call Buyer 1.
On 28 June 2017 Santander got an offer of £730,000 from a purchaser  I shall call Buyer 
2 but as proof of funds wasnt provided the offer was rejected.
On 10 July 2017, Buyer 2 re-submitted their offer of £730,000 with evidence  of funding. 
Santander approached Buyer 1 to see if they would increase  their offer and Buyer 2 was 
asked for their best offer. Buyer  2 increased its offer to £740,000 and Buyer  1 increased 
to £725,000.
 Buyer 1 was asked  if it would increase its offer further and on 20 July 2017 increased 
the offer to £730,000.
On 24 July 2017, both buyers were asked for their best offers.
On 27 July 2017, Buyer 1 said they were sticking at £730,000 and could exchange the 
following week. Buyer 2 stuck at £740,000  
On 28 July 2017 Santander  agreed  to go ahead with the higher offer from Buyer 2.
Exchange of contracts was to take place on 11 August but this didnt happen so 
Santander says the property was put on the market  again  in September.
In October Buyer 2 reduced its offer to £700,000.
In November Santanders agents  reported  that there was no further interest  in the 
property since the price reduction  and the property was sold to Buyer  2 for £700,000. 
The sale took place  on 1 December 2017.The balance on the mortgage at that stage was 
£730,604.54 and after the net proceeds were  added to the account, the shortfall   facing Mr 
and Ms W was £42,482.06. 
Ref: DRN70482362Mr and Ms W say that Santander should have proceeded with the offer from Buyer 1 to 
exchange in July 2017 for £730,000 which was at a higher price than Santander eventually 
got and would have saved  them interest  due to the delay in completing the sale.  Mr and 
Ms W also say that Santanders agents caused  damage to the property. Our investigator 
didnt recommend that this complaint should  be upheld as he felt Santander  had tried to get 
the best possible price  for the house. He also said that there was no evidence that 
Santanders agents caused  damage  to the house or that such damage  devalued  the 
property. Mr and Ms W disagreed and asked  for a review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint is brought by the joint mortgage  holders who are separated.  Although I 
understand there were three valuations on the property from estate agents ranging  from 
£695,000 to £730,000,  Ive not been supplied with these. The only valuation I have was a 
PMW commissioned  by Santander which shows a valuation  of £610,000. Although I 
understand that Ms W wasnt informed about the progress of the sale Ive summarised it 
above from the documents and emails  provided to me by Santander.
The critical issue is that in July, Santander  went with an offer from Buyer 2 for a purchase at 
£740,000, rather  than Buyer 1 at a lower price, that didnt lead to a sale at the higher price 
and the bank eventually sold to Buyer 2 for £40,000  less in December. Although Santander 
switched from Buyer 1 to Buyer  2 on the basis that the exchange of contracts would take 
place by 11 August,  that exchange  hadnt  taken place by 26 October when Buyer 2 then 
dropped his price  by £40,000. Santander says that The decision to swap  buyers  was made  
based on the information we had at that time particularly that the higher offer of £740,000 
could exchange  one week later than the £730,000 offer.
In July Santander had agreed  the sale to Buyer  1 for £700,000 with an exchange deadline of 
20 July. On 17 July an offer came in from Buyer 2 for £740,000. Buyer 1 at that stage agreed 
to pay £725,000 and later £730,000. Santander had engaged an agent to handle  the 
repossession and sale which in turn engaged estate agents. Its agent, in an email of 17 July, 
recommended that the higher offer from Buyer 2 should be declined.  The reason given was 
that Buyer 1 had completed  its searches  and just needed an amended mortgage offer and 
could exchange  the following week. The agent had concerns about Buyer 2 as it was a 
previous bidder who had asked for a delay in completion for 9 months to sell its property was 
self-employed and may have difficulty getting a mortgage. The agent  was obviously 
concerned that matters  might drag on and that is not good in a repossession sale as the 
interest on the mortgage that the customer will face continues until the sale takes place. 
Santander went for the highest bidder, Buyer 2, for the reason that it believed  that there 
would then be a surplus to the customer. I can understand,  despite its agents concern why 
Santander would agree to the higher offer from Buyer 2 as the higher  price would benefit Mr 
and Ms W. I also note that in accepting  Buyer 2s bid and because  of its agents  concerns 
that Santander then tried to insure that there was an early exchange of contracts  which was 
to take place on 11 August. The problem that seems  to have developed, according to the 
notes, was that the valuer for Buyer 2 was unable to conduct a valuation  until the 23 August.I 
did consider whether it would be reasonable to have expected Santander to withdraw the 
contract from Buyer 2 on 11 August. But August  is the busy time for house sales and a busy 
Ref: DRN70482363time for valuers. So, although  Santander could have pulled out at this stage I dont think  that 
it was unreasonable to delay waiting for the exchange of contracts pending that valuation.  
Santander agreed with its agents that if exchange hadnt taken place by 30 August that the 
property should  be remarketed by the start of September which  I consider was a reasonable 
response.  
As exchange didnt  take place, according  to the contact notes, the property was put on the 
market again in September. There is no record of any further bids on the property. It seems  
that Buyer 2s solicitors had still got the contract at least until the end of September. As 
Buyer 2 still had an outstanding bid on the property of £740,000,  Santander  presumably 
hoped that he would  eventually buy at that price. There is no evidence that Santander or its 
agents tried to contact  Buyer  1 in September although it seems  to have tried to make 
contact in October.  I simply dont know why that was or indeed  what  Buyer 1s response 
might have been. I see that in an email of 27 July 2017 that the agents said that Buyer  1 at 
that stage was looking at alternative  properties and so may indeed  have got one by 
September. I also assume that if the property was put on the market  again in September that 
Buyer 1 would have  had the opportunity to bid on the property again but appears not to have 
done so. 
At the end of October  the agents told Santander that although the sale was agreed with 
Buyer 2 for £740,000  that Buyer 2 had come back with a revised offer of £700,000. The 
email from Buyer  2 identified a number of issues with the property. The agents  said that they 
asked for a survey to respond  to these issues but noted that the buyer  himself  was a 
surveyor and did not have a formal report. The agents recommended  this offer was accepted  
as the revised  offer was £90,000 in excess of the PMV. I would have  concerns  about 
Santander using  the PMV  as a guide  as from the estate  agents valuations and the bidding 
activity on this property  that its market  value was clearly above £610,000. 
But there is no evidence  that from September onwards  that there were any further  
expressions of interest in the property to indicate that it would sell for higher than £700,000 
and of course any delay  in the sale would mean Mr and Ms W facing  higher  interest  charges. 
Ms W suggests that Buyer 2 may have benefited from some sharp practice between Buyer 2 
and the asset  management company. I can see that Buyer  2 was in a strong position when 
Buyer 1 dropped out but the grounds for Santander favouring Buyer  2 in July/August were to 
benefit Mr and Ms W and I cant find fault with that. 
As Buyer 2 was the only potential purchaser  in October/November 2017  and was offering a 
price within the range  that its agents  had valued the property I dont consider that it was 
unreasonable for Santander to sell the property at the price it did. 
Ms W has expressed  concerns  that some damage  to the property may have affected its 
price but there is no evidence of that and I dont believe that any lack of action  by Santander 
or its agents devalued  the property. I am concerned that Santander seems not to have  told 
Ms W about the sale and the shortfall  she would  have  to face until after she contacted 
Santander in May 2018 although  the property sold in December 2017. I see that Santander 
has offered Ms W compensation of £100  for that which I consider reasonable. I will leave it 
to her to make  contact  with Santander  if she wishes to accept it.  
But I appreciate  that Mr and Ms Ws main  concern is with the way Santander  marketed the 
property and that it could have been  sold for £30,000 more than it eventually  sold for and 
earlier than it did. I have  set out in the background the bidding process and it appears to me 
that Santander marketed the property to get the best possible price. Santander decided to 
Ref: DRN70482364go with Buyer 2 on reasonable  grounds  at the time in the interests of Mr and Ms W. As, of 
course, Buyer 1 had only made an offer and not entered a contract there is no certainty in 
any case that Buyer 1 would have completed  the purchase for the higher price offered. 
Having examined  the matter in detail I cant fairly say that Santander did anything wrong and 
I cant fairy uphold this complaint. 
my decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Ms W to 
accept or reject my decision  before  13 December  2019.
