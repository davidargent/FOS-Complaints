K820x#14complaint
Mrs T complains about three chargebacks  that have been  made  against  her business 
account by WorldPay  (UK) Limited.  
background
Mrs T had a business account with WorldPay  until she closed  it in November 2018. Mrs T 
received a chargeback letter from WorldPay in October 2017 which said that a card payment 
of £950 that had been made to her business in September 2017 hadnt  been authorised  by 
the account holder so it was debiting  the payment from her account.  Mrs T complained to 
WorldPay and it issued  its final response to her in November 2017. 
Mrs T received further chargeback letters from WorldPay in October and November 2017 
about other payments that had been made to her business in September 2017  but hadnt  
been authorised  by the account holder  so it was debiting the payments from her account. 
The first was for a payment of £2,000  and the second was for a payment of £1,750.  Mrs T 
complained to WorldPay about the three chargebacks in June 2018. It re-sent  her its 
November 2017  final response about the payment of £950  and sent her a final response  
about the other two chargebacks.
Mrs T wasnt satisfied  with its responses  so complained  to this service in October 2018 
about the three chargebacks,  the service that shes received from WorldPay and the early 
cancellation fee that shes been charged.
The investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mrs Ts complaint about the chargeback for £950  wasn't something that this service can 
consider because Mrs T had complained to this service more  than six months  after 
WorldPays final response to her. And she said that shed  not been  able to see that 
WorldPay had acted  incorrectly when  applying the other two chargebacks and she was 
satisfied that it had sent a response to Mrs T regarding the chargebacks. And she thought  
that WorldPay had acted fairly and in line with how shed expect it to when applying the 
cancellation fee.
Mrs T has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that:
WorldPay's June 2018  final response  refers to its November 2017  response as its 
"initial response" and she contested immediately the initial response (which was sent 
after the second and third chargeback letters had been received) but didnt address 
the entirety of her complaint;
the complaint  consists of all three chargebacks and her letters complaining about the 
chargebacks were all sent within 17 days of each  other  but WorldPay didnt 
respond to the subsequent complaints;
the chargeback  letters  asked for signatures from the cardholder which couldnt be 
provided as the transactions were  "cardholder not present"  which  WorldPay was 
aware of;
she offered to send  to WorldPay  the signed  proof of postage  from the recipients of 
each of the tracked item deliveries;
WorldPay says that "where  possible,  we will try to defend you against chargebacks 
by emailing you to request more information about the chargeback"   but she 
received no such e-mails and has been sent arrears letters and received  phone calls 
Ref: DRN29928872threatening her with credit agencies and bailiffs, even after it was sent the reference 
number for her complaint to this service; and
she doesnt feel that it can be right that that shes  in this position despite  WorldPay's  
failure to act on the information at its fingertips which would have prevented  these 
fraudulent transactions.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
WorldPay made a chargeback in October  2017  for a payment of £950  that had been  made  
to Mrs Ts business in September 2017. Mrs T complained to WorldPay  and it responded in 
November 2017.  Its response said that Mrs T might be able to complain to this service but 
that she must do so within six months  of the date of its letter.  But Mrs T didnt complain to 
this service until October 2018. She says that the delay  was caused because  of the difficult 
personal circumstances that she was experiencing. But Im not persuaded that those  
circumstances are enough to amount to exceptional  circumstances.  So I find that Mrs T 
didnt complain to this service about the first chargeback until more than six months after the 
date of WorldPays final response to her  and that the delay wasnt  caused  by exceptional 
circumstances. Although WorldPay has since referred to its November 2017 response as its 
initial response  I consider that it was a final response about  the first chargeback. So I find 
that this service is unable  to consider  Mrs Ts complaint about the chargeback  for £950.
WorldPay made two further  chargebacks for payments that had been made to Mrs Ts 
business in September 2017   the first in October  2017 for £2,000  and the second in 
November 2017  for £1,750. Mrs T complained to WorldPay about those chargebacks  and 
she contacted  WorldPay at least four times  about  the chargebacks between October 2017 
and June 2018. But WorldPay didnt respond to her complaint about the two further 
chargebacks until June 2018.
I consider that WorldPays terms and conditions  that had been accepted by Mrs T  allow  it 
to make chargebacks  for payments that havent  been authorised  by the account  holder. 
WorldPay sent chargeback letters to Mrs T which said that a chargeback was being  made  
for each  of the two payments. And the chargeback letters said that WorldPay would 
endeavour to pursue this matter on Mrs Ts behalf  if documentation signed by the cardholder 
was provided within  15 days. But the payments had been made when  the cardholder  wasnt 
present so Mrs T didnt  have any documents that had been signed  by the cardholder. And I 
dont consider that the tracked delivery receipts  were enough to show that the cardholder 
had authorised the payments  or that WorldPay should re-credit  the chargebacks to Mrs Ts 
business account.
Mrs T says that shed contacted WorldPay about the payments and been told that the 
payments were authorised. The payments had been authorised   but not by the cardholder   
and when the cardholder said that they hadnt authorised the payments, I consider that 
WorldPay was entitled to make a chargeback.  
Mrs T closed  her business account with WorldPay and it charged her a cancellation fee. 
WorldPays terms and conditions set out how the cancellation fee will be calculated. And Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has charged  the cancellation fee 
incorrectly.
Ref: DRN29928873Mrs T says that WorldPay has continued  to contact her about the arrears on her account 
even after shed referred her complaint to this service.  Theres no requirement for a business  
to suspend recovery action whilst  a complaint  is being considered by this service   and Im 
not persuaded that WorldPay was required to suspend its action to recover the arrears on 
Mrs Ts business  account from her. Nor am I persuaded that theres  enough evidence to 
show that its recovery actions in these circumstances have been unfair or unreasonable.  
I sympathise with Mrs T for the effect  that the chargebacks are having on her business  but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show that WorldPay wasnt entitled to 
make the chargebacks or that it has acted incorrectly in making the chargebacks in these 
circumstances. 
So I find that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require WorldPay  to re-credit the 
chargebacks to Mrs Ts business account  or to waive all (or any part) of the cancellation fee 
 or to take any other  action  in response  to her complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 June 2019
