DRN-2166437
The complaint
Mr D says Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream (Lending Stream), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr D says he doesnt consider that he is good with money and that Lending Stream 
didnt carry out sufficient checks before it lent to him. He says the borrowing has had a 
detrimental effect on his financial position and also his mental health.

The second of our adjudicators partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought loans four to 
eight and loans 14 and 15 onwards shouldnt have been given. They thought Mr Ds 
borrowing behaviour suggested he was having problems managing his money and the 
repayments were becoming unsustainable for him. 
Lending Stream disagreed but did offer to uphold loans four to eight. We put the offer to     
Mr D, but he didnt wish to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure     
Mr D could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr D didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three and loans nine to 
13 shouldnt be upheld. And Lending Stream has already made an offer for loans four to 
eight. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr D had with Lending Stream. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took  loans 14 and 15  chain two. Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. After doing so Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
I should first say that I agree that there are two chains in lending. There was a break of 12 
months between loan eight being repaid and loan nine being taken. Because of this I dont 
think its unreasonable for Lending Stream to have assumed that Mr T had overcome 
whatever the financial circumstances were that caused him to take high-cost credit in the 
first instance. A break in a chain of lending, in effect, starts the clock ticking again on what 
we would consider to be proportionate checks a business should carry out when taking into 
account the length of the borrowing relationship with a consumer.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr D, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
14. I say this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr D was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr D had taken out six loans (in chain two) within 11 months. 
So Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr D was 
having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ds first loan was for £300 (in chain two) and loan 14 was for the same amount 
having borrowed both higher and lower amounts in between time. At this point 
Lending Stream ought to have known that Mr D was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Again, a pattern was emerging  similar to chain one  where Mr D would take more 
loans where he still had previous loans running thereby increasing his monthly 
repayment and the amount of overall debt he had with Lending Stream. When Mr D 
applied for loan 14, he had only repaid loans 11 to 13 in the previous few days (he 
had previously done the same where he paid off loans one to six all on the same 
day). This behaviour does suggest Mr D was struggling to manage his finances and 
was juggling his money.  
Mr D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. Loan 
14 was taken out 13 months after Mr Ds first (in chain two). Mr D had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr D lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing for loans 
14 and 15 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Mr D borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 14 and 15 and Lending Stream should put 
things right.
Putting things right
For completeness, I am including loans four to eight  for which Lending Stream has already 
made an offer  in this section.
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans four to eight and 14 and 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about four and five from Mr Ds credit file;
the number of loans taken from six to eight and loans 14 and 15 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to eight 
and loans 14 and 15 should be removed from Mr Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
