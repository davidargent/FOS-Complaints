The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) blocked and closed his 
account and recalled a Bounce Back Loan (BBL) he had been granted.
Mr H ran a sole trader business, so the account and complaint is in his personal name.
What happened
On 15 July 2020, NatWest granted a BBL to Mr H in the sum of £38,500. On 17 August 
2020, NatWest blocked Mr Hs account while it carried out a review. The next day, NatWest 
issued Mr H with 14 days notice to close his account. Later, NatWest served Mr H with a 
notice of default and recalled the BBL.
NatWest didnt reply to Mr Hs complaint, so he contacted our service to look into things. 
However, our investigator didnt uphold his complaint. She couldnt disclose the reasons 
NatWest made its decision, but she was satisfied it was entitled to do so, having reviewed 
the information both parties had provided. 
Mr H didnt agree. He said he had paid deposits to suppliers for purchases he couldnt 
complete, because of NatWests actions. He asked for an ombudsman to review the matter 
afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Mr Hs primary concern is being declined access to the BBL funds. But I 
think its helpful to first set out my findings on NatWests actions leading up to the recall.
Account block
All banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. That sometimes means they need to restrict customers 
accounts while they carry out a review. So, in order to make an award in favour of Mr H, I 
would need to be satisfied that NatWest acted unfairly or took actions it wasnt entitled to 
take. 
Having looked at the evidence, Im satisfied NatWest acted in line with its legal and 
regulatory obligations when it blocked Mr Hs account. And that it was entitled to do so under 
the account terms and conditions that governed the relationship between NatWest and Mr H. 
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account with a customer, so long as it does so in a way that 
complies with the terms and conditions of the customers account. The terms and conditions 
of Mr Hs account  which both NatWest and Mr H had to comply with  say that NatWest 
could close the account by giving Mr H 60 days notice, or immediately in certain 
circumstances. 
Having considered the evidence NatWest has provided to explain why it closed Mr Hs 
account, Im satisfied it acted in accordance with its terms and conditions when it did so. 
Based on the evidence Ive seen, NatWest was entitled to terminate its relationship with Mr 
H immediately, so I dont think it treated him unfairly by giving him 14 days notice. 
Bounce Back Loan 
I recognise NatWests decision to withdraw the BBL will have caused Mr H inconvenience 
and Ive listened to what hes said about the impact on his business. But, in order to make an 
award in Mr Hs favour, Id need to be persuaded that such impact was the result of NatWest 
doing something wrong, or treating Mr H unfairly.
NatWest issued a formal letter of demand on 10 November 2020, in which it said an event of 
default had occurred which had led NatWest to demand immediate repayment of the loan. It 
explained payment of £38,500 was due and it then used the money in Mr Hs account to 
settle the debt. 
I understand Mr H doesnt believe NatWest was entitled to recall the loan, but having 
reviewed the evidence both parties have submitted, Im satisfied that it was. The terms and 
conditions of the BBL set out the circumstances in which NatWest can demand repayment of 
the loan, as well as the circumstances in which it can offset funds maintained in a current 
account against the outstanding balance. And Im satisfied NatWest followed the correct 
procedure and acted in accordance with the terms of the BBL. 
I understand Mr H might want to know the reasons behind NatWests decision. But the terms 
of the BBL dont oblige it to divulge that information. And, having thought about everything 
both parties have told me, I see no basis on which I could reasonably compel NatWest to 
undo its actions, or compensate Mr H for any losses he suffered.
I recognise this was not the outcome Mr H was hoping for, and that he feels strongly about 
his complaint. And while I cant divulge any more information, I hope he will take some 
comfort from the fact that an independent third-party has reviewed NatWests actions.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
