K820x#14complaint
Mr H (who is a sole trader of Business  A) has complained about the service National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has provided.
background 
On 26 March 2019 Mr H cashed a cheque  (via a cash deposit  machine)  for £1,250  into his 
business account he held with NatWest.  But the following day the funds were debited  from 
the account. Originally NatWest said that the funds had been reversed because the cheque  
issuer had insufficient funds. But after further investigation NatWest confirmed that it had 
misplaced the cheque.  Because  of this Mr H had concerns about fraud.
Mr H is also unhappy with the service NatWest  provided. He says he was passed to several 
departments and the NatWest staff members were  rude to him when he tried to get an 
update.
NatWest has said that the service  it provided  wasnt of a satisfactory  level and apologised for 
the upset it had caused. In acknowledgment of this, on 1 April 2019 it offered Mr H £250 for 
the trouble and upset and  £37.80 for the seven hours of calls Mr H had made.  It also 
credited the cheque to the account  with £1,250.
Mr H remained  unhappy so he brought the complaint to our service.  Our investigator looked 
into the complaint  but he didnt recommend that it be upheld. In summary he said that while  
he could appreciate why Mr H was concerned about the misplaced cheque,  NatWest  had 
assured us that if the cheque was found it would be destroyed and there  was no evidence  to 
suggest fraudulent  activity  had taken place. And as Mr H had been  credited with the value of 
the cheque on 1 April 2019, NatWest had operated  within its normal  cheque  clearing 
timescales. Overall our investigator was satisfied with the compensation NatWest had 
provided and explained  it was in line with what we would have requested it to have offered.
Mr H still remained  unhappy because he says he spent seven hours trying to sort the matter  
out. And because of this he wants £1,500 compensation. So the case  has been  passed to 
me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I wont be upholding the 
complaint. And I will explain why.
Mr H deposited the cheque (via a cash deposit machine) on 26 March 2019. And while I 
appreciate the funds  didnt credit the account  straight away  (because the cheque was 
misplaced) NatWest did credit the account with the value of the cheque  on 1 April 2019. This 
was within  five working days,  which  I dont think is unreasonable and its in line with the 
usual cheque clearing  timescale. So with that in mind I dont think its reasonable to say that 
Mr H experienced a longer delay than could  be expected. 
I understand that Mr H is unhappy that he was passed to different departments when he was 
trying to resolve the issue and he had to make  several phone  calls. I can appreciate  this 
would have been frustrating and have  caused him a degree of distress. But NatWest  has 
admitted that the service it provided was unsatisfactory and apologised for this. It has also 
Ref: DRN62586702offered £250 for the distress and inconvenience it caused and reimbursed Mr H £37.80 for 
the calls he had to make. Having considered the amount of time Mr H was without the funds 
and the time it took NatWest to resolve the matter, I think  the amount NatWest  has offered is 
fair and reasonable and in line with what our service would have recommended.  With this in 
mind I wont be asking  NatWest to do anything further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H on behalf  of 
Business A to accept or reject my decision before 18 August  2019.
