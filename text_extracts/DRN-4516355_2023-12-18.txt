The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked and closed his bank 
account. He says this caused his him a lot of financial problems and upset. He wants 
NatWest to pay him compensation and provide an explanation for its actions.
What happened
The detailed background of this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here.
Mr A was a long standing customer of NatWest. He had a current account which he has 
explained had a number of direct debit payments set up on it to pay his bills, mortgage, and 
loan repayments. 
In July 2022, NatWest blocked and reviewed Mr As account. This meant Mr A wasnt able to  
access the money in his account and some direct debits werent paid. The account was 
blocked between 11 and 18 July 2022. Following this, in August 2022, NatWest decided to 
close Mr As account and wrote to him giving him 60 days notice to make alternative 
banking arrangements. The account was closed in October 2022.
As a result of the block Mr A missed three direct debit payments, including a loan repayment 
and his regular payment to a utility company. Mr A made several phone calls and sent 
emails to NatWest whilst the account was blocked seeking an explanation for the banks 
actions. He said NatWest wouldnt provide him with much information and didnt call him 
back when promised. Mr A has explained that because of NatWests actions he suffered 
sleepless nights and became depressed over the situation. He strongly believes that 
NatWest should have warned him that it was restricting his account. He said he had never 
missed a payment in over 35 years and NatWests actions has impacted his credit file 
negatively. Hes also upset that NatWest stopped him using the account switching service to 
set up another account with a different bank.
In response to Mr As complaint NatWest said it was complying with its legal and regulatory 
obligations when it had blocked Mr As account. And that it  had closed the account in line 
with the terms and conditions. It acknowledged that at times it didnt provide the best service 
in response to Mr As calls and apologised. NatWest also refunded charges associated with 
Mr As missed direct debit payments.
Unhappy with this response, Mr A brought his complaint to our service where an investigator 
considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about why it had 
blocked and then closed Mr As account. NatWest gave us some information but said it 
couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to us. But overall, the bank said 
it was complying with its legal obligations and hadnt done anything wrong in doing what it 
did.
The investigator said that based on the limited information the bank had provided, he 
couldnt say the bank had treated Mr A fairly when it had blocked and closed his account. 
So, he said that NatWest should pay Mr A Â£150 compensation for the trouble and upset this 
had caused him. Mr A disagreed and said that the amount of compensation offered doesnt 
adequately reflect the amount of trouble and upset he suffered. He also wants NatWest to 
explain why it did what it did.
In response to the investigators view NatWest provided more information about the reasons 
it blocked and closed Mr As account. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter came to me to decide.
After reviewing all the evidence, I came to a different conclusion to the investigator and 
issued a provisional decision which said the following:
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mr A, but Id like to reassure him that I have 
considered everything.
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect 
persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Theyre also required 
to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means 
they need to restrict customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out their 
review. The terms of the account also permit NatWest to block an account. This means 
NatWest is entitled to block and review an account at any time.
I understand that Mr A wants NatWest to explain the reason it blocked his account. I can 
appreciate that he would have been frustrated and upset that when he spoke to NatWest, he 
wasnt able to find out much at all about why the bank had decided to block his account. But 
NatWest is under no obligation to tell Mr A the reasons behind the account block, as much 
as hed like to know. Its also under no obligation to warn Mr A that it was restricting his 
account before placing a block on the account. So, I cant say its done anything wrong or 
treated Mr A unfairly by not giving him this information or warning as he would have liked. 
I can see that the block on his account meant three direct debits werent paid. I appreciate 
because of this Mr A is worried about his credit file and is concerned that it will be harder for 
him to apply for a mortgage in the future, Whilst I accept what Mr A says and understand his 
concerns, I havent seen any evidence that NatWest blocking his account led to Mr As credit 
file being damaged. Ive not seen anything to show that he couldnt apply for another 
account. In fact, I note that Mr A was able to open another account quite quicky with another 
bank. If Mr As credit file was impacted by NatWests actions, I would have expected Mr A 
may have had trouble doing this  but thats not the case.  I note too that as a gesture of 
goodwill NatWest has refunded the charges associated with the unpaid direct debits, which I 
think is fair and reasonable.
Having looked at all the evidence, including the information NatWest has now provided this 
service, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances for NatWest to block Mr As  
account. NatWest has explained that this was its standard procedure, and I accept that it 
was. Im also satisfied that in doing so NatWest were complying with its legal and regulatory 
obligations. So, whilst I accept, the banks actions caused Mr A inconvenience and upset 
when it blocked his account, I cant say the bank did anything wrong and treated him unfairly 
in doing so. Banks are also entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as this is 
done fairly, doesnt breach law or regulations and is in keeping with the terms and 
conditions. And unless theres a good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a 
bank must keep a customer. But they shouldnt decline to continue to provide an account 
without proper reason, for instance of unfair bias or unlawful discrimination. And they must 
treat new and existing customers fairly. In this instance the terms of Mr As account say that 
in certain instances NatWest can close accounts with immediate notice and by providing 60 
days notice. NatWest wrote to Mr A in August 2022, giving him the full notice period that it 
was closing his account and that hed need to make alternative banking arrangements. 
This can be due to a number of reasons and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the 
customer. Just the same as if Mr A decided to stop banking with NatWest, he wouldnt have 
to explain why. Based on what NatWest has shared with this service, Im satisfied their 
actions were reasonable in the circumstances. And the banks decision to stop providing 
Mr A with banking facilities was reached legitimately and fairly. So, it wouldnt be appropriate 
to award Mr A any compensation since I dont find NatWest acted inappropriately when it 
blocked and closed his account.
Mr A says when NatWest let him know it was closing his account, he tried to transfer his 
NatWest account to another bank using the account switching service, but NatWest stopped 
it. I understand that this would have been inconvenient for Mr A. While I can see that he was 
able to open another account, I appreciate that manually switching over numerous direct 
debits and standing orders would have been time consuming. But from looking at NatWests 
Current Account Switch Guide, it says that the switch service can be stopped or suspended. 
Having looked at all the evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest didnt do anything wrong when 
it stopped Mr As switch process and did so in line with its guidelines. 
Communication
Mr A says he made numerous phone calls to NatWest to try and find out what was 
happening to his account.  He says that when he spoke to advisors, they promised to call 
him back but then didnt, which was frustrating and upsetting. I can see that NatWest wrote 
to Mr A on 26 July 2022, explaining that it had blocked his account in line with the terms and 
conditions. In the letter NatWest accepted that the service it provided to Mr A when he called 
the bank to try and find out what was happening with his account fell short. And that is 
shouldnt have told Mr A that it would call him back. NatWest apologised for this, and I think 
this is a fair and reasonable way to resolve this aspect of Mr As complaint. So, I wont be 
asking the bank to do anything further.
In summary, its clearly caused Mr A trouble and upset when he wasnt able to use his 
account and NatWest closed his account. So, I realise he will be disappointed by my 
decision. But having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, I cant 
say NatWest treated Mr A unfairly when it blocked and closed his account. So, I wont be 
asking NatWest to do anything more to resolve Mr As complaint.
NatWest accepted my provisional decision. Mr A didnt and responded with a number of 
points. In summary he said:
he wants to know why NatWest closed his account and feels NatWest has treated 
him like a criminal
NatWest didnt tell him it had blocked his accounts and his direct debits would be 
impacted
NatWest lied to Mr A when it sent him a letter saying he didnt have enough money in 
his account to meet his direct debit commitments, which wasnt right as he had more than enough money in his account. NatWest then realised their mistake and refunded 
the charges he incurred due to the bounced direct debit payments
It was very stressful to manually set up direct debits after NatWest stopped him using 
the account switching service
His mortgage payment was blocked which caused him a lot of problems with his 
mortgage provider
Now both sides have had an opportunity to comment I can go ahead and issue my final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the provisional decision, Mr A has raised a number of concerns, which Ill now 
address below.
As Ive already set out in my provisional decision NatWest are under no obligation to provide 
Mr A with an explanation for why it blocked and then closed his account. NatWest is also 
under no obligation to give Mr A prior warning that it intended to review his account. Having 
looked at all the evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest has acted in line with the terms and 
conditions and were complying with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked and 
closed Mr As account. So, I cant say it has acted unfairly.
NatWest has acknowledged that the service it provided at times to Mr A fell short  to put 
things right it has refunded the charges Mr A incurred as a result of three missed direct 
debits for sending him a letter saying he didnt have enough money in his account to meet 
his direct debits. And it has apologised for not returning a call. I think this is fair and 
reasonable, so I wont be asking NatWest to do anything more.
In summary, I appreciate that Mr A will be disappointed by my decision, and I accept that 
Mr A was upset and inconvenienced by NatWests actions, but I see no reason to depart 
from my provisional findings. I remain of the view that this complaint should not be upheld for 
the reasons set out in my provisional decision, which are repeated above and form part of 
this decision.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
