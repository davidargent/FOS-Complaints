The complaint
Miss R complains that Herts Insurance Consultants Ltd trading as Sterling Insurance
Services (Sterling) mishandled her motor insurance policy.
Miss R is represented by her parents.
Where I refer to Sterling, I include employees and others insofar as I hold Sterling
responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
In June 2021, Miss R had a provisional driving licence. She was interested in buying a
particular car. She and her parents called Sterling. They got a quote for a learner driver
policy for the car. They also asked for information about what the premium would go up to
when she passed her test. Sterling mentioned a figure of £1,200.00.
Miss R took out a learner driver policy that started on 15 June 2021. It was for a year or until
she passed her test, whichever came sooner. The policy also covered her mother as a
named driver.
On 18 August 2021, Sterling said that, when Miss R passed her test, the premium would go
up to about £2,300.00 because the car was in insurance group 23.
On 21 August 2021, Miss R passed her driving test and cancelled the policy.
Sterling made a refund of about £218.00 for the period between 21 August 2021 and 14
June 2022.
In September 2021, Miss Rs parents complained to Sterling that if it had given them correct
information, they would never have bought the car. They said that, after the cancellation,
they had insured the car in their name until they sold it for less than they had paid for it.
By a final response dated early January 2022, Sterling said that it had made a further refund
of £88.22 commission.
Miss R brought her complaint to us without delay.
In its submission to us, Sterling offered to make a further refund of its administration fee.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that Sterlings offer was fair. She didnt think that Sterling had
made an error or should have provided information on how the insurers rate their policies.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss R   
and to Sterling on 12 May 2022. I summarise my findings:
Sterlings submission to us offered to refund the admin fee. Sterling had recently 
confirmed that this is a further £50.00. Deducting that refund, Miss R wouldve paid 
Sterling £206.44.
Id accepted that Sterling would charge Miss R the following:
time on cover (approx.) £ 80.00
extras £ 88.00
cancellation fee £ 40.00
total (approx.) £208.00
That figure of approximately £208.00 is broadly in line with the figure of £206.44.
I expected Sterling to provide a detailed statement of account.
Subject to any further information from Miss R or from Sterling, my provisional decision was 
to direct that Sterling should make the further refund of £50.00, but not to direct Sterling to 
do any more in response to this complaint.
Miss R has acknowledged receipt of the provisional decision.
Sterling accepted the provisional decision.
So I see no reason to change my view. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to decide whats fair and reasonable. In making that decision, I have to take into
account the relevant law, regulation and good practice.
Miss R has quoted from the Insurance Act 2015, Part 2 Section 3 and Part 5 Section 17. In
my view, that doesnt help her because:
Part 2 doesnt apply to consumer insurance contracts.
Section 17 has a narrow definition of disadvantageous term. That is specific to
terms contracting out of terms that dont apply to consumer insurance contracts or
contracting out of the implied term to pay a claim within a reasonable time.
Miss R entered into a consumer insurance contract.
Miss R has no complaint about a term relating to payment of a claim.
Sterling is not an insurer.
Sterling was acting as an intermediary between Miss R and an insurer. Sterling was
responsible for setting its own fees, but the insurer, rather than Sterling, was responsible for
setting the insurance premium.Miss R is complaining about the information Sterling gave rather than about the level of the
premium after she passed her test.
Ive noted that Miss R was enquiring about a small car with a small engine. And it had been
made in about 2006. Its value was about £2,600.00. But it was a convertible.
From the June 2021 call recordings, Im satisfied that Sterling made clear from the outset
that it wouldnt be possible to get a quote for Miss R with a full licence until nearer to the date
of her test. But Sterling gave a ballpark figure of £1,200.00 or more.
I dont consider that Sterling was under a duty to warn Miss R that the car was in a high
insurance group. That was merely one factor that wouldve been reflected in the quote it
gave her for the learner policy.
So I dont consider that Sterling unfairly caused Miss R to buy a car that she wouldnt
otherwise have bought. And I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Sterling to
compensate Miss R for the net loss she and her parents have suffered after buying, insuring,
taxing, advertising and selling the car.
I dont consider that any of Sterlings refunds or offers amounted to an admission of liability.
I note that Sterling initially charged the following:
Motor insurance £425.32
Extra cover:
Personal accident £ 17.00
Keys £ 19.00
Excess £ 52.00
Subtotal of extras £ 88.00
Admin fee £ 50.00
Total £563.32
Ive noted that Sterlings terms of business provided for a cancellation fee of £40.00.
Miss Rs mother has said that after the cancellation, Sterling persuaded the insurer not to
charge a short-term rate for the short time on cover  so it made a pro-rata refund. She has
said that was about £346.00.
To put it the other way round, the motor insurers charge for time on cover was about
£80.00. I havent seen Sterlings confirmation of that, but it looks about right to me.
I wouldnt expect Sterling to have made a refund of the extra cover for accident, keys or
excess protection, totalling £88.00.
And I would expect Sterling to charge a cancellation fee of £40.00.
Sterling refunded Miss R £218.66. Deducting that refund from the total of £563.32, Miss R 
had paid Sterling £344.66.
Sterling later refunded a further £88.22. Deducting that refund, Miss R had paid Sterling
£256.44.Sterlings submission to us offered to refund the admin fee. Sterling has confirmed that this 
is a further £50.00. Deducting that refund, Miss R wouldve paid Sterling £206.44.
Ive accepted that Sterling would charge Miss R the following:
time on cover (approx.) £ 80.00
extras £ 88.00
cancellation fee £ 40.00
total (approx.) £208.00
That figure of approximately £208.00 is broadly in line with the figure of £206.44.
Sterling still hasnt provided a detailed statement of account.
Putting things right
I find it fair and reasonable to direct that Sterling should make the further refund of £50.00, 
but not to direct Sterling to do any more in response to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I direct Herts Insurance Consultants
Ltd trading as Sterling Insurance Services to make the further refund of £50.00 to Miss R. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 July 2022.
