The complaint
Mr R complains HSBC Bank UK Plc caused him to lose access to his mobile banking 
application. 
What happened
Mr R has accounts with HSBC. He uses its mobile banking application. In September 2019 
he found he couldnt access it. He contacted HSBC to ask it fix the problem. It was a couple 
of days until he could use the application. Mr Rs not happy about that and how HSBC dealt 
with the issue. After he complained HSBC offered him £75 compensation to recognise how 
hed been inconvenienced. Our Investigator said HSBCs offer of compensation was enough. 
Mr R didnt accept that. He wants more compensation. So the complaint has come to me for 
a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its unfortunate Mr R couldnt access the application for a short while. When he contacted 
HSBC it tried to sort the problem out. It seems it might have mistakenly deactivated his 
registration when doing so. This may have increased the length of time he was unable to use 
the application. But overall I feel it responded to the issue reasonably. Ultimately Mr R was 
only unable to use the service for a couple of days. I cant see it caused him to lose out 
financially. The disruption to the service and calling HSBC about it may have been 
inconvenient. But its offer of £75 is enough to recognise that.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im not making HSBC UK Bank Plc pay Mr R any extra 
compensation or do anything differently. Its offered him £75. Thats fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances so my final decision is that HSBC Bank UK Plc should pay Mr R £75 if it 
hasnt already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2020.
