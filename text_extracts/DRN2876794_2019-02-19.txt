Ms L complains that PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender) lent her money that she 
couldnt afford to repay.

When Ms L complained  to Mr Lender  that the loans werent affordable  it didnt agree. It says 
it was entitled  to rely on the information  she gave, and when it did so it saw that the loans  
were affordable for her. 
I issued a provisional decision in this complaint on 11 January 2019  not upholding Ms Ls 
complaint. Within the decision I made  the following findings:
The adjudicator  recommended that Ms Ls complaint be upheld  in part. She said     
Mr Lender should have carried out further checks for loans 1-4 but because Ms L has 
been unable  to provide bank statements for this period of time, she is unable to say 
whether the loans  were affordable for her. The adjudicator went on to conclude that 
Mr Lender had carried out proportionate checks for loans 5-7. 
Our adjudicator also concluded that Mr Lender  shouldnt have agreed to roll over 
loan 1 for a fourth and fifth time.  So she partially  upheld Ms Ls complaint and asked 
Mr Lender to put things right with regards to the last two roll overs  for loan 1.
But I was minded to reach a different outcome to that of our adjudicator. I drew the 
same conclusions  in that I also thought Mr Lender should have carried  out further 
checks for loans 1-4 but was unable to say whether the loans were affordable. I also 
said Mr Lender had carried out proportionate  checks for loans 5-7. But I concluded 
that although Mr Lender  was not wrong in agreeing to roll over Ms Ls repayment of 
loan 1 on a number of occasions,  it should have carried out further checks after the 
fourth time to see if she could afford  to do so. But I was unable to say whether, at this 
stage, Ms L would have been able to afford the roll overs as she was unable  to 
provide any bank statements from this time.
I then concluded  for the reasons already given that I was minded not to uphold       
Ms Ls complaint. Mr Lender had offered to pay compensation for loan 7 and I said it 
was up to Mr Lender to decide  whether  to honour this.
Both parties  have confirmed they have received my provisional decision. 
Ref: DRN28767942my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Mr Lender has not responded to my provisional  decision  and has not provided any further 
comments.
Ms L confirmed that she had received  the provisional decision and asked if I had upheld or 
not upheld her complaint. She also said she had repaid loan 7 and asked what  the offer from 
Mr Lender was. 
I have read through Ms Ls reply and have considered what she has said. Ms L was unsure 
whether I upheld her complaint or not. I have  not upheld Ms Ls complaint. This is because  
although I did not think Mr Lender  carried out proportionate checks  for loans 1-4, I have 
been unable  to say whether further checks would have  shown  them to be unaffordable. I 
also concluded that Mr Lender carried out proportionate checks  for loans 5-7.
Ms L also said she had repaid loan 7 and asked what Mr Lending was offering regarding  
this. Mr Lender has made an offer to compensate Ms L with regards to loan 7. But it is up to            
Mr Lender to decide whether or not to honour what it has put forward.
In conclusion, I do not uphold Ms Ls complaint for the reasons given in my provisional 
decision.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2019.
