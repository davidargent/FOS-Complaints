K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr A has been represented  by a claims management company (CMC)  when making his 
complaint. But for ease  I will generally  refer to all communication as having  been from, and 
with, Mr A directly.
Mr A was given 51 loans by Sunny between June  2017 and November 2018.  All of the loans 
were due to be repaid  in instalments but generally  Mr A repaid  the loans far earlier than had 
been agreed. All of the loans have been fully repaid and a summary of Mr As borrowing 
from Sunny  is shown as an appendix  to this decision.
Mr As complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators.  She didnt have enough 
information to conclude that there had been  anything wrong with Sunnys decision to give 
the first six loans to Mr A. But she didnt think the remaining loans should have been agreed. 
So she asked Sunny to pay some  compensation to Mr A.
Sunny agreed  with our adjudicators recommendation  and offered  the required 
compensation to Mr A. But disappointingly Mr A didnt respond to the offer that Sunny had 
made. So, as the complaint hasnt been  resolved informally, it has been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage  of our process. If Mr A accepts my decision it is 
legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN15607222the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
The repayments on Mr As first five loans  were relatively modest compared to the income 
that he declared to Sunny. I think Sunny should  have  been increasingly concerned about 
Mr As finances when he continued  to ask for new loans  before repaying his previous 
borrowing. But even so the combined repayments he needed  to make on the first four loans 
still appeared to be easily  affordable. So given Mr As combined repayment  amounts, what 
was apparent about his circumstances at the time,  and his history with the lender,  I dont  
think it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask him for the amount of information  that 
would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr A provided or the information Sunny 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think Sunny  was wrong to give these four loans to Mr A.
I think that by the time Mr A asked  for his fifth loan  his fifth request in a month - Sunny 
should have realised that it couldnt safely rely on the information he was providing about  his 
finances. I think it should have taken steps  at that time to independently verify Mr As true 
financial position. We asked Mr A for copies of his bank statements so we could see what 
better checks would  have shown Sunny. He didnt  provide these to us. So Im not able to say 
that better  checks would  have shown Sunny that it shouldnt have given loans 5 or 6 to Mr A.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr A I think  by loan 7 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide any further loans. 
Ref: DRN15607223I say this because:
This was now Mr As seventh loan request in less than two months. Each of the loans  
Mr A had taken had been repayable in instalments. But Mr A regularly paid those 
loans off far earlier than planned,  and borrowed again very shortly afterwards. I think 
that pattern  of frequent  borrowing and repaying early should have indicated  to Sunny 
that Mr A was most  likely having  significant problems managing  his money.  
Mr A would regularly have several loans open  at the same  time. On many  occasions 
he had four loans  open, and at one stage he had five.  He wasnt making  any inroads 
to the amount he owed the lender. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr A was provided  with a new loan typically  within a very short 
time of taking a previous one. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr A was having to borrow further  to cover the hole making repayments on 
his previous loans  was leaving in his finances and that Mr As indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr A complained to Sunny in October 2017 and said that he was facing financial 
hardship. In its response to Mr As complaint Sunny said that it didnt think  it 
appropriate to advance him any further credit. But Mr A was given 36 new loans after 
hed made his complaint, and 32 of those  loans were after Sunny  had said it wasnt  
appropriate to lend to him again.
I think that Mr A lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr As 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr A from loan 7 onwards. Sunny needs to 
pay Mr A some  compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr A after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 4 August 2017 (loan  7). So for each of those  loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr A on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 onwards should be removed from Mr As 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN15607224my final decision
My final decision is that I largely uphold  Mr As complaint and direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 September  2019.
