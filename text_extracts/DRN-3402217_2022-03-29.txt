The complaint
Mr V complains that Everyday Lending Limited (trading as Everyday Loans) was
irresponsible to lend to him.
What happened
Mr V had four loans from Everyday Loans between May 2014 and October 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
Joint 2 May 2014 £3,000 13m £402.80 1 Jun 201525 Feb 2015
With loan 1
1 25 Feb 2015 £6,000 24m £365.66 1 Mar 201730 Mar 2016
With loan 2
2 30 Mar 2016 £10,000 36m £612.74 1 Apr 201931 Oct 2018
Refinanced
3 31 Oct 2018 £6,390.25 60m £337.94 1 Nov 2023 Outstanding
Mr V says that Everyday Loans did not carry out sufficient affordability checks before 
agreeing to the loans. He says had it done so, it would have seen he was already 
dependent on high cost lending and further repayments were unsustainable. Mr V adds that 
the loans worsened an already poor financial situation.
Everyday Loans says it verified Mr Vs job and income, reviewed bank statements, obtained 
payslips and conducted credit searches. It adds that it used a statistical average to estimate 
his other living expenses and the checks showed the loan was affordable. It says it believes 
its checks were proportionate and the repayments were sustainable over the loans terms.
Our investigator explained that the first loan would be considered separately as it was in joint
names but she recommended the complaint about the other loans should be upheld. She
found that the information collected by Everyday Loans showed that Mr V was already
struggling to manage his money at the time of loans 1, 2 and 3. She recommended that any
payments made by Mr V should be deducted from the principal and that any overpayments
should be refunded with 8% interest. She also said that any adverse information should be
removed from Mr Vs credit file.
Everyday Loans responded to say, in summary, that it did not accept the investigators
assessment of loan 1. It said it used a year-to-date figure for Mr Vs income and even if
Mr Vs actual credit card payments were used, the loan would still be affordable. Everyday
Loans accepted the investigators view of loans 2 and 3.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr V and to Everyday Loans on 25 February 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings:
As the investigator explained, Mr V took out the first loan jointly with another party, so 
it will be considered as a separate complaint.
Everyday Loans agreed to the investigators finding about loans 2 and 3, so I didnt 
consider those loans further.
I was satisfied Everyday Loans carried out proportionate checks for loan 1 as it 
verified his income, checked his credit file and obtained bank statements;
I found the affordability calculation used reasonable income and expenditure figures 
and that Mr V had enough disposable income to sustainably make the repayments.
My provisional decision was that I found Everyday Loans made a fair lending decision for 
loan 1, but that Mr Vs complaint about loans 2 and 3 should be upheld, as it had agreed.
Mr V said he accepted my provisional decision, but Everyday Loans did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional information and Mr V accepted my provisional 
decision, I see no reason to depart from it.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Everyday Lending Limited (trading as 
Everyday Loans) should:
Add up the total money Mr V received as a result of having been given loans 2 and 
3. The repayments Mr V made should be deducted from this amount.
 If this results in Mr V having paid more than he received, then any 
overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated 
from the date the overpayments were made until the date of settlement). *
 If any capital balance remains outstanding, then Everyday Loans should 
attempt to arrange an affordable and suitable payment plan with Mr V;
Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Vs credit file regarding loans 2 
and 3 up until the settlement date.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Everyday Loans to deduct tax from interest. Everyday 
Loans should give Mr V a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
