The complaint
Mr A complains that U K Insurance Limited mishandled a claim on his commercial vehicle 
insurance policy.
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman deals with a consumer complaint against one insurance 
company or other regulated financial firm at a time. Where it is a complaint about a claim on 
an insurance policy, we treat it as a complaint against the insurance company that was 
responsible for dealing with that claim.
Mr A had a vehicle that was over 10 years old. For the year from June 2018, Mr A had an 
insurance policy that covered the vehicle. 
UKI was responsible for dealing with claims. Where I refer to UKI, I include engineers, 
claims-handlers and others insofar as I hold UKI responsible for their actions.
The vehicle had already suffered some other damage before it suffered damage to the 
offside on 8 March 2019.  
The policy insured the vehicle up to its market value before that earlier damage. The claim 
was subject to a £100.00 excess.
In September 2019, UKI estimated the cost of repairs as £1,429.72. In lieu of that, UKI sent 
Mr A £1,300.00.
In October 2019, Mr A asked UKI about wheel alignment and wheel repairs. He said he had 
made an online purchase of a wheel for £35.92.
In November 2019, UKI said that the vehicle wouldve been valued at £2,915.00 but for the 
earlier damage for which it deducted £1,315.00. So it valued the vehicle at £1,600.00 before 
the accident on 8 March 2019.
In early December 2019, Mr A told UKI hed incurred £75.00 for wheel alignment and 
£500.00 for a new wheel.
Mr A complained to UKI that the pre-accident value of his vehicle had been £2,495.00. 
UKI increased its deduction for earlier damage from £1,315.00 to £1,723.12. UKI wrote a 
final response dated 18 December 2019. Unhappy with that, Mr A brought his complaint to 
us in March 2020. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. The investigator 
thought that UKIs cash-in-lieu payment had been fairly offered. UKI had said it was willing to 
cover the £75.00 wheel alignment and £35.92 wheel because these amounts didnt go 
beyond UKIs valuation of the vehicle. 
Mr A disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
The valuation that he provided previously of £2,495.00 was accurate.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy limited UKIs liability to the pre-accident value of the vehicle. Ive considered 
whether UKI applied a fair process to reach a fair valuation.
Ive noted what Mr A has said about the price of a replacement vehicle. But vehicles dont 
always sell for as much as advertised prices. I place more weight on the trade guides. 
Ive noted the make, model, age and mileage Mr As vehicle. For a vehicle like his, the trade 
guides give figures from £1,575.00 to £2,910. 00. That is for a vehicle without accident 
damage. UKI took a slightly higher figure as its starting point. I think that was in an effort to 
assist Mr A. I find that £2,242.00 wouldve been fair for a vehicle in average condition.
But Mr As vehicle had suffered previous damage.
At the end of October 2019, UKIs engineer said the following:
The vehicle had covered 97828 miles with old damage to:
  Front Grille and surround.
  Vandal scratches to osf door, osr door osr  panel
  Osr  dented
  Rear bumper scraped
  3 alloy wheels heavily kerbed
  Nsr wheelarch dented and corroded
  Nsr door dented
  Nsf door scratched
  Nsf wing scratched
Mr A has provided some photographs of the nearside of his car. Some of those show 
damage to the front wing, rear door and rear wheel arch. So I dont consider that he has 
provided enough evidence to contradict UKIs evidence that the pre-accident damage was in 
the region of £1,723.12.
I recognise that owners and purchasers of older vehicles may choose not to pay for minor 
bodywork repairs. So I dont consider that the estimated cost of repairs leads to a pound- for- 
pound reduction in the value of an older vehicle. 
But even if I were to take the figure of £2,242.00 and to deduct only half of UKIs estimate of 
£1,723.12, it wouldnt lead me to find that UKI reached its pre-accident figure of £1,600.00 
unfairly. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI to increase its valuation or its offer 
to Mr A.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct U K Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2021.
