K820x#14complaint
S, a community owned business, complains that National Westminster  Bank  Plc failed to 
make a CHAPS payment on 22 November 2018.  S says that as a result  of this delay, it was 
charged £500 by its contractors. It wants NatWest to pay that back. 
Mr D and Mr W have  brought this complaint on behalf of S. 
background
Mr D and Mr W complain that NatWest  made  a mistake with a CHAPS payment, causing  a 
day of delay, which they say cost S £500. 
NatWest says S first tried to make  the payment by cheque, but a signature didnt match. So 
S then asked for the payment to be made by CHAPS transfer instead. NatWest  accepts  it 
made a mistake with the payment. Its refunded the CHAPS fee, and offered a compensatory 
payment of £100.  It says that S can still accept that offer if it wants to, but NatWest  wont pay 
S the £500  it says it has lost. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. She said that NatWests terms and conditions  
say that it wont pay for losses incurred  as a consequence of mistakes like this. And she said 
that NatWest also didnt know that S was going  to be charged  in this way. Even  S didnt 
seem to know that in advance. So she didnt think it was fair to ask NatWest to pay S back  
the £500 it said it had been  charged. 
Mr W, on behalf of S, wrote to disagree.  He accepted  that NatWest  was strictly within  its 
rights to refuse to reimburse S, but he thought it should do so. NatWest had admitted it had 
made a mistake,  and it should make  sure that its customers  didnt lose out because of that, 
and particularly in this case,  given  the special status  of S. 
Mr W said that S didnt know that the contractor was planning to charge for late payment, 
because S had always paid on time. He said the contractor probably  did not decide  to 
charge us £500 until 22nd or 23rd November.
Mr W thought  that S had arranged this payment in good time. He also said that there was no 
reason for the earlier payment not to have been attempted by cheque,  as S didnt know  the 
consequences of a late payment then. 
Mr W wanted Ss complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman,  so it was passed  to me for 
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
on this complaint as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
Our investigator has stressed  that NatWest  has no obligation  to reimburse S for the £500 it 
paid, because NatWests  terms  and conditions say that it doesnt pay for losses  like this. Ive 
seen the relevant terms, and I think thats right. 
Ref: DRN05018162But I also have to consider whether its fair and reasonable  for NatWest to refuse to pay the 
£500 that S says it has lost. 
I know NatWest  made a mistake. Its refunded the CHAPS payment fee it had charged S, 
and its offered S £100 to apologise for that. Im sorry  to have to tell S that I dont think it has 
to do more than that. Ill explain why I think that.
S said it didnt have advance warning of this charge for late payment. So NatWest didnt 
know that either. And thats a key part of this complaint,  for me; that NatWest had no idea 
that any mistake in its payment would have these  consequences. Because NatWest has 
explicitly stated in its terms that it wont cover losses like this, and because  it didnt know that 
such a loss was possible, I dont think it would  be fair and reasonable to ask NatWest  to 
cover the full amount of the payment to the contractors that S has made. 
NatWest has offered S £100  in compensation.  Its told us that this offer is still open  to S, if it 
would like to accept. Although I appreciate that S wont agree with me on this, I do think that 
provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.  So Ill leave it to S to decide if it 
wants to accept that offer. 
I know that S will be disappointed, but I dont think that this complaint should  be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D and Mr W, on 
behalf of S, to accept or reject my decision before 30 October 2019.
