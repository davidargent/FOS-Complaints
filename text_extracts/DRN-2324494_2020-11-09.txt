The complaint
Ms M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) failed to stop her monthly 
direct debit payment and this created financial problems for her.
What happened
Ms M has a credit card account with NewDay and telephoned them to ask them to postpone 
her August 2019 monthly payment as she lost her job and needed time until her new job 
started. 
Ms M says that NewDay failed to carry out her instructions, so she contacted her bank to 
organise a recall of the direct debit. In error, her bank recalled the previous six months direct 
debits rather than the August 2019 payment and this put her into arrears with NewDay. Ms 
M says she spotted the mistake and asked her bank  to return these payments to NewDay, 
although this was carried out by her bank, NewDay didnt apply the refund correctly which 
resulted in Ms Ms credit card account going into default. Her account was then sold to a 
debt collection agency and her credit file was marked to reflect this. Both her bank and 
NewDay have admitted making errors and have subsequently amended her credit file and 
paid, or in NewDays case offered, compensation to her. Ms M feels NewDays offer of 
compensation doesnt adequately cover her expenses or the inconvenience and stress 
caused to her. Ms M has a medical condition which she says has been made worse as a 
result of the stress caused to her. 
NewDay says they have apologised to Ms M and while they cant see any evidence she 
asked them to stop the August 2019 payment, they do accept they made mistakes in failing 
to correctly apply the refunded amount from her bank and didnt return emails. NewDay says 
they took the account back from the debt collection agency and amended Ms Ms credit file 
accordingly. NewDay says they have made an offer of compensation of £225 to her and they 
feel this is reasonable in the circumstances, given she is now back to the position she was 
before the errors were made. 
Ms M wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the information available and while he felt NewDay had put 
matters right, the level of compensation offered should be increased to £400 given the 
distress and upset caused to Mrs M, given her medical condition.
NewDay wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to 
an investigator for a final decision.
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said:
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can see that it would have been frustrating and stressful for Ms M to see that as a result of 
the mistakes made by both her bank and NewDay her credit card account was put into 
default and her credit rating affected as a result. 
When considering this complaint, I have looked at whether NewDay acted reasonably 
following the mistakes they accept they made, and if the amount offered by way of 
compensation fairly reflects the inconvenience and upset caused here.
What happened here was Ms M asked NewDay if her next direct debit payment due could 
be cancelled as she was between jobs and couldnt afford the payment. Ms M says NewDay 
agreed to this but failed to stop the direct debit payment. As a result, Ms M arranged for a 
direct debit indemnity claim from her bank  unfortunately her bank claimed 6 months 
payments, and this resulted into putting her credit card account with NewDay into arrears. 
Ms Ms bank then corrected their mistake and recredited her credit card account, however, 
NewDay failed to mark these payments correctly and bring the account out of arrears which 
resulted in the credit card account being sold to a debt collection agency. 
During this time Ms M says she made various phone calls that werent returned adding to a 
stressful situation and NewDay were unhelpful during this time. 
NewDay says they have no record of Ms M contacting them to cancel the initial direct debit 
but only for the following month when they learnt of her financial difficulty. I have considered 
this point, but phone records provided by Ms M show a call was made to NewDay at the time 
she says, so on balance I am satisfied the call was likely to have been made.  
NewDay have accepted they didnt provide the level of service they would expect and have 
offered Ms M a payment of £225 for the trouble and upset caused to her. I can see that 
NewDay did take her credit card account back from the debt collection agency and corrected 
her credit file, which is what I would have expected to see. This means that Ms M was put 
back into the position she would have been in before the mistakes occurred. 
Ms M says her own bank repaid the borrowing on her NewDay credit card account for their 
involvement and errors contributing to this episode. I understand the circumstances here 
would no doubt have contributed to Ms Ms stress at this time, but equally I can only 
consider NewDays actions here as part of this complaint and I think the amount of £225 
offered by them is fair to compensate her for the impact its actions wouldve had.
Its not my role to penalise banks as that is for a regulator to consider, but to ensure 
mistakes, when  made, are corrected and a fair compensation is awarded to reflect this  I 
am satisfied this is what happened here. 
While Ms M will be disappointed with my decision. It follows I wont be asking anymore of 
NewDay. Ms M should contact NewDay if she wishes to accept their offer of compensation. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 I gave both Ms M and NewDay until 2 December 2020 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. NewDay have accepted my provisional decision and while Ms M wasnt happy with 
my provisional decision, nothing she has said, gives me reason to change or add to this and 
so my final decision remains the same. NewDay have asked Ms M to provide her bank details should she wish to accept their offer 
of compensation.
My final decision
My final l decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2020.
