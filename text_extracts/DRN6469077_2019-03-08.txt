Miss C complains Morses Club PLC was irresponsible when lending her money and that 
correct affordability and credit checks were  not carried out. 
background 
Between June  2013 and December 2014  Miss C took out six loans ranging from £300 to 
£600 with Shopacheck Financial Services (SFS). SFS merged with Morses  Club in March 
2015. By October  2015  Miss C had started to struggle to make the payments to loan six. 
In 2018 Miss C complained to Morses Club that the loans had been unaffordable and mis-
sold to her. Morses Club did not agree. It said it had done proper affordability checks  and 
concluded that Miss Cs disposable income, based on information provided by Miss C, was 
sufficient to afford the repayments. Miss C didnt agree and brought  her complaint to this 
service. 
Initially our adjudicator concluded  that loans one to four had been agreed following 
reasonable checks and were  therefore affordable. But she felt that SFS should have done 
more to ensure  that loans five and six were affordable, and concluded  they werent. 
Morses Club disagreed with this view and argued  it had undertaken checks that were 
proportionate to the amounts borrowed.  And it said it was entitled to rely on the accuracy of 
the information provided by Miss C. Our adjudicator agreed and amended her view.  
Miss C wasnt  happy and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman. She said Morses 
Club should have  known at the time that she was on a debt management plan, as it wouldve 
been recorded on her credit  file. 
After considering all of the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mis 
C and Morses Club on 23 January 2019. I said: 
Ive outlined the progression of the loans in the table below:
Loan Principal Charge Date sold Date settled Weekly  Repayments
1 £400 £300 11/6/13 11/3/14 £14.00
2 £300 £225 18/12/13 12/8/14 £10.50
3 £400 £300 11/3/14 18/12/14 £14.00
4 £400 £300 21/5/14 17/3/15 £14.00
5 £600 £450 8/8/14 18/6/15 £21.00
6 £500 £375 18/12/1431/8/16 
(debt sold)£17.50
By loan four a pattern of increased  borrowing is evident. There is six months between  loans  
one and two. And then three months between loans two and three  and two months  between  
loans three  and four. The level of repayments  jumped at loan three and then jumped again 
at loan five. However,  we know that Miss Cs disposable income  increased  at the time of her 
application for loan four, as can be seen  in this second table.

Morses Club has said that SFS carried out appropriate and proportionate checks. With the 
value of the loans, its possible that a credit check in June 2013 would have been 
proportionately satisfactory for the business to proceed with the first loan.  Morses  has said it 
did carry out a credit  check for this loan. Although it hasnt been  able to provide evidence of 
this check, I think its very likely that it took place. 
Miss C has said she was on a debt management  plan and this wouldve been  evident on her 
credit file. I agree that evidence of debt would be on a credit  file, but the actual debt 
management plan would  not have  been  on it. 
Having agreed  loan one Miss C made  regular payments  against  the loan and her positive  
account behaviour  would have contributed  to the successful application of the next loans. 
Loans five and six were  higher than the previous loans.  And with a static and then 
decreasing disposable income and an increase in debt I believe that in August 2014 SFS 
should have carried  out further checks on affordability.  Although  I accept that the total value 
of repayments  for all the loans fell within the range  of Miss Cs declared  disposable income.
Morses Club has said Miss C hadnt told SFS about the debt management  plan; that the 
amounts borrowed  were modest; that her payment  history indicated she could  afford the 
loans; and that it was entitled to rely on the income  and expenditure information Miss C 
provided at the time. It also said that there  was no requirement to look at Miss Cs bank 
statements. 
I dont disagree with the points raised by Morses Club in general.  Miss C had a responsibility 
to provide an honest account of her financial history.  But the checks  that may have been  
proportionate for loan one would be different by loan five on the basis  that:
loans three and four were still outstanding
loans five and six were both for higher amounts than loans  one to four
Miss Cs disposable  income  was static for loan five, and was lower by loan six
Had it done a new credit check at any point after loan two it wouldve seen that Miss C was 
in arrears with a payday loan in August 2013  and had defaulted on it by February  2014.  
Which Im satisfied wouldve been  a red flag for further checks,  including  possibly viewing 
Miss Cs bank statements. Ive examined  these  myself, and I can see Miss C was already on 
a debt management plan from the start of her first loan. 
Ref: DRN64690773Miss C did meet her repayments until October  2015 during loan six. But this doesnt 
necessarily mean she was on top of things and I was satisfied that, subject to any further  
evidence or information I might receive from either party, loans five and six were  
unaffordable.
Both Miss C and Morses  Club agreed  with my provisional findings. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional decision was sent to Miss C and Morses Club and both parties accepted  it. 
So I see no reason  to depart from its conclusions. 
my final decision
My final decision is to instruct  Morses  Club PLC to:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss C paid on loans five and six;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement;
The total refund should be paid towards the outstanding capital balance; 
oIf the refund clears  the outstanding capital balance, the remaining funds 
should be paid directly to Miss C;
oIf the refund doesnt clear the outstanding  balance, Morses Club and Miss C 
should agree  on an affordable repayment plan; and
Remove any negative  information about loan five and six from Miss Cs credit file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 April 2019.
