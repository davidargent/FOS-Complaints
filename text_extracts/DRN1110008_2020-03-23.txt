K821x#15complaint
Mr S has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  Elevate  
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr S says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Mr S took out 9 instalment loans from Sunny between  May 2016 and 
March 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ss borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
Most recently, one of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it 
should be upheld  from the point of loan 4 onwards. Sunny doesnt agree with this although  
its made an alternative offer to settle the complaint, which  wasnt accepted by Mr S. The 
complaint has therefore come to me for an ombudsmans final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ss 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr S could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN11100082whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr S could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr S. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ive taken note of Mr Ss declared income and also what he said about his monthly 
expenditure. With all this information, and bearing in mind  what Ive said above about  the 
length of the lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out 
appear to have been proportionate for loans 1  3. And I think  these levels of checks, 
together with the income and expenditure details provided by Mr S himself,  would have 
made those  particular loans appear  affordable for him from Sunnys viewpoint. 
However, I think from the point of loan 4 onwards in this case  things would have  looked  
different and therefore required  a more thorough and responsible approach. For loan 4, for 
example, we can see that previous Sunny lending hed taken out was still outstanding at the 
time. But its also clear that given  all the financial details Mr S had provided to Sunny, he 
couldnt credibly afford to make all the loan 4 payments without  undue  hardship. As our 
adjudicator said,  his incoming salary  barely  left him with any money once  his declared 
outgoings were  taken into account.
However, theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the point of loan 4 to look more 
thoroughly at Mr Ss financial situation. I think if it had done  this, it would have shown he was 
having trouble  managing money  and was probably borrowing to meet  normal ongoing  
commitments and those of other loans. All this would  have  been  obvious, with more  
thorough checks,  which would  also have  shown Mr S was using other short-term lenders. So 
I think it was irresponsible  to lend to Mr S at the point of loan 4. For loan 5, it can be seen  
that the situation was only exacerbated because he was lent more  money,  again  with other 
Sunny debts still outstanding and he was also indebted to other  lenders. I therefore  think  
loans 4 and 5 shouldnt have been provided.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  6 directly followed the paying down of a 
previous loan and Mr S had been lent to regularly over 18 months. So there  was an obvious  
dependency on high-interest, short-term lending evidenced by this. Im therefore  also 
upholding Mr Ss complaint in respect of loans  6 - 9. Sunny repeatedly  lent to Mr S in an 
unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN11100083the length of time over which Mr S borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 4 - 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ss credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 9 should be completely removed 
from Mr Ss credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr S a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr S as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.
