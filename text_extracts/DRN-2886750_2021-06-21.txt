DRN-2886750
Contrary to what it says in the box above (which our software wont let me edit), I will refer to 
It's A Wrap Branding Ltd as X.
The complaint
Mrs G complains on behalf of X, a limited company, that WorldPay (UK) Limited falsely 
assured X that it would be protected against all fraudulent card transactions, and is seeking 
the repayment of money from X after failing to defend a chargeback claim.
What happened
One of Xs directors has authorised Mrs G to represent the company in this complaint.
X used to accept card payments using a card terminal provided by WorldPay. Mrs G says 
that in a phone call, WorldPay had guaranteed that X would be protected from all fraudulent 
transactions. She says X relied on this assurance when entering its new contract with 
WorldPay. She says this turned out not to be true, and she referred in particular to one 
transaction for a four-figure sum in September 2019 which was charged back eight days 
later. WorldPay returned the money to Xs account while it disputed the chargeback, but its 
appeal was not upheld, and WorldPay attempted to re-debit the money from the account. 
WorldPay still seeks the return of the money from X.
Mrs G would like WorldPay to waive this debt. She says that the card had been stolen, and 
that the genuine cardholder had reported the theft to the police. She argues that WorldPay 
should therefore not have authorised the transaction in the first place.
WorldPay says that card payments are not a guaranteed form of payment, since they can 
always be the subject of a chargeback claim. All card payments are accepted at a businesss 
own risk. The specific payment described above had been authorised when it was made, 
which meant that the card issuer had not yet cancelled the card. WorldPay said this meant 
that it had had no way of knowing that the card was stolen until it was too late.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. She said that WorldPays written terms and 
conditions stated that all card payments are potentially subject to chargebacks. WorldPay 
had attempted to defend the chargeback, and had not done anything wrong. The card issuer 
had authorised the payment, and had not yet cancelled the card at the time the payment was 
made, so there had been no way for WorldPay to know it was a stolen card at the time. She 
also pointed out that the payment had been made without the cardholder being present, and 
that X would have been better protected if payment had been made by chip and PIN instead.
Mrs G did not accept that opinion. She argued that if it was nobodys fault but the fraudsters, 
then it was not fair that WorldPay was still insisting that X should return the money. She 
asked for an ombudsman to review this case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I was sorry to read about the unfortunate circumstances of this complaint. There is no 
dispute that X has been the victim of fraud. That is not Xs fault, but nor is it WorldPays. It 
follows that I cannot uphold this complaint and tell WorldPay to waive the debt. I will explain 
why.
There is no direct evidence of what WorldPay told X in the phone call before the new 
contract was entered. While I cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that it claimed that all 
card payments would be guaranteed, I do not think that is likely, because WorldPays written 
terms make it clear that there is no such guarantee. Indeed, no such guarantee could ever 
be delivered, by WorldPay or by anyone else. Every card payment carries some risk of 
chargeback. Even if the member of Xs staff who was on that phone call was left with the 
contrary impression, I have no way of ascertaining whether that was because of something 
misleading that WorldPay said, or because Xs employee mistook WorldPays meaning. So 
I cannot be satisfied that WorldPay misled X either intentionally or carelessly.
I dont know when the genuine cardholder discovered that the card had been stolen, or when 
they told the police or their card issuer. Even if the theft was reported to the police before X 
accepted the thiefs payment, I dont know what the police did with that information, or if they 
told the card issuer, or when. But Im afraid it is beyond doubt that the card issuer had not 
cancelled the card by the time the payment was made, since if the card had been cancelled 
then it would have been impossible to authorise the payment. In other words, the fact that 
the payment was authorised is proof that the card issuer had not yet cancelled the card, and 
until that happened, WorldPay had no way of knowing that the card was stolen. It follows 
that WorldPay had no reason to stop the payment going through.
Once the chargeback was raised, WorldPay tried to defend the claim, and meanwhile it 
recredited Xs account with the disputed funds. But since the chargeback reason was that 
the card had been stolen and the cardholder had not authorised the payment (the payment 
having been made by someone with no authority to do so), WorldPay had no way of 
succeeding. Once the chargeback dispute was closed in the cardholders favour, WorldPay 
had no choice but to return the money to the cardholder. Under the chargeback rules, that 
meant that WorldPay was entitled to re-debit the money from Xs account.
I appreciate Mrs Gs argument that what happened was not Xs fault. Shes not wrong about 
that. But as matters currently stand, WorldPay has incurred the financial loss, even though 
what happened was not its fault either. The cardholder has got their money back  from 
WorldPay  and X currently still has the money it was paid in September 2019. Under the 
chargeback rules, and under the terms and conditions of WorldPays contract with X, 
WorldPay is entitled to demand that X return the money. I have no grounds on which to 
decide otherwise.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G, on behalf 
of X, to accept or reject my decision before 19 July 2021.
