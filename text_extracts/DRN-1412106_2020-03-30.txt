The complaint
Miss Ks complaint is about the information recorded about her.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
NatWest noted two large payments had been made into Miss Ks account which it 
says were fraudulent. Miss K says she doesnt know where they came from. NatWest 
decided to end its banking relationship with Miss K as it was entitled to do under the 
accounts terms and conditions.
Miss K is unhappy that NatWest also recorded a CIFAS fraud marker against her. 
But I think on balance that NatWest investigated matters appropriately and satisfied 
itself that it had sufficient  evidence to meet the necessary burden of proof to justify 
recording the CIFAS fraud marker against Miss K. 
NatWest has corrected one wrong item of information on the CIFAS marker. Thats 
fair. 
Overall, although I recognise Miss Ks frustration and strength of feeling, I dont think 
NatWest has done anything wrong. It appears to have acted reasonably by recording 
the CIFAS marker. And I dont think I can fairly ask it to remove the CIFAS marker 
or do anything differently as Miss K would like. 
 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank 
PLC. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2020.
