The complaint
X complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt pay his claim.
What happened
X bought a mobile phone for £298 from an online retailer in January 2021. It was advertised 
as new. He raised a claim for a partial refund of £75 from PayPal on 18 January 2021  he 
claimed the phone wasnt new. PayPal asked for more information on 27 January 2021. 
PayPal closed the claim on 3 February 2021. They said they didnt receive the information 
requested from X. PayPal paid a goodwill payment of £75.
X complained. He said hed given the evidence to PayPal to support his claim that the phone 
wasnt new. He said he considered that a new phone should have a security seal on the box 
 and this one didnt. The difference between the cost of a genuine new phone, and the one 
he received was around £100. He opened a claim for £75. It wasnt realistic to return the 
phone in return for this amount. He said that PayPal were bound by the Consumer Rights 
Act and hadnt acted in line with their obligations under it.
PayPal said the claim hadnt been agreed as X didnt provide evidence that the phone wasnt 
as described, or that it had been returned. They asked for this information to be sent to them 
within three days of their request for it - on 27 January 2021. But  X didnt send it to them. 
So, they closed the case in favour of the seller on 3 February 2021. They acted in line with 
their User Agreement. They offered and paid £75 by way of a goodwill payment.
X brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said PayPal had made a payment of £75  
even though theyd denied Xs claim and ruled in favour of the seller. He didnt consider the 
Consumer Rights Act applied to PayPal  as they were a payment processor, not the seller 
of the phone.
X asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate that X feels aggrieved. He thought he was buying a mobile phone that was 
new and paid what he thought was the right price for the new phone in question. But when 
he received it, there wasnt a security seal on the box  so he said it couldnt have been new. 
So, he thought hed paid about £100 too much for it. He showed us screenshots of other 
phones of the same description which did appear to have seals on them. At the time, he 
thought the price difference between a new phone and a second hand one was about £75 
 so thats the amount he claimed from PayPal under its User Agreement  he said it was 
significantly not as described under PayPals definition.
Ive looked at PayPals User Agreement. This says that in considering disputes of this 
nature, their decision is final. It says: PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your 
claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's original determination is considered 
final. It also says that buyers must provide evidence to support a claim, and on time, as it 
says that customers must: Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other 
information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for 
reimbursement. PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police 
reports or other documents that PayPal specifies. You must respond to these requests in a 
timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
I can see that X sent a narrative to PayPal on 18 January 2021 saying The item is listed as 
new. The box did not have a security seal on it and box had signs of being opened. But then 
- I can see that PayPal asked him for information to support his claim on 27 January 2021. 
They asked for it within three days. The request said Please provide any information we ask 
you to send us within 3 days. If we dont hear back from you within this timeframe, we may 
decide this case in the sellers favourplease. clearly explain how your item 
significantly differs from the item advertised. But Ive also seen that X didnt sent it to them 
within the timescale  by 31 January 2021. And the case was closed in favour of the seller. 
At that time, PayPal said the decision was made because the dispute was submitted with 
insufficient information/documentationwe were unable to obtain the required 
information/documentation after requesting it from you. So  PayPal declined the claim on 
that basis. They did say that he could return the phone to the seller  but clearly, that wasnt 
going to be acceptable to X as he wouldve only received £75 and would have paid out £298 
and wouldnt have the phone either. 
So  as X didnt send in the information in time, I cant say that PayPal were wrong to 
dismiss his claim. But they did make a goodwill payment of £75 to him  so to a large extent, 
X hasnt suffered financially from what happened.
X has argued that he believes that because PayPal have provided a buyer protection 
service, they are subject to the Consumer Rights Act. I dont consider that this is the case. 
As I see it, this Act applies to retailers of goods  and PayPal are a payment provider, not 
the seller of the mobile phone. Also  this service exists to resolve disputes between 
customers and businesses in a practical and common-sense way  and thats how Ive 
reviewed Xs complaint. Its not for us to consider which laws and regulations that PayPal are 
subject to  thats a matter for their regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
I can see that X feels strongly about what happened and so will be disappointed by my 
decision. But Im not going to ask PayPal to do anymore here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2021.
