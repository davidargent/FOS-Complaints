MoneyBoat considered the complaint and concluded it had made a reasonable decision to
provide these loans. Unhappy with this response, Mr S referred his complaint to the
Financial Ombudsman.
The complaint was considered by an adjudicator, who didnt uphold it. She said MoneyBoat
had reasonable grounds to believe Mr S could afford the loans and that it had carried out
proportionate checks. And there wasnt anything in the information MoneyBoat gathered to
suggest that Mr S was gambling.
Mr S didnt agree saying he had been sent emails (and a copy of one was provided) by
MoneyBoat asking to view bank statements before it would release any further funds. Bank
statements werent provided by him yet a loan was still issued  loan three. Mr S reiterated
that had bank statements been seen by MoneyBoat it wouldnt have lent to him due to his
gambling.
The adjudicator made some further enquires with MoneyBoat about its request for bank
statements. After a response was received, the adjudicator wrote to Mr S to explain the
request for bank statements was due to him asking for a loan of £1,100. However, Mr S had
also made an application for £400 (loan three) and MoneyBoat had contacted him to find out
which loan he wanted to continue with. As loan three was requested MoneyBoat didnt
believe it need to see his bank statements.
As no agreement could be reached the case was passed for a decision. I then proceeded to 
issue a provisional decision explaining the reasons why I was intending to uphold Mr Ss 
complaint in part.
Both parties were asked to provide any further submissions as soon as possible, but in any 
event, no later than 20 September 2023. 
MoneyBoat acknowledged the provisional decision and it explained it accepted the findings 
and Mr S hasnt responded.  
A copy of the provisional findings follows this in smaller font and forms part of this final 
decision.
What I said in my provisional decision:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
MoneyBoat had to assess the lending to check if Mr S could afford to pay back the amounts
hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate
to the circumstances. MoneyBoats checks could have taken into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mr Ss
income and expenditure.
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest MoneyBoat should have
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr S. These factors include:
Mr S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mr S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr S. The adjudicator didnt consider it
reached the point in the lending relationship where this applied and as there were three
loans granted in a little over five months I also agree with the adjudicator.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay the loans  not
just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough
money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr S was able to repay
his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised,
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
Before each loan was approved, MoneyBoat asked Mr S for details of his income, which he
declared as marginally increasing with each loan  from £1,800 for loan one to £2,045 by
loan three. MoneyBoat says the income figures were checked through a third-party report
but a copy of this report hasnt been provided.
Mr S also declared monthly outgoings of £750 for loan one and then £550 for loans two and
three. As part of the application, MoneyBoat used information from its credit searches (which
Ill come onto discuss below) and from the Common Finance Statement to adjust the
declared expenditure Mr S had provided. As a result, of this check, Mr Ss monthlyexpenditure was increased by £100 per month for loan one and £300 per month for loans
two and three.
Mr S didnt declare any rent or mortgage costs, which may have alerted MoneyBoat that
Mr S may have had undeclared expenditure. However, MoneyBoat says that Mr S  as part
of his applications explained he lived at home with parents. Which would explain why the
minimum housing costs. It was also reasonable for MoneyBoat to have relied on what Mr S
had declared.
For Mr Ss complaint this means that for each loan, MoneyBoat considered Mr Ss
outgoings, amounted to £850 per month and it was this figure which was used for the
affordability assessment and after carrying out these checks, MoneyBoat was satisfied
Mr S could afford the loans.
Before each loan was approved MoneyBoat also carried out a credit search and it has
provided the results it received from the credit reference agency. It is worth saying here that
although MoneyBoat carried out credit searches, there isnt a regulatory requirement to do
one, let alone one to a specific standard. But what MoneyBoat couldnt do is carry out a
credit search and then not react to the information it received  if necessary.
Ive reviewed the credit check results, and when loans one and two were approved the
results are much the same. MoneyBoat knew that Mr S had five current accounts and at
least four credit cards but these were within the credit limits and there was no sign that Mr S
had recently had repayment problems.
Having thought about loans one and two, taking into account what MoneyBoat was told by
Mr S and what it discovered in the credit checks, I am intending to not uphold Mr Ss
complaint about them as a proportionate check was carried out which showed MoneyBoat
that these loans were affordable.
Loan 3 credit checks
But the credit check results for loan three were significantly different. In addition to the credit
cards and the current accounts there were now a number of active loans (in addition to the
MoneyBoat loans that had been recorded on the credit report).
Mr S had one active home credit loan and four other loans termed as Finance House. On
balance those Finance House loans were likely to be either payday loans or instalment loans
given the term and monthly repayment amount. The total cost to service these loans was
£909  which isnt far short of 50% of Mr Ss declared income. And of course, on top of this
Mr S also had credit cards that needed repaying, so his commitments wouldve been higher
still  and he still had the declared living costs.
MoneyBoat also knew that as part of his application Mr S declared that his outgoings- for
credit commitments was zero. This clearly couldnt have been accurate and MoneyBoat was
given information to suggest these costs were significantly more.
Knowing this, as well as the rapid increase in borrowing (both from MoneyBoat and other
lenders) which the credit check showed, than I do think MoneyBoat ought to not have lent
given the number of outstanding high-cost credit loans as well as the amount Mr S was
already committed to spending on such loans meant that any further borrowing wasnt likely
to be sustainable for him.
Indeed, although MoneyBoat wouldnt have known this at the time, Mr S has gone on to
have problems repaying the loan. In response to this provisional decision, MoneyBoat
should provide an updated statement of account.
Overall, Im intending to not uphold Mr Ss complaint about loans one and two. However, I
am intending to uphold Mr Ss complaint about loan three and Ive outlined below what
MoneyBoat needs to do in order to put things right for him.Other considerations
Mr S, in response to the adjudicator explained that he had been asked by MoneyBoat to
provide copy bank statements before it would release the funds. This is because, at the time
he had an outstanding loan application for £1,100  however this loan application didnt
proceed and wasnt funded.
Im not intending to review this element of the complaint, because Ive already concluded the
credit checks result MoneyBoat received for loan three ought to have led it to conclude that
Mr S couldnt afford to repay the final loan in a sustainable manner.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party had anything further for my consideration and MoneyBoat was clear that it 
accepted the findings in the provisional decision. I therefore see no reason to depart from 
the findings which I reached in the provisional decision, and I still think MoneyBoat shouldnt 
have granted loan three. 
Im therefore upholding Mr Ss complaint in part and Ive outlined below what MoneyBoat 
needs to do in order to put things right. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress MoneyBoat should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not lent loan three to Mr S, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr S may have simply left matters there, not
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mr S in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mr S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce MoneyBoats liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
MoneyBoat shouldnt have granted loan three.
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt MoneyBoat should buy it back if it is able to do
so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat cant buy the debt back, then MoneyBoat
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.A. MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance of loan 
three, and treat any repayments made by Mr S as though they had been repayments 
of the principal. If this results in Mr S having made overpayments then MoneyBoat 
should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled.
B. However, if there remains an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr S and I would remind MoneyBoat of its 
obligation to treat Mr S fairly and with forbearance.
C. MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ss credit file in 
relation to loan three.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to deduct tax from this interest. MoneyBoat
should give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Mr Ss 
complaint in part.
Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk should put things right for 
Mr S as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2023.
