The complaint
Mrs H has complained that I Go 4 Ltd didnt cancel her motor insurance policy when she 
asked them to.  
What happened
Mrs Hs policy was due to renew on 22 February 2023. She sent an email to I Go 4 on  
4 March 2023 to say she didn't want to renew her policy. However, Mrs H sent this from a 
different email address to the one she had given to I Go 4. It seems I Go 4 emailed Mrs H on 
17 March 2023 to say that it could not trace her policy from the email theyd received on 
4 March 2023. And Mrs H then emailed them from the email address I Go 4 did hold to say 
she had wanted to cancel her policy. In the end the policy was cancelled with effect from 30 
March 2023 and I Go 4 asked Mrs H to provide proof shed arranged alternative cover for 
her car. And they told her what she had to pay. Mrs H complained to I Go 4 about this. And   
I Go 4 issued their final response on 14 June 2023. In this they said theyd reduced the 
amount due by £100 and reminded Mrs H of the need for her to provide proof of alternative 
cover. They made it clear the outstanding amount due of £225.75 would stand until she 
provided this proof.  
Mrs H asked us to consider her complaint about I Go 4. One of our investigators did this and 
said I Go 4 should backdate the cancellation of Miss Hs policy to 4 March 2023 on the basis 
that it should have been clear to I Go 4 at this point that she wanted it cancelled. 
I Go 4 did not agree with our investigators view. They maintained that they had dealt with 
the matter correctly. In that it wouldnt have been right for them to cancel the policy because 
of Mrs Hs email of 4 March 2023, as this wasnt from the email address they held for her. 
The case was passed to me for a final decision. I emailed I Go 4 about it and said I agreed 
with our investigator that Mrs Hs policy should be cancelled with effect from 4 March 2023. 
And that she should only be charged a premium for the cover she had between when her 
policy renewed and 4 March 2023, plus a cancellation fee of £35.
I Go 4 didnt agree with me on the basis it was not appropriate for them to take any action 
regarding the policy as a result of Mrs Hs email of 4 March 2023. I went back to I Go 4 and 
pointed out that it seemed theyd emailed Miss H at the email address theyd held for her in 
response to her email of 4 March on 17 March 2023 to let her know they had no details of 
the policy. I further explained that I thought they should have done this on or soon after        
4 March 2023 and that this would have resulted in Mrs H responding quickly and her policy 
being cancelled from this date. I said in light of this it remained my view that Mrs H should 
only be charged for the cover provided to her by the insurer and a £35 cancellation fee. I 
also sent a copy of the proof of alternative insurance Mrs H had sent to us showing she had 
another policy in place with effect from 26 February 2023. 
I Go 4 responded to say that theyd sent the proof of insurance to the insurer and once they 
got confirmation from them this was acceptable Mrs Hs policy would be marked as not taken 
up and the full balance due would be removed.
I emailed I Go 4 back on 21 September 2023 and said I would wait for confirmation of this. 
And I pointed out I had not received copies of Mrs Hs emails to them of 4, 17 and 18 March 
2023 and I asked them to send these again. I havent heard anything further from I Go 4.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive not had a response from I Go 4 to my email of 21 September 2023 and it is now a 
week on, I consider it appropriate for me to issue my final decision.
It remains my view that I Go 4 should have emailed Mrs H at the email address they held for 
her on or soon after 4 March 2023 in response to her email from her other email address. 
This would have meant shed have realised she needed to respond from the email I Go 4 
held for her and confirm she wanted her policy cancelled. She could then have done this 
more or less straight away and her policy could have been cancelled with effect from            
4 March 2023. I appreciate I Go 4 have said there were no policy details in Mrs Hs email of 
4 March. Ive not seen this email, despite asking for a copy of it and letting I Go 4 know I 
havent received one. However, its clear that I Go 4 were able to work out from this email 
that they needed to email Mrs H on the email address they held for her. The problem is they 
didnt do so until 17 March 2023. 
I appreciate all businesses can have backlogs of emails and sometimes these cause a delay 
in them dealing with emails. And that this was the reason I Go 4 didnt email Mrs H on or 
soon after 4 March 2023. However, I dont think Mrs H should lose out because of I Go 4s 
backlog. And its for this reason I think the cancellation of her policy should be backdated to 
4 March 2023. This remains my view, despite the fact Mrs H has now provided proof of 
alternative cover with effect from 26 February 2023. I say this because it is up to her insurer 
whether they want to provide a refund for the period prior to 4 March, as I do not consider 
the fact the policy continued to this point was due to I Go 4s delay in responding to her 
email of 4 March 2023. 
As I think I GO 4 should have cancelled Mrs Hs policy on 4 March 2023, I also think it is only 
fair for them to charge a cancellation fee of £35, as this date was in what is described as the 
cooling off period. And  according to I Go 4s terms and conditions this is the appropriate 
fee for cancellation in this period.  
Putting things right
For the reasons set out above, I have decided to uphold Mrs Hs complaint and require         
I Go 4 to backdate the cancellation of her policy with them to 4 March 2023 and only charge 
her a £35 cancellation fee. This means they must recalculate the outstanding balance due 
on her policy to reflect a time on cover premium for the period 22 February to 3 March 2023 
inclusive, plus the £35 cancellation fee. 
If I Go 4 liaises with the insurer and they decide to charge Mrs H less than this, that is up to 
them, but this decision does not require them to do so. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Hs complaint about I Go 4 Ltd and order them to do 
what Ive set out above in the Putting things right section. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or reject my decision before 26 October 2023.
