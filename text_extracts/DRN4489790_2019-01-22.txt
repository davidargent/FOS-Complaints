K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited, trading as Cashplus, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 19 December 2018. Ive attached it here and it forms part 
of my final decision. The full background to the complaint is set out in the provisional  
decision, so I wont  reiterate it here. In it, I explained why I thought the complaint should be 
upheld in part and asked  both parties  for their comments.
Both parties  responded.  Mr T initially indicated he would try to get copies of bank statements 
covering the period in which loans  1-14 were approved.  But he later confirmed he was 
unable to obtain these. He didnt  make any further comments.
Cashplus said (in summary):
Mr T met their affordability criteria for each loan and the loans didnt negatively  affect his 
credit score
As it had mentioned before, it carried out rigorous system-based  analysis  to assess  
whether credit  would  be affordable   including  obtaining credit bureau  data
Cashplus also provided a spreadsheet of credit bureau data.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint,  taking into account our general approach 
to complaints about short-term lending, which is set out on our website.
Having thought about everything Cashplus has said and the additional information it 
provided, Ive not been persuaded to depart from my provisional findings. Ill explain why.
I appreciate that Mr T met Cashplus affordability criteria for each  loan. But its important to 
understand that I did not uphold Mr Ts complaint on the basis of the individual  affordability 
of any particular loan.  In fact I found  that I was unable to say whether any of the loans  from 
1-26 were actually unaffordable.  I didnt  have enough information from Mr T to make such  a 
finding for loans  1-14. And the information he provided  for loans 15-26 didnt allow  me to 
conclude that loans 15-26  were actually unaffordable.
The key question I asked  about the loans I had upheld (27-94) was the question   Taking 
into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of lending 
increase Mr Ts indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
My conclusion then included that:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability  
to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans
Ref: DRN44897902What Cashplus says about its affordability  checks  and the credit  bureau data it provided 
hasnt changed  my mind  on the above  points.  Thats  because Im also taking into account 
the overall pattern of lending and how that affected  Mr T. Ill explain further.
Mr T first borrowed from Cashplus  in December 2012, the last loan was taken in May 2015. 
There were no obvious  breaks in the pattern of lending during this period of two years and 
four months.
In highlighting  this particular point, Im mindful that the loans Cashplus was providing were 
designed for short-term  purposes. With that said, I think there  may come  a point at which a 
responsible lender would  (or ought to) realise that a customer  was relying  on short-term 
credit in a way which was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.  In Mr Ts case, I thought that 
this point was reached  by loan 27. I said that this was because the amounts Mr T was 
borrowing were generally increasing, and Cashplus ought to have realised it was likely his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. And also because  this type of continuous 
lending meant  Mr T was indebted  to Cashplus over the long term, paying high rates of 
interest, despite the short-term purpose  of the individual loans.
I still think that by loan 27 Cashplus ought  to have reasonably recognised that there  was a 
pattern of Mr T continually  borrowing because  he wasnt able to free himself from the effects  
of settling the previous loans. And so it shouldve realised that continuing to lend would be 
likely to unfairly perpetuate an unsustainable cycle of debt for Mr T  who,  as I mentioned in 
my provisional decision, appeared  to be reliant on benefits and so was less likely to be able 
to break  out of a persistent, expensive cycle of borrowing.
Ive taken on board what Cashplus  said about its loans not negatively affecting Mr Ts credit 
score. But I dont think this makes  a difference. It may be that Mr Ts score didnt change 
significantly. Mr Ts score is just one factor some  lenders may take into account. I think its 
still likely  that providing so many advances  would have affected his ability  to break  out of the 
cycle of borrowing  and access mainstream credit. I appreciate that other  factors,  including  
information from other lenders, wouldve had an impact too. Im only looking at what 
Cashplus did (or didnt do) in this decision and as Ive set out above,  I dont  think it acted 
fairly in approving so many advances.
Finally, as a matter of housekeeping, the most  recent spreadsheet Cashplus provided states 
that there  were actually  95, rather than 94 loans.  Given  the reasons  Im upholding this 
complaint in part, this doesnt  make any difference to the outcome. But Ive made a small 
amendment to the redress directions to take this into account.
In summary,  given Cashplus obligations  as a responsible lender, the short-term  purpose of the 
credit and taking into account this services approach to complaints about short-term lending,  I 
dont think Cashplus acted fairly when it approved loans 27 to 94. In approving  so many loans, it 
caused him to pay an excessive amount  of interest and charges, bearing in mind  the purpose of 
this type of credit. And it likely impacted his ability to regain access  to mainstream credit.  I think 
Mr T suffered a loss as a result of these failings and so Im upholding  his complaint in part.
what Cashplus needs to do to put things  right
Cashplus should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  27 and onwards;
Ref: DRN44897903pay interest of 8% simple  per year on any refunded interest  and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
entirely remove loans  27 and onwards from Mr Ts credit history  as the number of 
loans taken from 27 onwards means any information recorded about them is adverse
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashplus to take off tax from this interest. Cashplus 
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ts complaint in part. 
Advanced Payment Solutions  Limited  must put things right by taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2019.

complaint
Mr T says Advanced Payment Solutions Limited, trading as Cashplus,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Cashplus approved 94 loans for Mr T between December  2012 and May 2015. A table is attached  as 
an appendix to this decision  to give an overview  of the lending.
An adjudicator has considered the complaint already  and recommended it be upheld in part. She 
didnt think Cashplus did enough to check whether any of the loans were  affordable. She also thought 
the business shouldve  realised the number of loans and overall pattern of lending indicated the loans 
had become unsustainable  for Mr T. She recommended Cashplus should  refund the interest and 
charges on loans 8-94.
Cashplus didnt agree  with the adjudicator. It said (in summary):
Prior to offering loans Cashplus carried out rigorous system-based analysis to assess  whether  
credit would be affordable
Cashplus reviewed the level and source of funds received directly  into the Cashplus account  
prior to making  an offer of credit
A credit  bureau report was obtained every  month which Cashplus  used to assess  the financial 
position of its customer, combined  with the other current  account  behaviour  before any credit 
offer is made. At no time did the bureau indicate the customer could  not afford  the loan
The loans  were always repaid on time, which would not indicate any financial issues
As there  was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ts case. 
Im currently  planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint  in part and have explained  why below.
Cashplus needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr T could repay his loans in 
a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Ts income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their income 
the amount, or amounts, due to be repaid are higher  
Ref: DRN44897905there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing  is long
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Ts complaint. These questions are:
1.Did Cashplus, each  time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr T would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those checks  have shown  
that Mr T would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans  provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ts indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
3.Did Cashplus act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Ts complaint.
Did Cashplus, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Mr T would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks  have shown that Mr T 
would have been able to do so?
Cashplus has described, as Ive summarised above, what it did before lending. But to date,  it hasnt 
provided any further  evidence to support this. I havent seen any evidence of the system-based  
analysis, credit  bureau report checks or other affordability checks  it says it carried out. As a result,  Im 
not able to conclude  proportionate checks were completed by Cashplus for any of the loans it 
advanced for Mr T.
At the same time, I havent seen evidence from Mr T about his income  and expenditure  in the earlier 
stage of the lending. Ive seen copies of bank statements  from April 2013 onwards  but these dont 
cover the period of lending  encompassing loans  1-14. So Im unable to say what  proportionate checks 
would likely have shown during this period. And I cant therefore find that any of the loans were  
actually unaffordable. Im not planning to uphold  the complaint about them.
I do have enough information to look at the affordability of loans  15-26. And I think its still appropriate  
to look at whether these  loans were individually affordable.  Although 26 loans  is a relatively large 
number for one individual to take,  many  of the loans  up to this stage were  quite small (£10-£50)  and 
they were all approved within a period  of just 83 days. I think the small  size of many of the loans, 
combined with the relatively short period of borrowing,  means it wouldve taken Cashplus more time 
to establish any sort of pattern (i.e. of the borrowing cumulatively  increasing) in Mr Ts circumstances.
Ive looked at whether the loans wouldve been affordable on a monthly basis, based on what I think 
Cashplus wouldve thought Mr Ts disposable  income  was, had it carried out proportionate checks. 
Ive taken into account information from Mr Ts bank statements to estimate his disposable  income in 
April, May and June 2013.
From what Ive seen, it appears Mr Ts income  was primarily, if not entirely,  from state benefits.  It 
appears he was in receipt of EESA, DLA and housing  benefit. The total received in April 2013 was 
around £1,400 and the amount in May and June 2013 was about  the same. But the bank statements 
Mr T has provided dont shed much light on what his regular living costs were. This means I cant 
reliably estimate his disposable income  or easily establish whether loans  15-26 were actually  
affordable. The overall amount lent in each month totalled £320-£390. I dont think the amounts 
appear to be obviously unaffordable. And so, based on the limited information I have,  Im not planning 
to uphold the complaint about these  loans  either.
Ref: DRN44897906Although I do have Mr Ts bank statements from July 2013  onwards, I havent recreated individual, 
proportionate affordability checks for loans 27 to 94 because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. 
Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mr Ts indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  
Cashplus should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  
And so Cashplus should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further lending. Given the 
particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 27. I say this 
because:
the amounts Mr T was borrowing were  generally  increasing, and Cashplus ought  to have realised  
it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
this type of continuous  lending meant Mr T wasnt making any real inroads,  over time,  to 
reducing his indebtedness to Cashplus. As soon as he repaid  one loan, Cashplus lent to him 
again. Over time this meant he was in effect  paying large  amounts of interest to service  his debt 
over an extended  period
Because Mr T was borrowing so frequently, Ive stepped back  from the weekly borrowing pattern  and 
looked at how Mr T was borrowing on a monthly basis. When looked at in this way, the extent to 
which lending was on an upwards trajectory becomes quite clear, as Ill explain below.
In April 2013  the amount  Mr T borrowed more than doubled  compared to the previous month, from 
£150 to £370. In June  and July 2013 this increased to £390. In August and September this increased 
again to £460 and £470 and then £560 in November. In January 2014 the total amount Cashplus lent 
was £810. 
The amounts lent generally started reducing  from about May 2014,  although  the lending  wasnt 
always decreasing on a monthly basis. But Cashplus still advanced 18 loans  (77-94) in the final year 
of lending, which is a large number  both in itself as well as in the context of how many loans Cashplus 
had already approved  up to this point. So I dont think the reducing amounts Mr T was borrowing is as 
significant bearing  in mind the overall period of indebtedness. I think  the lending  would still have  
caused Mr T to lose out, as I explain  below.  
I think  that Mr T lost out when Cashplus continued to provide borrowing from loan 27 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging  Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit over an extended period of time
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability  to 
access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans
So Im planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint about loans 27 to 94 because  the overall pattern of 
lending increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise  harmful and he lost 
out as a result.
Did Cashplus act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude Cashplus acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr T in some other way. 
putting things  right  what Cashplus  needs to do
Ref: DRN44897907I plan to say Cashplus should:
refund all interest  and charges Mr T paid on loans  27 to 94;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date they were  
paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
entirely remove  loans 27-94 from Mr Ts credit  history as the number of loans taken from 27 
onwards means any information  recorded  about them is adverse
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires Cashplus to take off tax from this interest. Cashplus must  give 
Mr T a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold this complaint in part and to tell Advanced Payment  Solutions Limited to put things 
right as set out above.
