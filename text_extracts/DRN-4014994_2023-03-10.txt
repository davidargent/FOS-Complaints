The complaint
Mrs V complains about mistakes made by Totemic Limited trading as PayPlan when trying to 
agree partial settlements with her creditors.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Mrs V had a number of debts that were being dealt with by PayPlan. Last year, Mrs V 
contacted PayPlan and explained she had received an inheritance and wanted it to contact 
her creditors in an attempt to negotiate a partial settlement of the outstanding debts. Mrs V 
advised she had a certain amount of money available and wanted to offer 50% of the 
outstanding balances to her creditors.
PayPlan went on to contact the businesses involved, but only one agreed to a 50% 
settlement. One business, H, had four debts in Mrs Vs name. PayPlan offered a partial 
settlement of 50% but H rejected it. Instead, H responded with a counteroffer of around 85% 
of the total outstanding balance across all the accounts. PayPlans agent told H Mrs V was 
willing to accept the counter offers, but she hadnt given her consent. H went on to write to 
Mrs V and advised the counter offers it had made had been accepted by PayPlan.
Mrs V later spoke with PayPlan and complained after discussing her accounts with H. Mrs V 
explained H had advised PayPlans agent had accepted a much higher settlement offer on 
her behalf without her consent. PayPlan contacted H and explained the counter offers had 
been agreed in error. H confirmed the accounts were on hold and that the partial settlement 
offer that had been agreed by PayPlan had been cancelled by Mrs V. But Hs letter 
confirming the counter offer had been accepted by PayPlans agent was still sent to Mrs V.
PayPlan contacted H again and it confirmed the acceptance had been withdrawn and 
accounts all placed on hold for 30 days. 
Mrs V complained to PayPlan and it made arrangements to return funds it held on her 
behalf. Mrs V went on to advise that H had declined to negotiate further with her due to the 
acceptance PayPlan had given on her behalf. PayPlan contacted H again and was advised 
Mrs V had made a further partial settlement offer, this time for 60% of the outstanding 
balance. When PayPlan checked, H advised it another counter offer of around 81% of the 
outstanding balance had been made to Mrs V.
Mrs V subsequently negotiated settlements directly and has cleared the outstanding 
balances. PayPlan sent Mrs V a final response and apologised for the service provided and 
errors made, making her an offer of £75 to apologise for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. An investigator at this service looked at Mrs Vs complaint. They thought PayPlan 
had dealt with Mrs Vs case fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else.
Mrs V asked to appeal and said shed had to take action to put matters right and negotiate 
with H directly which was very time consuming and stressful. Mrs V said that PayPlans error 
meant H was reluctant to consider lower partial settlements and made the situation much 
harder to resolve. Mrs V forwarded copies of her text messages with PayPlan over a period 
of around a month. As Mrs V asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to 
make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been reasonably brief in setting out the background above as all parties broadly agree 
about the overall timeline for Mrs Vs case. PayPlan accepts that it was given a specific 
figure by Mrs V with a view to negotiating partial settlements on her behalf. PayPal also 
accepts its agent acted in error when they accepted Hs counter offers without checking with 
Mrs V first. When PayPlan issued its final response it apologised for the service provided 
and offered Mrs V £75. Whilst Im pleased PayPlan accepted its agent acted in error, Im not 
persuaded the compensation offered fairly reflects what happened or how Mrs V was 
impacted.
Mrs V told our investigator she expected PayPlan to act on her behalf when negotiating 
partial settlements with her creditors. And Mrs V has explained that, as a result of PayPlans 
mistake, she had to negotiate directly. I can see that PayPlan went back to H to confirm its 
agent accepted the counter offer in error. But I can understand why, after making that 
mistake, Mrs V felt unable to trust PayPlan to continue negotiating on her behalf. Mrs Vs 
explained H was less willing to negotiate partial settlements after PayPlan accepted the 
counter offer in error. And whilst I can see H went on to make another slightly lower counter 
offer, I think Mrs V makes a reasonable point when she says PayPlans mistake made it 
harder for her to negotiate further. Im not persuaded that £75 fairly recognises the fallout 
from PayPlans mistake.
In addition, Ive looked at the level and nature of contact between Mrs V and PayPlan. 
Looking at Mrs Vs text messages, it appears that PayPlan couldve taken quicker action at 
times to try and resolve the situation with H. And PayPlans contact notes show there was a 
reasonable level of inconvenience caused to Mrs V following PayPlans actions that took 
several weeks to resolve. Overall, Im not persuaded that £75 if a fair reflection of the level of 
distress and inconvenience caused.
Ive considered how to fairly resolve Mrs Vs complaint. In my view, a payment of £200 more 
fairly recognises the impact of PayPlans mistake and the impact caused to Mrs V. So unless 
new information is provided that changes my mind, I intend to uphold Mrs Vs complaint and 
direct PayPlan to pay her a total of £200 (less any compensation already paid).
In response, PayPlan said H had rejected a 50% settlement by Mrs V had been able to 
negotiate a reduced settlement a little over a week later. PayPlan also said that delays Mrs V 
experienced in the period after it incorrectly made an offer on her behalf were caused by a 
complaint she raised against H concerning the level of settlement it was willing to accept. 
PayPlan asked me to reconsider increasing the level of compensation awarded.
Mrs V responded and confirmed she was willing to proceed on the basis of the provisional 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered PayPlans response to the provisional decision but my view of how to fairly 
resolve Mrs Vs complaint remains unchanged. I still think PayPlans actions caused Mrs V 
an unreasonable level of distress and inconvenience that isnt reflected by a payment of £75. 
Whilst I note PayPlans comments, I remain satisfied that agreeing a settlement outside of 
the amount Mrs V authorise or could afford to pay caused delays and problems for her. Ive 
reviewed the full file again and taken PayPlans comments into account. Having done so, Im 
satisfied that a payment of £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused is fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances. As I havent been persuaded to change my view, Im 
going to proceed in line with my provisional decision and uphold Mrs Vs complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Vs complaint and direct Totemic Limited trading as PayPlan 
to pay her £200 (less any compensation already paid). 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs V to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2023.
