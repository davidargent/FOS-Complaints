Hamsard hasnt provided the dates when loans 32 and 34 were repaid. For loan 32, I know 
there was a balance of £30 as of 30 June 2019. For loan 34 a balance of £14.50 as of 
2 October 2020. I therefore cant be sure whether these loans have been fully repaid. 
Hamsard also only has the point of sale documents (such as the income and expenditure 
information) from loan 10 onwards.
Miss H complained to Hamsard about her lending and received a final response letter. 
Unhappy with the response she referred the case to our service. 
An adjudicator reviewed the case and thought Hamsards checks went far enough for loans 
1 - 5, so she didnt think Hamsard was wrong to have provided them. However, the 
adjudicator thought that Hamsard shouldnt have provided loan 6 (or any later loans) 
because at this point, in her view, the lending had become unsustainable. 
Miss H has accepted our adjudicators findings. 
Hamsard didnt agree, and in response it made a number of points. In summary it said;
at all times Hamsard considered Miss Hs creditworthiness and concluded that she 
was able to make her repayments without undue difficulty 
the FCA is aware how Hamsard takes repeat lending into account as part of its 
creditworthiness assessment
the FCA hasnt raised any concerns about the way Hamsard lends 
all of the available loan agreements that have been provided demonstrate the agent 
undertook creditworthiness assessments
Hamsards information shows Miss H could afford the loans she was committed to 
making
The agent wouldve discussed in detail with Miss H the purpose of each loan in order 
to be satisfied she wasnt using it to cover her living costs
There is nothing concerning in the pattern on Miss Hs borrowing 
No explanation has been provided as to what proportionate checks ought to have 
looked like
Had Hamsard not provided the credit its likely Miss H wouldve gone to other credit 
providers (both regulated and unregulated)
Hamsard abided by the FCA rules and regulations 
Following a recent court case Hamsard says that if redress is due then this service 
needs to consider that Miss H wouldve gone elsewhere for credit, so there should 
either be no redress due or a significant discounted amount should be repaid. 
It also provided a copy of a report titled The impact on business and consumers of a cap on 
the total cost of credit. The report was published in 2013 by the Personal Finance Research 
Centre at the University of Bristol. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time these loans were provided.
Hamsard needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Hamsard should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Miss H. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Hamsard was required to establish 
whether Miss H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint. 
Loans 1-5
The adjudicator didnt uphold these loans, and Miss H has accepted the adjudicators 
outcome. Hamsard also appears to have accepted her findings into these loans. 
So, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about them. But, for the avoidance of 
doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about this 
lending. And as these loans form part of the borrowing relationship Miss H had with Hamsard, they are something I have taken into account when considering the later loans she 
borrowed.
Loans 6 - 38
Hamsards response concerns how this service approaches repeat lending and the rules and 
regulations that were in place at the time and how it has complied with them. We have 
responded to Hamsard on these issues in detail through other final decisions it has received, 
and the published decisions on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at 
length here. 
To begin with, I think it would be useful to deal with the report that Hamsard provided us. 
The report was requested by a government department to look at the impact of introductions 
of variable cost caps in various credit markets, including the home credit market. 
While Ive noted the content of this report, which is not, of course, an expression of the 
regulations that Hamsard was required to comply with, I think the market place and 
regulations have moved on. This report was produced in 2013 and we know the FCA 
introduced a cost cap for high cost short term loans in 2015. So, I wont be looking at or 
considering this report further. 
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe the loans Miss H took as high cost 
as does the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within 
its identified high cost credit portfolio. And while I note it has a longer term than, for 
example, a payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a 
consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a consumer. 
The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered these issues 
alongside everything else in making my decision.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6-38 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
But I will say that Ive not found what Hamsard says about its checks to be persuasive in 
demonstrating the loans were either affordable or sustainable. It looks like, based on what 
Hamsard has been provided, that it took the same sort of information for each loan, that 
being asking Miss H about her income and her expenditure.  
Hamsard also says, that the agent wouldve checked Miss Hs bank statements to verify the 
information that she provided. But, having looked through all the application forms Hamsard 
has provided, it seems the first time this information was even considered was when loans 
23 / 24 were provided (around five years into the lending relationship). And even then, the 
bank statements seem to have been used to verify Miss Hs identity rather than as a way of 
verifying the information she had provided.  
So, Im not clear how Hamsard can say it carried out proportionate checks when, as Ive said 
above, it doesnt appear to have changed the type or level of checks. Despite Miss H 
returning for new loans fairly regularly as well as showing signs of potential financial 
difficulties when it took her longer than intended to repay a number of loans for examples 
loans 20  22. So, the fact Miss H confirmed she could afford the loans doesnt set aside the 
requirement for Hamsard to carry out proportionate checks. 
Although Hamsard says that there is no record of Miss H raising her concerns with its agent 
about financial difficulties. It doesnt mean there werent any financial difficulties, and Im not 
sure what bearing that has on the case. What Im considering is whether Hamsard did 
something wrong when it lent these loans  in line with the rules and regulations at the time. As I have explained, I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for 
these loans because I didnt consider it necessary to do so. But I would say, by this time that 
a proportionate check, in my view, wouldve been verifying the information Miss H had 
provided. Hamsard couldve done this a number of ways, it couldve asked for evidence of 
her income, and her outgoings via the way of copies of bills. Or it couldve asked to see a 
copy of her bank statements. Based on what Ive seen, Im not convinced that any of the 
checks from loan 6 onwards were proportionate. 
But, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Miss H, Hamsard also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded 
during the course of its lending relationship with Miss H. 
I think Hamsard was wrong to have provided loans 6-38 because Miss H wasnt in a position 
to sustainably repay them for the following reasons:
By loan 6, Miss H had been indebted to Hamsard for just over 6 months. During this 
time, she had taken six loans with terms of up to five months, but most of the loans 
were due to be repaid within three to four months. But it seems that Miss H was 
settling these loans quicker than Hamsard had expected, for example, loans 3 to 5.  
So Hamsard ought to have realised it was more likely that Miss H was having longer 
term problems as the need for credit continued.
Miss H appeared to be showing signs that she needed to borrow a new loan as soon 
as (or close to) settling a previous loan. She was granted loan 6 on the same day 
loan 4 had been repaid. Loan 5 was also taken out the same day that loan 3 was 
repaid. A similar pattern continued during the whole lending relationship. This 
continued need for credit ought to have alerted Hamsard to consider whether the 
loans were sustainable.
Miss H was regularly making repayments to a number of loans at the same time. This 
suggests that Miss H wasnt making any real improvements to the amount she owed 
Hamsard. She went on to exhibit the same pattern of borrowing for her subsequent 
loans  and at times had at up to five loans running concurrently.
Loan 6 was Miss Hs largest capital loan to date and loan 5 was also running at the 
same time, meaning she owed (in capital) £320. The total repayments due at this 
time were around £25 per week which is about three times more than what Miss H 
initially paid for her first loan. The weekly repayments didnt sustainably decrease 
over the remaining borrowing period. Indeed, when loans 35 - 38 were running 
concurrently, the weekly repayments came to around £41. So, Miss Hs overall 
indebtedness to Hamsard didnt significantly decrease over the time she borrowed. 
Miss H didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed Hamsard. Loan 38 was 
taken out was taken out six and half years after Miss Hs first. And with this loan (and 
the other concurrent loans) Miss H had around £625 of capital outstanding. Miss H 
had paid interest to, in effect, service a debt to Hamsard over an extended period.
Finally, there are also period in time when Miss H takes significantly longer than Hamsard 
expected for her to repay her loans. For examples loans 6  9 and 20  22. To me, given the 
number of loans, the time in debt and the overlapping nature of these loans is to me a clear 
indicator that Miss H was having wider financial problems. I think that Miss H lost out because Hamsard continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Miss H borrowed and the time she spent in debt was likely 
to have had negative implications on Miss Hs ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these loans.
So, overall, having considered everything Im upholding Miss Hs complaint as I think 
Hamsard were wrong to approve loans 6-38 for these reasons.
Putting things right
In its submissions to us, Hamsard has talked about the 2020 High Court judgement in the 
case of Kerrigan vs Elevate Credit International Limited. Hamsard drew on the Courts 
findings to question assumptions about what might have happened for example had it 
declined the lending in question, and so Miss H had to apply to a third-party lender.
 
In deciding what redress Hamsard should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Miss H from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought 
to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that 
question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss H may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Miss H in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Miss H, would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Hamsards liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Hamsard shouldnt have given Miss H loans 6 - 38. 
If Hamsard has sold the outstanding debts Hamsard should buy these back if it is able to do 
so and then take the following steps. 
A. Hamsard should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss H towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B. Hamsard should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Miss H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss H 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.C. Hamsard should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss H as though they 
had been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Miss 
H having made overpayments then Hamsard should refund these overpayments with 
8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Hamsard should then refund 
the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B can 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a 
surplus then the surplus should be paid to Miss H. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Hamsard should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Miss H.
E. The overall pattern of Miss Hs borrowing for loans 6 - 38 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Hamsard should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Hs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Hamsard should give 
Miss H a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Miss Hs complaint in part.
Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance should put things right for Miss H as directed 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 September 2021.
