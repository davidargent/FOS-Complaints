The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that First Holiday Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C entered into an acquisition agreement for a timeshare points allocation in 
August 2003 for a price of £14,409. They made an advance payment of £5,764 and entered 
into a credit agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of £8,645. The credit agreement 
said that they were to repay the loan by 24 monthly payments of £306.21. Mr C says that 
they wanted to cancel their holiday club membership within the 14 day cooling off period but 
accepted an upgraded membership instead. 
They bought some fractional points in November 2014 for £6,888 which was financed 
through another credit provider. Their representative first made a claim to First Holiday 
Finance that there was an unfair relationship between First Holiday Finance and Mr and 
Mrs C in December 2014. Their representative complained again to First Holiday Finance in 
December 2018 and it responded in January 2019, and again in May 2019 when it also 
provided a response from the timeshare company. Mr and Mrs C complained to this service 
in February 2019.
Their complaint says that: First Holiday Finance paid a commission to the timeshare 
company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs C; a proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Cs 
ability to afford the loan wasnt conducted; the timeshare company unduly pressured Mr and 
Mrs C into entering the contract and the loan agreement; the timeshare was misrepresented 
to Mr and Mrs C; and the timeshare company used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure Mr and Mrs C; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140 of the 
Consumer Credit Act. It said that the compliant wasnt time barred because Mr and Mrs C 
became aware that they had cause for complaint in September 2017. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld. She 
said that Mr and Mrs Cs claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 
1980 so she thought that it wasnt unreasonable for First Holiday Finance to take that into 
account when considering Mr and Mrs Cs claims against it.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Cs claims are time-barred for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Cs complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down their Consumer 
Credit Act claims and I consider that they referred their complaint to this service 
within six years of the event that theyve complained about - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to their claims (Im only considering their 
claims about the August 2003 agreements in this decision as the purchase of 
fractional points in November 2014 was financed by another credit provider);
Mr and Mrs Cs complaint form says that their claims are under section 140 of the 
Consumer Credit Act  but the provisions of section 140 A-D which deal with an 
unfair relationship between a debtor and a creditor werent introduced until 2007  Mr 
and Mrs C entered into the acquisition agreement and credit agreement in August 
2003 which was before those provisions were introduced so I dont consider that Mr 
and Mrs C are able to make a claim under section 140 in these circumstances;
their complaint form refers to issues which could give rise to a claim under section 75 
of the same Act so I need to consider those claims  but in this decision Im not 
determining the outcome of any claim under section 75 as only a court would be able 
to do that - Im only considering whether or not First Holiday Finances response to 
any such claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Cs claim under section 75 would be that the timeshare was 
misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First Holiday Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs C could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the timeshare soon after thy entered into the acquisition agreement in August 
2003 as that was when they entered into an agreement based on the alleged 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as they entered 
into the credit agreement with First Holiday Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at about that time, so they would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or 
First Holiday Finance  but they didnt make a claim against First Holiday Finance 
until December 2014, which was more than eleven years later so was outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act;Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that Mr and Mrs C only became aware that they 
had cause for complaint in September 2017 (but a complaint was made to First 
Holiday Finance in December 2014 so they would have been aware that they had 
cause for complaint before then)  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist them for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr and Mrs Cs claims;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative has said that First Holiday Finance should have told 
them about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging 
the loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, 
if any, was paid by First Holiday Finance to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that First Holiday 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that First 
Holiday Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mr and Mrs C risked the relationship being unfair;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs C 
and that no affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to them;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs C 
and they didnt complain to First Holiday Finance about the affordability of the loan or 
ask it for any information about the affordability assessment until December 2014 
(after theyd bought some fractional points in November 2014)  the loan was made 
in August 2003 and I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about 
the affordability of the loan would now be time-barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs C were 
unduly pressured into entering into the acquisition agreement or credit agreement in 
August 2003 or that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices 
against Mr and Mrs C  they were going to cancel their holiday club membership 
within the 14 day cooling off period but accepted an upgraded membership instead 
and then bought some fractional points in November 2014  I dont consider that they 
would have done so if theyd experienced undue pressure or unacceptable 
commercial practices in August 2003  and they didnt complain to First Holiday 
Finance about those issues until December 2014 (more than eleven years later) and 
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to First 
Holiday Finance about any such issues before then;
I dont consider that First Holiday Finance properly responded to Mr and Mrs Cs 
claims, so I cant say that it acted fairly or reasonably in response to those claims  
but I consider that it wouldnt have upheld those claims if it had properly considered 
them as it would have said that they were time-barred as they werent made within 
the periods set out in the Limitation Act; and 
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs C for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require First Holiday Finance to refund to them any of the money that they paid under 
the credit agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 May 2022.
