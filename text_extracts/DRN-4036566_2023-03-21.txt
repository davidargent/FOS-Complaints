The complaint
This complaint has been brought by the Estate of Mrs C. The estate is represented by Mr C.
The complaint is that Clydesdale Bank Plc, trading as Virgin Money (Virgin Money), did not 
pay all of the money that was due to the estate and about poor service.
What happened
Mr C says he attended a Virgin Money branch on 26 April 2021 with a letter from Mrs C 
requesting that £10,000 be transferred from her savings account into her current account. 
However, instead of accepting the letter, Virgin Money telephoned Mrs C to check she had 
authorised the transaction. Mr C says this telephone call caused Mrs C some considerable 
distress.
Mrs C sadly died on 4 June 2021.
Shortly afterwards, Virgin Money informed Mr C (who is not the executor of the estate) that 
there was a balance of £5,765.41 in Mrs Cs current account; and a balance of £12,976.50 in 
her savings account. At the same time, Virgin Money said that it needed a Grant of Probate 
before it could release funds that were more than £30,000. But even though funds in Mrs Cs 
account were less than £30,000, Virgin Money then said that it needed to see the Grant of 
Probate before funds would be paid from Mrs Cs account.
By way of a letter dated July 2021, the executor instructed Virgin Money to close the 
accounts and pay the proceeds to the estate. Probate was granted on 29 September 2021. 
However, when Virgin Money transferred the outstanding funds on 30 September 2021, it is 
alleged there was a shortfall of almost £7,000.
A complaint was submitted to Virgin Money on or around 5 October 2021. The complaint 
was acknowledged on 11 October 2021. However, no final response was issued within the 
requisite eight weeks and so the complaint was referred to this service. 
A further ground of complaint was that information about the account balances was sent to 
Mr C, rather than the executor. And that when the information was received, the reference 
number could be seen through the window of the envelope.
Our investigator considered the matter but didnt think the complaint should be upheld. In 
particular, he didnt think that Virgin Money had taken any money out of Mrs Cs account. 
However, he did say that it had made a mistake when it told the executor that the balance of 
Mrs Cs account was £12,976.50.
Mrs Cs estate did not accept our investigators view and so the matter was passed to me for 
an ombudsmans decision. 
I issued a provisional decision in this matter. I said: 
I was sorry to see that Mrs C sadly died. I can see how pursuing this complaint 
shortly after her death must have been very difficult for Mrs Cs executor and his 
representative.
I know that my decision will come as a disappointment, but Im afraid I dont intend to 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain why below.
The telephone call to Mrs C on 26 April 2021 I am sorry to hear that the telephone 
call to Mrs C to check the transfer of £10,000 on 26 April 2021 caused her some 
distress. I can appreciate why she may have thought the call was unnecessary if she 
had already given permission to Mr C in the form of a letter.
However, Ive been provided with copies of Mrs Cs bank statements. I can see that 
the requested transfer on 26 April 2021 was for nearly all of the money that was held 
in Mrs Cs savings account at that time. It looks as though the amount of money Mrs 
C wanted to transfer was out of the ordinary compared to how her account was 
usually managed. That means I dont think it was inappropriate for Virgin Money to 
contact Mrs C just to check the transaction she wanted to make was genuine.
The balance of the savings account
I know it is strongly alleged by the representative that Virgin Money did not pay all of 
the money that was due to the estate from Mrs Cs savings account. Ive considered 
this point of complaint very carefully, but I am satisfied that on balance of the 
evidence here  Virgin Money did pay everything that was due to the estate from this 
account.
Looking at the correspondence, I can see that Virgin Money informed Mr C that the 
balance of Mrs Cs savings account on the day she died was £12,976.50. Ive 
compared this with the copies of the statements Virgin Money provided and Im 
satisfied it made a mistake when it wrote to Mr C and said her balance was 
£12,976.50.
I can see the balance was £12,976.50 on 1 April 2021. There was then a card 
transfer of £2,000 on 14 April 2021 from the savings account to the current account. 
This took the balance down to £10.976.50 on 14 April 2021.
Then, as I set out above, on 26 April 2021, Mrs C authorised Mr C to transfer a 
further £10,000 from her savings account to her current account. On the day £10,000 
was transferred out of her account, the balance was £976.50. £5,000 was then 
transferred back from the current account to the savings account on 27 April 2021, 
which meant the balance went up again to £5,976.50
Virgin Money than paid £7.85 in interest on 30 June 2021 and a further £5.22 in 
interest on 30 September 2021. Ive set all of this out below for ease of reference:

30 
September 
2021Interest paid by Virgin 
Money 5.22 5,989.57I understand that £5,989.57 was paid to the executor. And looking at the statements 
that have been provided to me, that was the balance as it stood on the day Mrs Cs 
account was closed.
With all of this in mind, Im satisfied Virgin Money made a mistake when it said the 
balance of Mrs Cs savings account was £12,976.50 in June. That wasnt helpful, but 
as an impartial service, it wouldnt be fair for me to tell Virgin Money that it should pay 
an amount that it only mistakenly said was due. Instead, it should put the estate in 
the position it should have been in, were no error made. Here that means it should 
have said that the balance was £5,989.57.
So while I know that that those representing the estate may have thought that Virgin 
Money should pay it more than it eventually received  Im satisfied that the evidence 
shows Virgin Money has now done what it should have.
The service the estate received from Virgin Money
On behalf of the estate, Mr C told us about several difficulties with Virgin Moneys 
customer service in this case. As I said above, there were issues around whether a 
Grant of Probate was necessary before funds could be released. Issues around the 
correspondence Virgin Money sent to the estate and the representative were also set 
out, as well as how long it took Virgin Money to deal with the complaint.
When Im looking at a case like this, I am bound by the rules set by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the FCA). Those rules are known as the DISP rules and they can 
be found online in the FCAs handbook. They are relevant here because, for the 
purposes of this complaint Mrs Cs estate is the eligible complainant. So while the 
executor is entitled to bring that complaint on the estates behalf (and to appoint Mr C 
to represent them in doing so)  the rules mean I can only consider any impact of 
Virgin Moneys actions on the estate itself, rather than the executor or Mr C as 
individuals. Thats because they dont have a relevant relationship with Virgin Money 
to make them eligible to complain in their own right.
So in considering the impact on the estate, I first have to consider that an estate cant 
feel distress or be upset. I then havent seen anything to suggest the estate lost out 
financially because of the customer service issues mentioned here. And the DISP 
rules say Im unable to tell Virgin Money to personally compensate the executor or 
the representative personally for any inconvenience or distress they were put to 
because of any poor customer service on Virgin Moneys part. That means I cant 
see any grounds to tell Virgin Money to pay any compensation here.
Allegations have been made about Virgin Money acting fraudulently in this case. Ive 
carefully considered what Mr C has said about this and that he may pursue this as a 
criminal matter. He remains free to pursue things in that way, but this service is a free 
and impartial dispute resolution service that acts as an alternative to the courts. Ive 
considered all the evidence from both sides and, while Virgin Money may have made 
a mistake, Ive seen no evidence to support that its acted fraudulently or maliciously 
here.
Virgin Money confirmed it had received my provisional decision, but it did not provide any 
further information or evidence for me to consider. 
On behalf of Mrs Cs estate, Mr C said that I had not taken account of the main point of the 
complaint, which was that there was a shortfall of £6,986.53 in the amount that Virgin Money 
had paid to the executor when the account had been closed. Mr C reiterated that he had 
been directed by the police to report the issue to Action Fraud. What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered the additional information provided on behalf of Mrs Cs estate, but I 
am not persuaded to depart from my provisional findings. 
Mr C said I did not consider the main point of the complaint in that there was a shortfall of 
£6,986.53 between what Virgin Money actually paid to Mrs Cs estate and what it should 
have paid. 
It appears Mrs Cs estate believes there is a shortfall because the balance of her savings 
account was £12,976.50, but only £5,989.57 was paid to the estate. 
In my provisional decision, I explained why the balance of the savings account was not 
£12,976.50 and that the correct balance was £5,989.57. That means my decision is there 
was no shortfall of £6,986.53 or otherwise. To be clear, I am satisfied that Virgin Money paid 
all that was owed to the estate. I cannot see that Virgin Money withheld any funds that were 
due to Mrs Cs estate. 
I do appreciate that my decision will be very disappointing to the executor and to Mr C. But 
for the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint and I dont require Virgin Money 
to take any further action in this case. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint about Clydesdale Bank, trading as Virgin Money. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mrs C 
to accept or reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
