The complaint
Miss P complains that she cant access her TransUnion International UK Limited credit 
report online. Shes unhappy with TransUnions response to her concerns.
What happened
In 2021, Miss P wanted to make use of some of the third-party platforms which offer 
consumers detailed information about how to improve their credit score. Miss P found she 
had difficulty accessing these platforms.
After investigating further, Miss P found that the platforms rely on data supplied by 
TransUnion. When Miss P tried to view her TransUnion credit report online, she couldnt gain 
access. Miss P thought shed accurately answered all of TransUnions questions to validate 
her identity.
TransUnion told Miss P that it wasnt possible to tell her why the online system couldnt verify 
her identity. TransUnion offered to send Miss P a hard copy of her credit report so she could 
check whether her data was correct.
Miss P is unhappy with this as shes sure that her inability to verify her identity with 
TransUnion is impacting her ability to access the other platforms. Miss P is concerned that 
someone else may have accessed her data and somehow changed things so she cant pass 
security.
The investigator wanted TransUnion to share details of the security process it wouldve 
taken Miss P through to verify her identity. When it wouldnt do this, the investigator 
recommended that TransUnion pay Miss P £100 compensation as she couldnt be sure that 
TransUnion had treated Miss P fairly.
TransUnion doesnt agree with the investigators recommendation. It doesnt think it did 
anything wrong and says it tried to help Miss P by sending her a copy of her credit file in the 
post. TransUnion is very concerned about releasing confidential information about its own 
security processes. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so 
using my own words. Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the key issues. The rules 
that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt mean that Ive not considered 
everything that both parties have given to me.
TransUnion has its own automated verification processes that its entitled to use. If 
TransUnion cant verify a consumer, it wont allow online access to their report. While I 
understand this, Miss P is adamant that she gave TransUnion the correct personal 
information to verify herself. Although TransUnion says it hasnt treated Miss P differently to 
any other customers going through its security process, it hasnt given me evidence of this 
despite our requests.
I appreciate the need for TransUnion to keep its processes confidential and secure but its 
possible  as we have told TransUnion  for it to share this information with us on a 
confidential basis. Without seeing it myself, I cant reasonably find that TransUnion treated 
Miss P fairly and in line with its usual processes.
Although TransUnion sent Miss P her statutory report to make sure that her data is correct, 
she remains concerned that someone else has accessed her information online because 
Miss P, as a genuine customer, cannot access it herself. Again, without further evidence 
from TransUnion, its not possible for me to know that this hasnt happened.
Overall, I agree with the investigator that its reasonable to require TransUnion to pay Miss P 
£100 compensation for the upset shes faced trying to gain access to her credit information 
online.
Putting things right
I require TransUnion International UK Limited to pay Miss P £100.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ps complaint and direct TransUnion International UK 
Limited to make the above payment.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 August 2022.
