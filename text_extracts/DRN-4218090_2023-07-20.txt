The complaint
Mr and Mrs G are unhappy with how Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited dealt with a 
claim they made on a home emergency insurance policy.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
It isnt in dispute the service RSA provided on this occasion fell below what should 
normally be expected. Incorrect information was given about the time Mr and Mrs G 
could expect an engineer to attend and other appointments were cancelled. And 
ultimately, Mr and Mrs G were left without a functioning boiler while parts were 
sourced for it.
I do think Mr and Mrs G were caused unnecessary inconvenience and for that, they 
should be compensated. Overall, I think £200 adequately reflects RSAs service 
failings and the impact it had on Mr and Mrs G.
Rather than waiting any longer for the boiler to be repaired, Mr and Mrs G chose to 
replace it and borrowed money to do so.  While I appreciate why Mr and Mrs G did 
this and that theyd lost faith in RSAs ability to fix the boiler, ultimately it was their 
decision to pay for a new one. I wont therefore be awarding anything additional here 
to reflect this.
For these reasons I uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr and Mrs Gs complaint against Royal & Sun Alliance 
Insurance Limited. I direct it to pay them a total of £200 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 August 2023.
