K822xcomplaint
Mrs P complaints about the poor service she received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest).
background 
Mrs P said NatWest agreed to send  weekly bank statements to her address. Shed been  
unable to use her mobile banking  and needed  to manage her account.  She received the 
statements for about 4 weeks.  And when they stopped she spent a lot of time trying to 
contact NatWest to find out why. 
Mrs P said she was on hold each time she rang the bank.  And she had to visit her branch to 
get copy statements. Mrs P is unhappy with the time it has taken NatWest to resolve the 
issue. So she wants NatWest to acknowledge the problems and restore  her weekly  
statements.
NatWest said some of its post to Mrs P had been  returned undelivered. So itd been 
redirected to the branch until Mrs P was able to confirm her address. NatWest  said it sent 
Mrs P a text and an email  about the problem.  And it asked her to visit a branch with proof of 
address so it could  update its records. 
Mrs P wasnt  satisfied  with Bs response.  So she contacted our service  and our investigator 
looked into the matter. He could see Mrs P said she hadnt seen either  the text or email. But 
he felt it was likely Lloyds  had sent them. And he felt NatWest had tried to make Mrs P 
aware she needed to visit her branch  to confirm her address.
He could see Mrs P had been  visiting  her branch to get paper copies of her statements. And 
shed been talking to the bank by telephone. But neither party seemed to have asked why 
there was a block on Mrs P address. So he didnt think NatWest had treated Mrs P unfairly. 
But he felt Mrs P had put a lot of effort into trying to get her weekly statements restored. So 
he felt NatWest should compensate Mrs P with £100  for her time and effort.
Although NatWest agreed Mrs P didnt think it was enough. She said NatWest hadnt set up 
a complaint properly  after shed spent  a long time on the phone  trying to sort things out. And 
shes had to take annual leave for the time shes taken from work. So she wants  further 
compensation. And shes asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand Mrs Ps frustration. She couldnt use her mobile banking. So she requested 
weekly statements to help her manage  her account. But they stopped coming through and 
she had to visit her branch to get paper copies.  Mrs P feels let down by the service shes 
received. So Ive looked carefully at everything  thats happened. And what NatWest should  
do to put things right.
It seems  NatWest  redirected Mrs Ps statements  to her branch  after some post had been 
returned undelivered. And it sent Mrs P a text and email asking for an updated address. 
Ref: DRN27005592I think thats a sensible  response to make sure its customer records are up to date. It stops 
correspondence going to the wrong  person. But NatWest didnt receive a reply  from Mrs P. 
So it stopped sending her statements and she had to visit her branch to get copies.
Unfortunately it doesnt seem either  Mrs P or NatWest really  queried what was going wrong 
and the situation continued  for some  time.  And it caused Mrs P further inconvenience. When  
she spoke to NatWest  it didnt set things up as a complaint when  she asked and Mrs P had 
to spend even more time sorting things  out.
NatWest did try and inform Mrs P there  was a problem with her post. It sent an email and a 
text telling her about the issue. And I think NatWest  were right to redirect Mrs Ps statements 
until it could confirm her address. But I do think it has taken longer than it shouldve  to sort 
things out. And I recognise the effort Mrs P has put into this matter. So I agree with our 
investigator that NatWest  should compensate Mrs P for the trouble and upset shes  suffered.
I have looked  at what Mrs P said about  taking time off work and the costs shes  incurred. 
And I have  also considered NatWests actions in protecting her account details when it 
thought there might  be a problem. I think that was the right response.  And Ive not seen 
anything to suggest it didnt send both a text and an email to alert Mrs P when the problem 
arose. So if Mrs P had seen the messages it couldve been resolved sooner.
NatWest has agreed to pay Mrs P £100 compensation for her trouble and upset. I think 
thats a fair and reasonable amount given the nature of the complaint and the impact its had 
on Mrs P. And its in line with the sort of award  our service normally  makes.  I realise Mrs P 
will be disappointed with this amount. But, taking into account  everything thats happened, I 
think thats the right outcome.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should  pay Mrs P £100 
compensation as it has already agreed to do.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2019.
