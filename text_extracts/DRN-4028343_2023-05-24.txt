The complaint
In summary, Mrs A has complained about a failed chargeback claim that was made through 
National Westminster Bank Plc. 
What happened
In June 2022, Mrs A bought an item using her Visa debit card. She encountered problems 
with the item shortly after buying it. 
Unhappy with the quality of the item she purchased, Mrs A raised a chargeback claim with 
NatWest. She provided it with information in relation to her claim. 
The merchant contested the claim and provided documentation explaining why it didnt 
agree with Mrs As claim. Mrs A didnt agree, so the claim was referred to arbitration by 
NatWest under the Visa cardholder scheme rules.
Visa ruled in favour of the merchant. Dissatisfied with the ruling and NatWests conduct of 
her claim, Mrs A complained to NatWest. It didnt uphold Mrs As complaint in respect of the 
outcome of her chargeback claim. It apologised for the length of time she had spent on the 
phone trying to resolve the dispute and how time consuming it had been. It upheld that 
aspect of her complaint and credited her account with £50 in compensation. 
Mrs A subsequently contacted NatWest again to complain about the information she had 
been given about when she would receive the outcome of her dispute and misleading 
information, she thought NatWest had given her. It accepted she had been given misleading 
information and more than one time frame for when she should receive the outcome. It 
credited her account with another £50 compensation for the poor service she had received. 
Mrs As concerns were looked into by one of our investigators. They explained why they 
werent upholding her complaint in respect of the chargeback claim. They agreed that there 
were shortcomings in the way NatWest handled the claim and communicated with her, but 
they thought the compensation it had paid was sufficient to reflect the impact of those 
shortcomings. 
Mrs A didnt agree. She said she had been told by NatWest that it had everything it needed. 
She suffered from anxiety and other illness triggered by stress. And was told it would likely 
go in her favour and was upset when she received an unfavourable outcome. She thought a 
payment of £500 was appropriate. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided not to uphold Mrs As complaint. Ive set out my reasoning 
below. 
Mrs A is unhappy with the way NatWest dealt with the chargeback claim that she made. I do 
understand from what Mrs A has said, why from her point of view, she feels aggrieved that 
the chargeback claim wasnt upheld in her favour. 
I think given the circumstances of Mrs As chargeback claim, it was appropriate for NatWest 
to have referred the case to arbitration with Visa. Mrs As claim related to the quality of the 
item she bought. 
NatWest accepts that the service it provided to Mrs A wasnt what it should have been. But 
Im satisfied that this didnt have an impact on the chargeback claim being considered by 
Visa. NatWest provided the information to Visa for the claim to be considered and within the 
timeframes set by the scheme. And the claim was considered by Visa in line with its rules.
The merchant contested the claim. The case went to arbitration and Visa ruled in favour of 
the merchant, because it didnt think sufficient steps had been taken to return the purchased 
item to meet all its requirements to attempt to return the item.
NatWest isnt responsible for deciding whether the chargeback claim should be upheld or 
not. That was a matter for Visa the card scheme operator to decide, not NatWest. So, I dont 
think NatWest did anything wrong in respect of the chargeback claim being assessed.
As Ive already outlined, Mrs A is also unhappy with how NatWest progressed her 
chargeback claim and the incorrect information she thinks NatWest gave her. And as Ive 
said and as NatWest has acknowledged, there were shortcomings in the service and 
information it provided to her.
I do understand that Mrs A is disappointed that her chargeback claim was declined. But as 
Ive explained that isnt as a result of anything NatWest did or didnt do. Mrs A is upset with 
the amount of time she had to spend dealing with this claim through NatWest. I can 
understand that may have been frustrating for her, but there is always a degree of time and 
inconvenience involved in raising and pursuing a claim such as the one Mrs A has in this 
case. 
Although there were shortcomings in the way NatWest handled the claim and in how it 
communicated with her, it seems to me from what Mrs A said, that a lot of her upset is as a 
result of her claim being declined. But as Ive explained that isnt down to anything NatWest 
has done, and I cant hold it responsible for her claim being declined and the upset that has 
caused her. Im satisfied that the compensation it has offered in relation to the poor service it 
acknowledges it provided, is sufficient to reflect the impact of those shortcomings. I dont 
think it needs to do anymore.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, my decision is not to uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2023.
