Mr D says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr D had seven loans  with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information  QuickQuid 
provided about the loans  in the table below. Loans  denoted with both a letter  and a number 
are top-ups   this is where extra funds were  borrowed  during the course  of the credit  
agreement. Mr D topped-up his loans 12 times, so overall there were 19 lending decisions 
between October 2017 and October 2018.

**some figures  rounded  or estimated
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. He didnt 
think QuickQuid had acted responsibly  when it approved the second top-up on loan 4 (4b in 
my table) or any of the subsequent loans. QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the 
complaint was passed to me to decide. 
Since the adjudication theres been  no further  dispute about loans 1-4a, so Ive only 
considered the loans  still in dispute in my decision.  I may refer to earlier loans but only 
insofar as they form part of the history of lending.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Ive seen that before providing  the loans in question, QuickQuid recorded information about  
Mr Ds income  and employment status. It recorded  Mr Ds net monthly income  as £1,500  
until loan 5c and then as £1,180 from loan 6 onwards. It also recorded  information about his 
Ref: DRN74634172expenditure  Mr Ds total monthly  living expenses were recorded as £575  until loan 5c and 
as £725 from loan 6 onwards. 
QuickQuid also carried out credit checks but hasnt provided the results of these checks.  It 
has however told us that for loan 6 it obtained  information to show Mr D had £73 of other 
credit commitments  and that he had £340 of other credit commitments  at the time of loan 7.
Along with its case-specific submissions, QuickQuid provided a document setting  out its 
general lending  practices.  This Service has responded to QuickQuid about this generic  
document directly  and through earlier final decisions. So Im not going to refer to it in my 
decision, though I have  considered it alongside everything else in making my decision. 
loans 4b-7b
Loan 4b was approved  about five months into the lending relationship.  The base loan (loan  
4) followed loan 3 by about a month and was for a larger amount than the preceding loans. It 
was originally structured  so that there  would be two payments  £46 on 27 March and then 
£312 on 27 April.  All of the top-ups on loan 4 were  approved before the first payment was 
due and the top-ups doubled  the size of the loan.
Bearing in mind the purpose of these  short-term loans, I think  QuickQuid ought to have been  
concerned that Mr D had asked for so many  top-ups in such a short  space of time. The first 
top-up (4a) was quite  small   so I think less concerning. But the second (4b) increased the 
largest loan payment to £561   about 37% of Mr Ds monthly  income. The third top-up (4c) 
increased the largest payment to about  42% of Mr Ds monthly income.
I dont think QuickQuid shouldve approved  the second and third top-ups on loan 4. The 
pattern of lending here, particularly the frequent top-ups, combined with the size of the 
largest payments  on loans 4b and 4c, created a significant risk that Mr D wouldnt be able to 
sustainably repay  the loans  and would likely have to borrow  again.  
I understand that QuickQuid had estimated that Mr Ds disposable income  at this time was 
£818 a month.  But I think it had reason  to doubt its estimate  I dont think  Mr D wouldve 
been borrowing  repeatedly in the way he was if he really had so much  disposable income.  
And that he was borrowing regularly during the course of the loan agreements,  before  even  
making the first repayments, ought to have caused  QuickQuid to question whether Mr Ds 
need for extra borrowing was only a short-term  issue.
Ref: DRN74634173The pattern  of frequent borrowing, including topping-up loans, continued through the lending 
relationship. There  were no significant gaps between  the loans and each loan was topped-
up two or three times. The period of lending without a significant break was about a year.  
The amounts Mr D was borrowing did decrease  for loans  6 and 7. But this happened 
relatively late in the chain  of lending and at the time of loan 7 QuickQuid was aware from its 
credit checks that Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing with other lenders and his income  
had decreased. The lower loan amounts may simply reflect Mr Ds lower income and higher 
expenditure, rather than a decrease in what he actually needed or wanted to borrow. So I 
think the decreasing  amounts being borrowed  are less likely to reflect that Mr Ds financial 
situation was improving.
In summary,  I think QuickQuid ought to have realised that further lending was likely to be 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful by the time Mr D applied for loan 4b. By this time, it 
should have been reasonably clear to QuickQuid that Mr D wasnt likely  to be taking  out 
these loans because  of a short-term need  and that approving further loans  would unfairly 
prolong his indebtedness by allowing him to take out expensive  credit over an extended 
period of time. And the sheer  number  of loans and top-ups would likely have had negative 
implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
Ive thought about the points QuickQuid raised  in response to the adjudicator. Its said its 
checks suggested Mr D had enough  disposable  income to repay each loan. And that each 
loan was repaid  successfully  (except the last).  As Ive explained above, I dont think it was 
reasonable for QuickQuid to keep relying on its estimate of Mr Ds disposable income, given 
the pattern  of borrowing  which had been established  by loan 4b. It relied  quite heavily on 
what Mr D was telling it about  his expenditure to arrive at the estimates  and by the time of 
loan 4b I dont think it was proportionate  to continue to do this. And although Mr D did repay 
all but the last of his loans, I think the pattern of lending indicates he wasnt  doing so 
sustainably  because  he kept borrowing for a year. That the lending became unsustainable  
is borne  out by Mr Ds inability to repay  the last loan.
So Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about  loans  4b to 7b because the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr D paid as a result of the top-ups 4b and 4c and 
the interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 5 and 6, including all the top-ups on 
those loans
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr D paid them until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 4b-5c (inclusive) from Mr Ds credit  
history and remove all information about  loans 6-7b
I understand theres still an outstanding  balance on loan 7 (including the top-ups).  So 
QuickQuid should  remove any interest and charges from that balance and treat any 
payments made by Mr D as if they were  payments  towards the principal. QuickQuid  can then 
offset the balance against  what it owes Mr D.
Ref: DRN74634174HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr D a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 May 2019.
