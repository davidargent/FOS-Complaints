The complaint
Miss L and Mr R complain that an appointed representative of Mortgage Advice Bureau 
Limited (MABL) misled them about the amount theyd be able to borrow. They had to raise 
money for a larger deposit at short notice. They ask for compensation for their financial loss.
What happened
Miss L and Mr R took mortgage advice from MABL in mid-2021. It made a mortgage 
application on their behalf. The application had to be changed after the property was valued 
at less than the purchase price. Mr R says MABL misled them that theyd be able to get a 
95% mortgage. This wasnt the case and in order to proceed they had to find a larger 
deposit. They say if theyd known sooner theyd have negotiated a lower price with the 
vendor.
Our investigator said while MABL had made an error, the outcome would always have been 
the same. She said the £250 offered by MABL was fair in the circumstances. Miss L and 
Mr R didnt agree. Mr R said MABL misled them throughout the application process, causing 
them significant financial loss. He said theyd have acted differently if theyd been given 
correct information about the amount the lender would lend to them.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Timing is important to the outcome of this complaint, so Ive briefly summarised what 
happened below.
19 May 2021: a decision in principle (DIP) was issued for a loan of £333,000. The loan was 
90% of the agreed purchase price of £370,000. MABL made an application to the lender on 
behalf of Mr R and Miss L. 
16 June 2021: the property was valued at £345,000. This meant the lender wouldnt lend 
£333,000. MABL asked Miss L and Mr R how theyd like to proceed. It said if they wanted to 
continue with that lender theyd need to re-negotiate the price or provide a deposit of 
£42,000 (this would have been the deposit required for a 95% LTV mortgage at the original 
purchase price of £370,000).
17 June 2021: Mr R said theyd agreed a lower price with the seller of £352,000. MABL said 
it would go back to the lender and ask for a loan of £328,000 (95% of £345,000). 
21 June 2021: the lender asked MABL to choose a 95% LTV product. When it tried to do so, 
it found none were available for a mortgage of the amount Mr R and Miss L wanted. Mr R 
and Miss L were told theyd need a 10% deposit to continue with that lender.
22 June 2021: a mortgage offer was issued for a loan of £311,000. Mr R and Miss L needed 
to find a deposit of £41,000. 
Did MABL make an error?
I dont think its fair to say that MABL gave Mr R and Miss L incorrect information throughout 
the process. The original application and DIP was for a 90% mortgage. Mr R and Miss L 
applied to borrow £333,000 with a deposit of £37,000. I havent seen anything to suggest 
Mr R and Miss L were misled about this or that there was any reason why MABL needed to 
tell them at this point that a 95% mortgage wasnt available to them. 
The situation changed on 16 June 2021, when the property was valued at £25,000 less than 
the purchase price. At this point, Mr R and Miss L were given incorrect information. They 
were led to believe that a 95% mortgage might be available to them. MABL ought to have 
checked that the lender would offer a 95% LTV mortgage and a suitable product. Mr R and 
Miss L were given correct information on 21 June 2021.
What effect did MABLs error have?
Having considered the available evidence, I dont think matters would have been different if 
Mr R and Miss L had been given correct information on 16 June 2021, instead of on 21 June 
2021. Ive explained why below:
Timing was important to Mr R and Miss L. Mr R told MABL he wanted to stay with the 
same lender in order to complete by the end of June 2021. He says theyd given notice 
to leave the property they were living in, and their sellers position meant there wasnt 
time to switch lender or renegotiate. Mr R says the stamp duty holiday offered by the UK 
government (which was due to end at the end of June 2021) isnt relevant.
While Mr R and Miss L could have started an application with a different lender on 16 
June 2021 I think its unlikely theyd have done so. There was less than two weeks 
before the end of June 2021. They couldnt have been sure an application to another 
lender would be approved in time  or at all. 
Mr R says if theyd known the lender didnt offer 95% LTV mortgages theyd have 
negotiated a lower price with the vendor. After the property was valued at £345,000, 
Mr R and Miss L agreed a lower price with the vendor. However, this was still about 
£7,000 more than the valuation. I think if they had been able to negotiate a lower price 
with the vendor theyd have done so after the valuation.
Given that Mr R and Miss L agreed to pay more than the valuation, I think its likely they 
were keen to go ahead with this property. I cant see why theyd have made a different 
decision if theyd been told they could only have a 90% mortgage on 16 June 2021. 
Theres no guarantee the vendor would have agreed a lower price if Mr R and Miss L 
had known the lender didnt offer 95% loans on 16 June 2021. Ultimately, Mr R and 
Miss L could have decided not to go ahead with the purchase if they werent happy with 
the price or the amount they were able to borrow.
Mr R and Miss Ls original application was made on the basis of a 90% mortgage with a 
purchase price of £370,000. If their application had proceeded on the basis of the 
original purchase price and the DIP, Mr R and Miss L would have needed a deposit of 
£37,000. It was only for the relatively short period (16 to 21 June 2021) that Mr R and Miss L thought theyd only need a deposit of £24,000. 
Mr R said they had to find a deposit of £41,500 instead of £24,000 as theyd expected. 
But, as I say, until 16 June 2021 theyd expected to pay a deposit of £37,000. 
Mr R and Miss L did need to find an additional amount (about £4,500) to make up the 
deposit to £41,500. This wasnt because of the error by MABL. They needed a larger 
deposit because the valuation (on which the lender based the LTV calculation) was lower 
than the price they agreed to pay for the property. 
Mr R told MABL hed pay the deposit from his savings. He said he could provide 
evidence of this and it wouldnt result in additional borrowing. If this wasnt right, or Mr R 
and Miss L did decide to take out more debt, I dont think MABL is responsible for this.
Mr R says theyd have had a lot more time to decide what to do if theyd been given correct 
information. Theyd have had an extra five days. But, for the reasons Ive given, I dont think 
Mr R and Miss L would have done things differently if they had been given correct 
information on 16 June 2021.
MABL offered compensation of £250 for any distress and inconvenience caused to Mr R and 
Miss L. I dont think Mr R and Miss L had any financial loss due to MABLs error  as I said I 
dont think theyd have done anything differently. And the misleading impression they were 
given about the amount they could borrow was put right in less than a week. I appreciate 
Mr R and Miss L were disappointed that a 95% mortgage wasnt available after all. Overall 
though, I think the £250 offered by MABL for the upset caused is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that (if it hasnt already done so) Mortgage Advice Bureau Limited should pay 
£250 to Miss L and Mr R, as if offered to do. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L and Mr R to 
accept or reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
