The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly applied an early repayment 
charge (ERC) when hed wanted to port his mortgage. He asks that it refunds the ERC.
What happened
Mr P contacted NatWest on 23 November 2021 as he wanted to port his mortgage. The sale 
of his property was due to complete on 26 November 2021. NatWest said it wasnt possible 
to complete a porting application in this time. It said it didnt have any appointments with 
mortgage advisers available before 26 November 2021. 
Mr P repaid his mortgage and NatWest applied an ERC. Mr P says this is unfair. He says 
NatWest didnt tell him about its timescales and it should have had more mortgage advisers 
available.
Our investigator said NatWest hadnt treated Mr P unfairly. 
Mr P didnt agree. He said hed asked NatWest about porting and hadnt been given a 
timescale. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P took out a five-year fixed interest rate product in 2020. This included an ERC, which 
was clearly set out in the mortgage offer in the form of a table. Mr P agreed to this when he 
took out the product. 
On 23 November 2021 Mr P told NatWest he wanted to apply to port his mortgage. This was 
three days before he was due to complete on his sale. NatWest said this wasnt possible in 
the available time. It couldnt offer Mr P an appointment with a mortgage adviser before 26 
November 2022.
Mr P repaid the mortgage and NatWest applied the ERC, as it was entitled to do under the 
mortgage terms and conditions. Mr P says this was unfair as he wanted to port the mortgage 
product to his new property. He says he wasnt told about NatWests timescales, and it was 
NatWests responsibility to ensure it had enough mortgage advisers.
I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to refund the ERC. Ive explained 
why below.
The mortgage offer sent to Mr P in 2020 said the mortgage was portable subject to a list of 
terms. The first was that you must have applied to port your existing mortgage product 
before redeeming your existing mortgage.
Mr P contacted NatWest by webchat in August 2021 to ask if the mortgage was portable and 
if he could add his wife to the mortgage. NatWest confirmed this was possible, and said:
If you are looking to move house (port) then you will still go through the normal 
application process for the house that you are looking to purchase ie income 
assessment, credit check and valuation on the property that you are looking to 
purchase. Porting the mortgage means you will take the interest rate onto the new 
property with you and this will be subject to a full application with a mortgage adviser.
You would need to sell your current property to be eligible to port and your new 
application would need to be submitted before you close your current mortgage.
Mr P contacted NatWest in October and November 2021 to ask about the ERC and for his 
account number. He asked for a redemption statement on 10 November 2021 with a 
repayment date of 26 November 2021. He didnt ask to make a porting application or ask 
about timing. 
Mr P didnt ask to make a porting application until 23 November 2021. NatWest couldnt offer 
him an appointment with a mortgage adviser before 26 November 2021 as they were fully 
booked. 
NatWest said there was a longer wait for appointments than usual due to high levels of 
demand. NatWest says even without this, it wouldnt expect to offer an appointment 
immediately, or the next day. And the mortgage adviser would have needed to collect all the 
necessary information and supporting documents from Mr P (and his wife if this was to be a 
joint mortgage) before submitting an application. NatWest says even at normal service levels 
it wouldnt have been able to complete an application for Mr P in the available time.
I think, fairly, NatWest needed to offer Mr P an appointment within a reasonable timescale. It 
didnt have to offer an appointment within two days. I dont think Mr P missed out on the 
opportunity to submit a porting application before he repaid his mortgage because NatWest 
treated him unfairly or made an error. I think he missed out because hed left it too late to 
ask to make an application.
Mr P says NatWest hadnt told him about its timescales. But I think NatWest gave Mr P clear 
information in August 2021 about having to go through the normal application process 
(including an income assessment, credit check and property valuation) and that the 
application must be submitted before the existing mortgage was repaid. I dont think 
NatWest could reasonably have known that Mr P would expect to be able to do this within a 
couple of days prior to repaying his mortgage. 
In the circumstances I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to refund the 
ERC.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2022.
