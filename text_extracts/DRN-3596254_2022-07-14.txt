The complaint
Mrs B complains that the loans she had from Shelby Finance Ltd (trading as Dot Dot Loans)
were unaffordable.
What happened
Mrs B had four loans from Dot Dot Loans between March 2020 and August 2021 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 14 Mar 2020 £200 3m £105.50 19 Jun 2020 On time
2 9 Aug 2020 £250 6m £79.12 19 Feb 2021 30 Nov 2020
3 31 Jan 2021 £200 6m £60.57 20 Jul 2021 19 Feb 2021
4 28 Aug 2021 £200 3m £95.61 19 Nov 2021 21 Oct 2021
Mrs B says she was thousands of pounds in debt at the time of the borrowing and was 
borrowing from one lender to repay another. She says that the checks Dot Dot Loans 
said it carried out did not go far enough as she had multiple short-term loans, credit 
cards and mail order accounts at the time. Mrs B says the lending has caused her 
significant issues, both financially and mentally, and the impact on her credit file has 
affected her chances of applying for a mortgage.
Dot Dot Loans says it asked Mrs B about her income and expenditure and checked her 
credit record. Dot Dot Loans says it verified her income and reviewed the expenditure 
using statistical averages as guidance. It found Mrs B had sufficient disposable income 
to afford the repayments.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. She found Mrs B was
showing signs she was struggling to manage her money when she applied for loan 3. She
recommended that interest and charges should be refunded on loan 3 (plus 8% statutory
interest), and that adverse information about it should be removed from Mrs Bs credit file.
Dot Dot Loans responded to say that it wanted the case reviewed by an ombudsman.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mrs B and to Dot Dot Loans on 15 June 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings:
For loans 1 and 2, I was satisfied Dot Dot Loans carried out proportionate checks 
and made fair lending decisions;
I was satisfied Dot Dot Loanss checks went far enough for loan 3 because:
oThe scheduled repayments were less than 2% of Mrs Bs income;
oShe had a good repayment record for her first two loans;
oThere were small gaps between loans;
oAlthough the credit check showed Mrs Bs total debt had increased from 
£2,000 to over £5,000, I didnt find this to be unreasonable for someone 
with a monthly income of £3,400, especially as she was carrying out home 
improvements;
oMrs Bs credit file showed no County Court Judgements, repayment plans, 
accounts in debt management or recent short-term loans. There were also 
no defaults in addition to an historical £51 debt;
oDot Dot Loans calculated Mrs B had disposable income of £1,800 with which 
to make the £60 repayments;
So I didnt find that the loan 3 repayments were unsustainable or that the lending was 
irresponsible;
Mrs B applied for loan 4 more than six months after repaying loan 3 and the results of 
the checks showed a similar picture to loan 3;
With the gap in lending, I found it reasonable that Dot Dot Loans would consider 
Mrs B had broken out of any cycle of dependency of borrowing and I was satisfied 
there was nothing to indicate it would be proportionate to make further checks or that 
Mrs B was struggling to manage her money;
I couldnt conclude Dot Dot Loans was irresponsible to have approved loan 4.
In summary, I found Dot Dot Loans made a fair lending decision for all the loans.
Dot Dot Loans responded to accept my provisional decision.
Mrs B did not respond to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional information, I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusion I reached.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2022.
