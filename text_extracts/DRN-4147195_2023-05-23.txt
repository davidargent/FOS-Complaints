The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as W, complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc 
conducted a review of Ws business profile, which resulted in restrictions being placed on 
Ws account.
Mr B, a director of W, brings the complaint on Ws behalf.
What happened
The circumstances of this complaint are familiar to both parties.
In August 2021, NatWest began a process to review Ws business profile. NatWest is 
required to complete these periodic checks to comply with its regulatory obligations. W has 
expressed no concerns about the need for NatWest to conduct these checks.
As part of its review, NatWest sought to identify shareholders in W with a stake greater than 
10%. NatWest looked on Companies House and saw that a company with a name I shall call 
P held more than a 10% shareholding in W. It identified a company in the UK with that name, 
which I shall call PUK, and updated Ws business profile to say that PUK held more than 
10% of W. However, later it became clear that this presumption was wrong.
Between September and November 2021, NatWest sent several letters and text messages 
to W asking for certain information. Amongst other things, it appeared to W that NatWest 
wanted the names and dates of birth of all Ws shareholders. 
In late November, NatWest spoke with W to clarify what it needed. NatWest now said that it 
didnt need the details of all Ws shareholders, just those of P, as it said P owned more than 
10% of W. NatWest warned W that, if it did not receive the required information by 24 
January 2022, it would restrict access to Ws account. 
W sought to gather the information requested by NatWest, and sought to edit the pages in 
the business profile section of NatWests portal but without much success. W contacted its 
shareholder with the name P to obtain the required information. However, although it didnt 
know this at the time, its shareholder wasnt PUK but a separate company which shared the 
name P but was based overseas. I shall call this company PO.
In December, NatWest spoke with W again and discussed the ownership structure for W. 
NatWest said that as P (meaning PUK) had only one shareholder, who would therefore own 
indirectly more than 10% of W, it required information about this shareholder of PUK.
W sought to obtain the information required by NatWest from PO, believing it was the 
company identified by NatWest as its shareholder. However, PO refused to supply this 
personal information about its own shareholder. PO said that it was willing to supply the 
information directly to NatWest, which W communicated to NatWest. W expected NatWest to 
contact PO to obtain the required information and believed the matter would now be 
resolved. However, NatWest had no facility for engaging with a shareholder in W in this way, 
so the information gaps remained.
It is apparent that, had PO shared the requested information with W, it would have revealed 
at that time that PO was different to PUK, which NatWest had erroneously recorded on Ws 
business profile. This would have enabled NatWest to correct its records and realise that no 
shareholder in PO had an indirect shareholding in W of more than 10%.
In early January 2022, NatWest sent a further text message and spoke with W to notify it 
that the required information remained outstanding. However, having sought to obtain the 
information from PO, and provided contact information for PO to NatWest, W believed it had 
done all it could. 
On 24 January, NatWest sent a letter to W saying that, as it still hadnt received the 
information required, restrictions would be put on Ws account. This happened two days 
later.
In early February, unaware that the restrictions were already in place, W phoned NatWest to 
clarify the requests, explain the problems it was having with NatWests portal and to request 
help in providing the required information so that matters could be resolved. W was guided 
to complete a declaration of beneficial interest form, which W downloaded, completed and 
posted to NatWest. During this call, NatWest checked the records for PUK again at 
Companies House and discovered that PUK was being wound up.
A couple of days later, W became aware that its account had been frozen. It phoned 
NatWest and initiated a complaint. During this call, W was left with the impression that the 
restrictions would be removed, but this didnt happen.
A few days later, W spoke with NatWest again. It continued to express its deep frustration at 
the restrictions in place on its account when it didnt know what it could do to satisfy 
NatWests requirements. W expected NatWest to call back to clarify matters, but this didnt 
happen until 16 February.
On 16 February, NatWest explained to W for the first time that it couldnt contact PO as it 
was unable to engage with Ws shareholders directly. It said that it was for W to gain the 
required information from its shareholder. 
Later that day, W spoke with PO. In this call, it finally became apparent that PO and PUK 
were separate and unrelated businesses. Until this time, W had been unaware that PO was 
different to PUK. The fact that PUK and PO shared an identical business name had 
confused both W and NatWest. W phoned NatWest immediately to explain. 
W informed NatWest that PO had two shareholders and no individual shareholder in PO 
controlled its shareholding in W. The NatWest employee informed W that they would
make enquiries and call W back, but that didnt happen. W had requested the account 
restrictions to be immediately removed, but that also didnt happen.
W spoke with NatWest twice on 23 February but without moving matters on. The first call 
concerned the portal, but NatWest was unable to help W access the required ownership 
structure chart which needed completing; and the second call suggested that the chart 
wasnt needed anyway, in part because the 10% threshold signalled early in the process 
was the wrong threshold. W remained confused, and the restrictions remained in place. In 
this call, NatWest booked an appointment for W with its technical team to resolve matters 
with the portal, but the earliest date available was 7 March. NatWest later apologised for this 
long wait time.On 25 February, W called NatWest to chase up what was happening. NatWest confirmed 
that theyd received Ws declaration of beneficial ownership, but it still required a complete 
ownership structure chart. In this call, NatWest said that, given the appointment with the 
technical team on 7 March, it would seek to release the restrictions temporarily. However, 
this never happened. Following the call, W uploaded its best attempt at an ownership 
structure chart through the portal. On this form, W explained clearly that PO owns 11% of W, 
with two individual shareholders each owning 50% of PO  and thereby each owning 5.6% 
of W. 
At the end of February, having reviewed Ws declaration of beneficial ownership, NatWest 
found there to be gaps in the information provided and determined that it had still not been 
provided in the correct format. 
On 3 March 2022, W posted its ownership structure chart to NatWest. It is not clear from the 
records what NatWest did with this document, but it is apparent that it also did not resolve 
matters.
Conversations continued between W and NatWest in March. On 7 March, NatWest said to 
W that it should never have been asked to complete an ownership structure chart. However, 
it again asked for a revised declaration of beneficial ownership to be uploaded onto its portal. 
NatWest said that it would prepare the form and email it to W for W to upload, but it appears 
that NatWest never sent this email.
W kept chasing NatWest to find out what had happened, speaking to people in both 
NatWests business profile team and its complaints team. On 15 March, W spoke with 
someone at NatWest who was able to guide W through the process to download the 
template for the declaration of beneficial ownership form, complete it and upload it to the 
portal. W believed that this was exactly as it had done on 25 February. NatWest 
acknowledged that the document had been uploaded successfully and confirmed that it 
would now apply to have the restrictions lifted.
On 17 March, W called NatWest to find out if everything was complete. NatWest confirmed 
that the documents had been accepted and verified. Later that day, the restrictions on Ws 
account were lifted.
W complained to NatWest. Overall, its account was restricted from 26 January until 17 
March  a period of 50 days. In this time, W conducted its business through a different bank. 
However, it says it suffered considerable cost and inconvenience in getting matters resolved. 
W says it was difficult to contact NatWest as there was no email address provided by the 
bank; and it says that every time it spoke to NatWest over the phone, it was given different 
information about what was required. Ws main criticism of NatWest was with regard to the 
inflexibility of its processes and the requirements of its portal. W accepts that NatWest 
required details of all material shareholders (whether direct or indirect shareholders), but the 
problem was that this information couldnt be provided to NatWest through its portal. W also 
said that much of the delay was caused by NatWests original mistake to presume that its 
shareholder was PUK (rather than PO), which had caused many unnecessary questions to 
be asked. 
NatWest said that it could not be held responsible for W being unaware that its shareholder 
was based overseas, or for that shareholder being unwilling to share information with W to 
pass on to NatWest. NatWest maintained that the restrictions were applied to Ws account 
on 26 January 2022 correctly, in line with its notifications and warnings to W. NatWest 
acknowledged that W had difficulties in uploading the required documents onto its portal, but 
said information to help W was available on its website, or W could have requested it earlier. 
NatWest said that a telephone appointment to help W with uploading the required documents could have been provided sooner but it was Ws responsibility to provide it with 
the information required.
Our investigator considered Ws complaint. He said that, although NatWest had made the 
initial error in uploading the wrong P onto Ws business profile, had this not been the case, 
W would still have faced the same problem of gaining the required information about PO. He 
said that it wasnt the responsibility of NatWest to contact PO to obtain the information, so he 
didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly in placing the restriction on Ws account as, at that 
time, the required information remained outstanding. However, he did say that, at the point in 
February 2022 when it became clear that PO was the shareholder in W and not PUK, 
NatWest should have done more to assist W in providing the required information onto its 
system, especially due to the technical issues W had experienced. Our investigator said that, 
for the inconvenience caused to W in having its account blocked for an unnecessarily long 
period, NatWest should pay W £250.
W did not agree and asked for an ombudsmans decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. NatWest accepted this provisional decision 
and W said that it did not wish to make any further representations. Therefore, my decision 
below is unchanged. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While I have read carefully the full correspondence between W and NatWest and considered 
all the evidence submitted, I have focussed my decision on the matters which I consider 
central to this complaint. I believe there are two key issues according to the different stages 
of the events set out above:
Did NatWest act reasonably in how it sought to obtain the required information from 
W and in applying the restrictions to Ws account in January 2022?
Did NatWest act reasonably in how it engaged with W after the restrictions were 
imposed to enable W to provide the information as quickly as possible so that the 
restrictions could be removed?
I consider each in turn.
August 2021 to January 2022
It is not in dispute that NatWest needed to obtain information from W as part of a business 
profile review in line with its regulatory obligations. Its requests appear reasonable. In 
NatWests letters, it set out clearly the information required, and explained the action it would 
take should this information not be provided. 
Between August 2021 and January 2022, it appears to me that NatWest engaged 
extensively with W, though it is apparent from the phone calls that the details of its requests 
were sometimes expressed in different terms and caused some confusion. It is also 
apparent that, although W sought to provide NatWest with the required information through 
its portal, it found this very difficult to navigate.However, the biggest confusion in this period was about the identity of P. Neither W nor 
NatWest appreciated that Ws shareholder P was a completely different entity (PO) from the 
entity which NatWest had recorded on Ws business profile (PUK). 
NatWest clearly made an error in entering PUK as a shareholder in W when it should have 
been PO. Although this mistake is understandable in the circumstances, it did cause 
confusion and, had the identify of Ws shareholder been identified earlier, it is likely that the 
precise information required by NatWest could have been clarified earlier and the problems 
resolved sooner.
However, I do not believe NatWest can be held solely responsible for not identifying this 
error earlier. It is primarily a matter for W to know the identity of its shareholders, including 
where they are based.
Part of the reason why the confusion over Ps identity continued for so long was because PO 
refused to provide the required information to W. Had it done so, the distinction to PUK 
would have immediately come to light. 
However, again, I do not believe I can hold NatWest responsible for this. While I 
acknowledge that PO did offer to engage directly with NatWest, I do not believe it was 
unreasonable for NatWest to ask W to provide the required information from its shareholder.
But it appears that NatWest didnt let W know that it couldnt get in touch with Ws 
shareholder directly until February 2022. Had it done so earlier, W might have spoken with 
PO earlier and NatWests error in entering PUK as Ws shareholder might have come to 
light. W might have been able to evidence sooner that there was no shareholder in PO with 
more than a 10% indirect stake in W.
Given that in January 2022 the process had been going on a long time, and given that 
NatWest hadnt been provided with the information it needed, I believe it is understandable 
that NatWest put in place the restrictions on Ws account. However, had NatWest not made 
the original error to identify the wrong company as Ws shareholder, or had it told W earlier 
that it couldnt contact Ws shareholder, the situation might have been different. 
January 2022 to March 2022
In February 2022, the identity of Ws shareholder P became clear and, although it still 
refused to supply the required information, it is apparent that sufficient information was 
available about PO such that NatWests requirements could be satisfied. On 16 February, W 
provided in a phone call to NatWest the information to explain that there was no shareholder 
in PO who would have indirectly a shareholding of more than 10% in W. This information 
was confirmed in writing through the portal on 25 February. This should have enabled 
matters to be resolved much sooner.
In my view, given no new information came to light between mid-February and mid-March, 
and given Ws continued pressing for matters to be resolved as quickly as possible so that 
the restrictions could be lifted, NatWest could have done more to progress things quicker.
It is apparent that W had made several attempts to upload information through NatWests 
portal without success, and that it required technical support from NatWest. It is also 
apparent that W was given conflicting information by NatWest in different calls, and at 
different points was encouraged to believe that the restrictions might be lifted, which they 
werent. In the call on 15 March, NatWest was able to help W provide the required information, such 
that the restrictions could be lifted two days later. In my view, this conversation could have 
happened much sooner. 
So, while I accept NatWest needed to clarify the ownership structure of W, and confirm the 
information provided, and while I accept it needed to schedule technical support for W, I 
believe there were delays in this period which could have been avoided. These delays 
caused W to suffer ongoing cost and inconvenience from the restrictions being in place for 
longer than was necessary.
How to put things right
W has said that, although the restrictions on its account caused considerable inconvenience, 
it was able to continue trading through use of an account with another bank. Therefore, there 
is no basis for compensating W for any detriment to its trade. 
However, the directors of W did spend a lot of time dealing with NatWest. Some of this 
inconvenience was unavoidable as the checks were necessary; and, as set out above, both 
parties bear some responsibility for the confusion over Ws shareholder. However, NatWest 
did make a mistake in identifying the wrong shareholder for W, it could have informed W 
earlier about its inability to contact Ws shareholder, and it could have done more to progress 
matters once the confusion had been resolved. 
In determining appropriate levels of compensation to put things right, our service doesnt 
quantify inconvenience on an hourly rate but looks at everything in the round. I acknowledge 
that W has paid its director for each day its account was blocked in recognition of his time to 
resolve matters. However, while I recognise this cost to W, I do not believe this amount 
would be consistent with the awards typically made by our service for the inconvenience 
caused. Rather, I believe NatWest should pay W £750.
I also acknowledge that the directors of W will have suffered considerable stress through 
resolving these matters. However, the complainant in this case is W and, as a company, W 
is unable to feel distress. Therefore, I am unable to award anything for this. 
I appreciate that Mr B will feel that this amount is inadequate to put right NatWests mistakes 
but, for the reasons set out above, I believe it is consistent with our principles for awarding 
compensation in such circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and require National Westminster Bank Plc 
to pay W £750.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask W to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2023.
