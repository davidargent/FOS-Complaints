K820x#14complaint
Miss D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent Miss D and NatWest a provisional  decision on 17 July 2019 to explain  why I wasnt  
intending to uphold the complaint. An extract from my provisional  decision is set out below:
When deciding whether  to lend to a customer,  a business must carry out an assessment of 
the customers ability to repay what they are borrowing. Theres no set list of checks that 
must be carried out, but the checks a business  does must  be proportionate when considered 
against the size of the loan, the loan repayments  or any other information the business has 
about the consumer.
From the information NatWest has sent us, I can see that it asked  Miss D for details about  
her income, her outgoings  and her outstanding debts with other  lenders  during the 
application for the loan. I can also see that NatWest  asked Miss D for several months of 
salary slips in order  to check  her income  was correct, which it was.
The record  on NatWests system also shows that the application  was scored against credit 
information about Miss D held by credit reference agencies.  And that Miss Ds application 
passed this check.
NatWest also has copies  of some credit card statements from Miss D, which it says 
suggests Miss D told it she would be paying off these debts with some  of the funds from the 
loan. And, while  these statements show the credit  cards were over their agreed limits, they 
werent over by a significant amount and had only become so recently.
So it appears that NatWest asked for information on Miss Ds income  and outgoings, got 
proof of her income and scored  her application against information on her credit  file. Given  
the amount of the loan and what Miss Ds monthly  repayments would be, I think  these 
checks were proportionate. And I think NatWests decision to accept the loan was 
reasonable, based on the information it received. So I think NatWest treated Miss D 
reasonably when assessing whether the loan was affordable  for her.
Miss D also raised that her credit file was poor at the time, and says this shows  NatWest  
didnt look into her circumstances properly. Shes  sent us a copy of her credit  file, as well as 
statements for other current accounts  she had, which show a number  of short-term, high-
cost loans and a number of online gambling transactions. Miss D said that, if NatWest had 
looked into her circumstances properly, it wouldnt have agreed to lend to her.
I explained above that NatWest did check information on Miss Ds credit file, and that I feel 
NatWest did carry out proportionate checks into Miss Ds circumstances and whether she 
could afford  to repay the loan.
And, from the copy of Miss Ds credit file that Ive seen, Im not satisfied that it showed 
anything which would  have suggested  she was particularly vulnerable or that NatWest would 
be acting irresponsibly by lending  to her.
I can see Miss D had taken out a number of short-term, high-cost loans in the months before 
her loan application. But I dont think the number of loans, or the amounts of them, was 
Ref: DRN86273782enough by itself to stop NatWest lending to her. The information on her credit file shows that 
these loans were repaid  on time,  with no missed  payments. And Miss Ds accounts were 
overdrawn in the months  before the loan application,  but it appears they stayed within  
agreed overdraft limits.
Theres also no significant adverse information in relation to any other  accounts on Miss Ds 
credit file that wouldve been showing when  NatWest was assessing  her circumstances.
While Miss Ds current account statements  show a number  of gambling transactions, I 
wouldnt expect NatWest  to refuse  a loan application  just because a customer  spent money 
on gambling. Ive not seen anything to suggest NatWest was made aware Miss Ds gambling 
was a problem  for her during  the application. And, as her accounts appear  to have been 
either in credit or within  agreed  overdraft  limits for the months before the application, I dont 
think theres clear enough evidence that NatWest should have been aware that her gambling 
was a problem  or meant that lending  to her would be irresponsible.
So I dont  think NatWest  acted irresponsibly in agreeing to the loan.
From NatWests records, I can also see both earlier and later loan applications Miss D made 
were either turned down or not completed after further information  was requested by 
NatWest. And I think this suggests NatWest was trying to make a reasonable assessment of 
whether Miss D could  afford the loans and to lend responsibly.
NatWest has also sent us statements showing Miss Ds repayments  on the loan. And these  
show that Miss D was able to make all her required monthly repayments  until February 
2017. NatWests  contact notes also show that Miss D called it in February 2017 and said she 
had changed jobs and so now had a lower salary. This suggests the loan was initially  
affordable for Miss D and her gambling didnt affect  her ability to repay it, and that it was a 
change in her circumstances that led to the loan being  unaffordable.
While I think NatWest carried out reasonable checks when assessing whether Miss D could 
afford the loan and I dont think it lent to her irresponsibly, if it hasnt done so already, I would 
expect NatWest to treat Miss D positively and sympathetically in response  to any ongoing 
debts or financial difficulty.
I said Id consider anything further Miss D and NatWest sent in.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Ds case.
NatWest said it didnt  have anything further to add following my provisional decision.
Miss D said she disagreed with the decision and that she couldnt afford the loan. But she 
didnt send us anything further  to show that she couldnt afford  it. I explained in my 
provisional decision that I felt NatWest  had carried out proportionate checks  and then made 
a reasonable decision  based  on the information it had, when assessing whether she could 
afford the loan. And I still think this is the case,  for the same  reasons.
Ref: DRN86273783Miss D also said NatWest  never  asked to see her other accounts and suggested that her 
gambling problem  should have stopped NatWest lending to her. But I explained in my 
provisional decision that I didnt think the evidence Id seen of her circumstances  at the time 
was enough to show that NatWest should  have been aware  her gambling was a problem  or 
meant that lending to her would be irresponsible. And, as Miss D hasnt sent us anything  
further about her circumstances at the time, I still think this is correct,  for the same reasons.
So I still think the conclusions I set out in my provisional decision are correct and I dont think  
this complaint should be upheld.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Miss Ds complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October  2019.
