The complaint
Mr N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account and lodged markers 
with the credit reference agencies.
What happened
Mr N held an account with NatWest and received notice that his account was to be closed 
within 14 days. Mr N wasnt given a reason for the closure and complained to NatWest about 
it. He believed NatWest had lodged markers with credit reference agencies preventing him 
from opening other bank accounts.
NatWest investigated Mr Ns complaint and declined to explain why theyd closed his 
account and referred to their terms and conditions allowing them to do this. They did confirm 
that they hadnt lodged any markers with external agencies and advised Mr N to contact the 
credit reference agencies and CIFAS  a fraud prevention service.
Mr N remained unhappy with how his complaint was dealt with and brought it to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service for an independent review. Mr Ns complaint was looked into by one of 
our investigators who reviewed the information provided by Mr N and NatWest.
Our investigator thought it was reasonable for NatWest to rely on their terms and conditions 
and close the account without providing Mr N with any further explanation. Mr N disagreed 
with the investigators outcome and asked for a further review of his complaint by an 
Ombudsman. Mr Ns complaint has now been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The account opened by Mr N was subject to relevant terms and conditions that govern how it 
should be operated. It sets out the responsibilities of both parties and the options for closing 
the account.
Such closures can be actioned by either party. Mr N can decide not to continue with it and 
close it. NatWest also have the option of closing it and the terms set out how they can do 
this.
NatWest have relied on a section of the terms which were set out in NatWests final 
response letter and the investigators view, so I dont need to repeat them here. In summary 
they say under certain circumstances, NatWest can close the account immediately. NatWest 
interpreted this with a notice to close the account within 14 days. NatWest have no obligation 
to disclose the reasons for doing so. 
Ive reviewed the information related to NatWests decision and Im satisfied they complied 
with their terms. I realise Mr N will be disappointed that hes not going to receive further 
information about the account closure, but I hope he can draw some confidence that his 
complaint has been independently considered.
Mr N believed NatWest had lodged markers with external agencies. Having reviewed the 
evidence and NatWests submissions, theres no evidence that NatWest communicated the 
account closure with external agencies. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2022.
