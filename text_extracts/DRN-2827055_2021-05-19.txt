The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt capitalise his arrears when it 
extended the term of his mortgage. He also says it didnt contact him about his arrears after 
this. Mr J asks that NatWest removes information about the arrears from his credit files. 
What happened
Mr J took out a buy to let mortgage with NatWest in 2017. The mortgage fell into arrears. In 
February 2020 he agreed a term extension with NatWest. Mr J says he was told this would 
clear his arrears. He says he wasnt contacted about his arrears after this.
Our investigator said NatWest hadnt agreed to capitalise the arrears. It told him hed need to 
contact it again to discuss this. Our investigator said NatWest had reported correct 
information about the arrears to the credit reference agencies. She said NatWest wasnt 
wrong to send paperwork to the mortgage address as Mr J hadnt given it a different 
address. 
Mr J said the investigator had looked at information on the wrong account (he has two 
mortgages with NatWest).
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the investigators view Mr J said the evidence shed relied on related to his 
other mortgage account with NatWest. I can assure Mr J that Ive carefully checked the 
account number when reading documents to ensure it relates to the right account. I should 
also explain that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my 
decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to 
have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Mr J took out a buy to let mortgage with NatWest in 2017. Broadly, Mr Js complaints are: 
that NatWest didnt treat him fairly when he had financial difficulties in mid-2019.
in early 2020 it agreed to capitalise arrears, but didnt do so. 
NatWest didnt tell him arrears remained outstanding. 
NatWest was unfair to record the arrears on his credit file.
What happened in 2019?
Mr J contacted NatWest in mid-2019 as he wasnt in regular employment. He said the 
security property was on the market for sale and he needed a couple of months help while 
he tried to sell it. He said he was due to start a new job in September. 
NatWest said it couldnt consider capitalising arrears or a term extension at that time due to 
Mr Js income and expenditure. NatWest agreed a payment deferral, which it said was the 
most appropriate option. In the circumstances, I think this was fair. Mr J was unable to make 
payments and intended to sell the property. A payment deferral gave him some time to 
progress the sale of the property.
What happened in early 2020?
In early 2020 Mr J contacted NatWest. He said he was starting a new job and wanted to get 
the mortgage account up to date. The arrears were about Â£6,000. 
Mr J said the property was on the market for sale and this would clear the mortgage balance 
and arrears. NatWest said it wouldnt usually offer concessions when the security property is 
for sale. It said while the property was being marketed, Mr J needed to commit to an 
arrangement so that it could hold recovery action. 
Mr J said hed have difficulty meeting payments from his employment income. He didnt want 
to let the property as he was selling it. There was a discussion about what options were 
available, and a term extension or capitalisation were discussed. NatWest agreed to extend 
the term. This reduced Mr Js contractual monthly payments. I think this was fair. It reduced 
Mr Js monthly payments to what appeared to be a manageable amount while he progressed 
the sale of the property. 
NatWest says it didnt agree to capitalise Mr Js arrears, and the evidence it provided 
supports this. 
Did NatWest inform Mr J about the arrears?
NatWest sent a variation agreement for the term extension. NatWest received the signed 
acceptance from Mr J and sent a confirmation letter on 6 March. Mr J says he received the 
letter dated 6 March 2020 confirming the new mortgage agreement. Mr J says this letter 
didnt mention arrears, and so he thought the arrears had been added to the mortgage 
balance.
NatWest says it sent a quarterly arrears statement to Mr J in March 2020. And it tried to call 
Mr J in April. Mr J says he didnt receive any communication (letters or calls) about the 
arrears until mid-2020, when he contacted NatWest about another matter. 
NatWest says by mid-2020 it had three different addresses for Mr J. His address has since 
been updated and NatWest cant confirm what address it had for this mortgage account at 
that time. From its notes, it seems it needed Mr J to go to a branch with identification 
documents to update his address. However, Mr J did receive the variation agreement and 
confirmation letter in March 2020. And in June 2020 a mortgage statement was sent to the 
address Mr J had given to NatWest in February 2020. So, on balance, I think its likely 
NatWest wrote to Mr J at this address between February and June 2020. Im sorry that Mr J 
didnt receive the letter about the arrears, but I dont think I can fairly say this was due to an 
error by NatWest.
Mr J was in contact with NatWest in March and April 2020 about getting consent for a 
second charge on the property. NatWest says hed told their debt management team the 
funds would be used to pay the arrears. This suggests Mr J was aware of the arrears. 
Ultimately though, I dont think it makes any difference to the outcome here whether Mr J 
knew the arrears remained outstanding. Hed told NatWest in February 2020 his 
circumstances meant he was unable to make his mortgage payments. Mr J asked for a 
three-month payment deferral in April 2020 (related to Covid-19). It seems unlikely Mr J was 
in a position to repay the arrears.Mr J says when he found out the arrears hadnt been dealt with as he expected, he called 
NatWest. While Mr J says the line cut off just as NatWest agreed to add arrears to the 
mortgage balance, the evidence from NatWest doesnt support this. NatWests notes say it 
was taking income and expenditure information to consider a repayment plan. 
Was it fair for NatWest to record arrears on Mr Js credit files?
The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) issued principles for the reporting of arrears to 
credit reference agencies. This requires lenders to report data that is fair, accurate, 
consistent, complete and up to date. Lenders have to report missed payments and arrears. 
ICO says the purpose of reporting arrears is to indicate at the earliest opportunity that a 
customer is showing signs of potential financial difficulty.
Mr Js account was in arrears due to financial difficulties. I think it was fair for NatWest to 
report the arrears.
Overall, I dont think NatWest treated Mr J unfairly. It follows that I dont uphold this 
complaint.
Mr J has raised a further issue about a payment deferral in 2020, related to the Covid-19 
pandemic. As this wasnt part of the complaint raised with NatWest and brought to us, I cant 
consider it here.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2021.
