The complaint
Miss W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) couldnt find an account 
she held.
What happened
Miss W says she had an account with NatWest, but lost track of it. She said it had a balance 
of Â£9,800. Miss W had suffered with various illnesses and accidents over the years and 
needs the money to live off. She wants the money returned to her, plus compensation.
NatWest attempted to trace the account a number of times and wrote to Miss W in 2005, 
2010, 2018 and lastly in July 2019. The letters then said they couldnt find any account in 
Miss Ws name. 
NatWests last final response (in February 2023) said they couldnt find any account held in 
Miss Ws name. Theyd asked her for further evidence, such as old statements, passbook, 
correspondence, but Miss W couldnt provide anything. So NatWest declined Miss Ws 
complaint. 
Miss W brought her complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. She could see that 
NatWest searched their records for an account in Miss Ws name, but without any success. 
She said NatWest had done all they could.
Miss W asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint and so it has come to me to make a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been through Miss Ws contacts with NatWest and see that the bank investigated this for 
her several times  in 2005, 2010, 2018 and 2019. Therefore, under normal circumstances, 
our rules would say that we cannot look into Miss Ws complaint again - as it has already 
been investigated. For us to be able to look into it, we would need NatWests agreement  
we asked for that and they agreed.
Looking back at what happened, I can see that NatWest searched their records each time on 
the dates Ive set out and found nothing. And then searched again and wrote to Miss W in 
February 2023. Ive seen the searches they did on her name and date of birth/address. And 
nothing is shown. 
I can only look at whether NatWest acted reasonably in dealing with Miss Ws complaint. 
And they have  I can see theyve searched for Miss Ws address recently again (in June 
2023). And couldnt find anything. 
Miss W gave us a number of other addresses she lived at over the years. I wanted to ensure 
these had been looked at  and we asked NatWest to do that. NatWest searched again on 
those further four addresses  and found nothing. We asked (as did NatWest) Miss W for 
any evidence she still had about the account  such as old cheque book stubs, statements, 
letters etc, as that may have helped. But unfortunately she couldnt provide anything.
I was sorry to learn of the difficulties that Miss W has had over the years, and I hope she is 
now keeping as well as can be expected. I know she will be disappointed, but my decision is 
that NatWest dealt with her complaint effectively, and I am not asking the bank to do 
anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 September 2023.
