The complaint
Mr S is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have sent him letters in the post 
in relation to his accounts with them, even though he requested that he should not be sent 
any post. 
What happened
Mr S raised his concerns with NatWest and they reviewed what had happened for him. On 
21 October 2021 NatWest explained they couldnt see that anything had been posted to Mr 
S about his accounts, but invited Mr S to share any other evidence he might have. 
Mr S provided evidence to NatWest that a letter had been sent to him, so NatWest 
investigated things further. On 28 October 2021, NatWest apologised that it seemed an error 
had been made when Mr Ss e-mail address had been keyed into their system. As 
NatWests systems had therefore not been able to recognise the e-mail address, 
unfortunately a letter was issued to Mr S in error. 
NatWest apologised for the error and to recognise that they shouldve picked this up sooner 
and corrected things earlier they offered Mr S £200, which he did not accept. NatWest also 
offered Mr S reassurance that this was an error and there was no intention to discriminate 
against him or ignore the reasonable adjustment hed requested.
Unfortunately during the complaints process a further letter was posted to Mr S and he 
raised his concern again with NatWest. NatWest reviewed things further and confirmed the 
error with Mr Ss e-mail address had been fixed before the letter in question was issued  
although NatWest did note given the letter had come from the complaints department the 
error with the e-mail address would not have prevented the letter from being posted. This 
was because NatWest found it had been posted due to human error. 
NatWest offered further apologies to Mr S and additional reassurances that all reasonable 
steps had been put in place to stop post going to Mr S in the future; although, NatWest also 
noted it was not possible to offer Mr S any guarantees. To recognise the overall upset 
caused to Mr S, NatWest offered him £750. 
NatWests call note from 21 December 2021 recorded Mr S had chosen to accept the offer 
as he couldnt afford to take NatWest through the legal route. The payment of £750 was 
made directly into Mr Ss account on the same day. 
Mr S brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator explained we could not say if a 
law had been breached (that is something for the courts to decide). And they explained that 
while they were aware of Mr Ss previous complaints about NatWest, their focus would be on 
this matter only. 
Our investigator noted the errors NatWest had made with regards to recording Mr Ss e-mail 
address incorrectly and that it was human error which had caused the later letter to be 
posted to Mr S. Our investigator said the offer of £750 was fair in the circumstances and they 
said NatWest had taken reasonable steps to try and stop this from happening again. So our 
investigator said there was nothing else NatWest needed to do to put things right. 
Mr S didnt accept the investigators conclusions and so the matter has come to me to 
decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am aware of the previous complaints Mr S has brought to our service about NatWest, and 
as our investigator explained, this decision will only deal with the matter in this complaint. So 
I will not comment on or consider anything relating to Mr Ss other complaints about 
NatWest. 
While I can, amongst other things, take the law into account in my considerations, as our 
investigator explained, it is not for our service to decide if a law has been breached  that is 
something for the courts to decide. So to decide if NatWest has breached the Equality Act 
2010, would be stepping outside of my powers. Our role is to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of the individual case. 
Mr S asked NatWest to make a reasonable adjustment for him, and I dont think it was 
unreasonable for him to expect that this adjustment would be put in place. So I can see why, 
when Mr S received post at home, this would have caused him unnecessary upset. 
Ive seen NatWests submissions explaining what they found when they investigated Mr Ss 
concerns, and what theyve done to try and prevent the error of sending out post from 
happening again. 
It is disappointing that Mr Ss e-mail address appears to have been updated incorrectly and 
that human error caused further post to be issued to Mr Ss address. However, from what 
Ive seen I dont think NatWest intentionally tried to cause Mr S difficulties or unnecessary 
upset  that is, I dont think there was a deliberate intent to ignore Mr Ss reasonable 
adjustment. 
That said, the errors did occur and I can see NatWest has recognised they could have 
managed things better for Mr S. 
From the available evidence, I think NatWest appears to have taken reasonable steps to 
stop post being sent to Mr S. Their systems show special instructions on Mr Ss records to 
not send out post and use electronic communications only, and Ive seen from a screenshot 
that Mr S is not to receive any marketing correspondence. His statements are also set to be 
issued to him electronically. 
NatWest have placed markers and warnings on their systems to prevent Mr S from receiving 
any further post, and I think what theyve done appears reasonable. Im mindful that NatWest 
can offer no guarantees to Mr S that this may not happen again  human nature is not within 
NatWests control. However I can see NatWest provided feedback to those involved in this 
matter to help their staff learn from this and provide a better service going forward. In the 
circumstances I think this was a reasonable and sensible thing for NatWest to do. 
I realise this matter has caused Mr S much frustration and unnecessary upset, and Im 
aware Mr S was looking for a higher sum of compensation to reflect this. Ive carefully considered this, but overall I think the award of £750 that NatWest have offered to resolve 
things is fair in the circumstances of the case. 
Deciding a level of fair compensation in such cases is not easy  it is not an exact science to 
understand the impact an event has had on someone. Im also aware that no amount of 
compensation can now change whats already happened. While I realise Mr S is looking for 
a higher sum, overall I do feel the sum offered is fair in this case, so Im not going to ask 
NatWest to do any more. It might help Mr S to note that it is not for this service to fine or 
punish firms  that is the role of the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Mr S may not accept my view of things, but I hope I have been able to offer him some 
reassurance that I think the measures NatWest have put in place should help prevent this 
issue from happening again. Of course, if Mr S experiences any further problems with 
receiving post, then he can let NatWest know for them to investigate and resolve any issues 
where it would be appropriate for them to do so. 
 
My final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
