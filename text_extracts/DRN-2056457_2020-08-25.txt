The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that NatWest Bank PLC wasnt clear about the terms of a special offer 
linked to his life cover. When Mr H took the policy out in 2004, he believed he would receive 
25% cashback on all the premiums hed paid for the 15 years his policy was in place. 
NatWest accepted the offer was poorly worded, but it said the offer only applied to the 
premiums paid in the first 12 months. It apologised to Mr H and gave him a £20 gift voucher. 
Mr H wants NatWest to pay him 25% of all the premiums paid under his policy. 
What happened
Our investigator felt the complaint shouldnt be upheld. He accepted NatWest couldve made 
the terms of the offer clearer. But he didnt think NatWest misled Mr H into thinking hed get 
cashback on all the premiums paid over the term of his policy. Our investigator said 
NatWests apology and £20 voucher was a fair remedy. 
Mr H disagreed and has asked an Ombudsman to review his complaint. He maintained 
NatWest should give him 25% cashback on all the premiums paid, given it accepts the offer 
was poorly worded. And Mr H said hes been financially disadvantaged because he only 
bought the policy from NatWest on the understanding hed get back 25% of all the premiums 
paid. So, he felt the policy had been mis-sold to him. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator. And for largely the 
same reasons. I know Mr H feels strongly about this complaint and this will come as a 
disappointment to him, so Ill explain why.
Ive read and considered the whole file. But Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont mention any specific point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board 
and think about it, but because I dont think I need to comment on it to reach what I think is 
the right outcome.
I should also explain that my review hasnt considered Mr Hs concerns that NatWest mis-
sold him the policy. Ive only looked at the wording of the offer and whether NatWest has 
acted fairly. If Mr H wants to complain about the policy being mis-sold, then he would need 
to raise that with NatWest first. He could then refer the complaint to our service if hes 
unhappy with NatWests response. 
NatWest wrote to Mr H in 2004 and said:
By taking out this policy now, you have also qualified for the following special 
offer(s).25% Cash Back (to be eligible for the 25% Cash Back your policy must have been in 
force and premiums paid for 12 consecutive months). 
..
I can understand how Mr H couldve taken this to mean he would get cashback on all the 
premiums paid. So, Im pleased NatWest has accepted the wording isnt clear and 
apologised to Mr H. And that Mr H has been paid cashback on his first 
12 months' premiums, in line with the terms of the offer. 
But I dont agree that NatWest should pay Mr H any more. Whilst the above wording isnt 
clear the cashback only applies to the first 12 months, it doesnt confirm cashback on all the 
premiums would be paid. And I can see from the application form completed by Mr H that 
further information about the offer provides an example of what the cashback would be, 
based on a monthly premium of £15 (£40.50). Mr H was paying a monthly premium of
£18.09.
On balance, I dont believe NatWest misled Mr H into thinking hed get cashback on all the 
premiums hed paid. So, I think NatWests apology and £20 voucher for Mr H is a fair and 
reasonable outcome to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2020.
