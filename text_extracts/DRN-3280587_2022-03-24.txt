The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount that hes been charged by Moneybarn No. 1 Limited after 
he voluntarily terminated the conditional sale agreement under which a car had been 
supplied to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr S under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that he 
electronically signed in October 2020. He voluntarily terminated the agreement in November 
2021 and he owed Moneybarn a shortfall of £2,327.03. The car was collected from him by a 
third party on behalf of Moneybarn and a vehicle collection receipt was completed which 
identified that the spare key, MOT certificate and service history were missing, all four 
wheels were damaged and there was an issue with the bumper. 
The car was inspected two days later by another third party on behalf of Moneybarn and 
further damage to the car was identified in a vehicle condition report with an estimated repair 
cost of £3,172.88. Moneybarn says that it had valued the car at £3,064.25 but it sold at 
auction for £2,200  a difference of £864.25 which it charged to Mr S in addition to the 
£2,327.03 that he owed to it. Mr S complained to it that hed been told that hed owe nothing 
further for the car. He wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mr S had accepted the voluntary termination shortfall of £2,327.03, she wasnt persuaded 
that the damage to the car was fair wear and tear and she thought that Moneybarn had 
acted fairly in charging him for the difference between the valuation and the sale price at 
auction. She said that she expected it to act positively and sympathetically towards Mr Ss 
financial situation and allow him to set up a payment plan.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that 
Moneybarn has been allowed to drag this out for several months but he tried to return the 
car and was told to take a break from payments which caused the arrears. He says that hes 
not had any repairs made to the cars wing so the damage was from before the car was 
supplied to him. He also says that the difference between the vehicle collection receipt and 
the vehicle condition report wouldnt have been missed and the damage happened after the 
car was collected from him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr S has described the events which led to his financial difficulties and his need to 
return the car  and he has my deepest sympathy for what hes experienced and the 
situation in which he now finds himself;
the car had been supplied to him in October 2017 and, although hed missed some 
monthly payments, he made most of the monthly payments that were due between 
then and July 2019  when the last payment to his account was made  and 
Moneybarns account notes show that his account was £63.82 in arrears;
those account notes show that Mr S explained his situation to Moneybarn in October 
2019 and it sent him a letter in November 2019 about his options for ending his 
agreement  which included a voluntary termination;
Mr Ss right to end the agreement early was set out in the agreement which said that 
he would be entitled to return the car and to pay half the total amount payable under 
the agreement (which was specified as being £7,854.67);
the letter that was sent to him said that he could return the car and needed to pay a 
residual amount of £2,327.03 as he hadnt paid half the agreement value  it also 
said the amount that he owed it could be significantly higher if the car wasnt returned 
in a reasonable condition;
Moneybarns account notes show that Mr S gave it notice of termination of the above 
agreement but said that the cars MOT test certificate had expired and a collection of 
the car from him was arranged;
the collection took place later that month and a vehicle collection receipt was 
prepared which identified that the spare key, MOT certificate and service history were 
missing, all four wheels were damaged and there was an issue with the bumper and 
recorded the cars mileage as 135,374 miles;
the agreement said: You must maintain (at your expense) the goods in good order 
and condition and will be responsible for any loss or damage to the goods, except fair 
wear and tear;
the car was inspected two days later and further damage to the car was identified  
the vehicle condition report that was prepared recorded the cars mileage as 135,374 
miles, described significant damage to the car with an estimated repair cost of 
£3,172.88 (which included damage to the bonnet, bumpers, windscreen, two wings, 
the tailgate, all four door and wheels, two quarter panels, a seat cover and the 
carpet) and included photos of that damage;
I consider it to be clear from the photos and the descriptions of the damage that the 
car had significant damage when it was returned and I consider that the damage was 
more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear  even for a car 
of this age and mileage  and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for 
Moneybarn to charge Mr S for some of that damage;
the cars mileage when it was collected from Mr S was 135,374 miles and it had the 
same mileage two days later when it was inspected - the car didnt have a valid MOT 
certificate when it was collected from Mr S so I consider it to be unlikely that the car 
would have been driven by the third party that collected it or the third party that 
inspected it;
Im not persuaded that its likely that the damage was present when the car was 
supplied to Mr S and I consider it to be more likely than not that the damage was 
present when the car was collected from Mr S;
Moneybarn says that it had valued the car at £3,064.25 but it was sold at auction for 
£2,200 (a difference of £864.25) and it charged that amount to Mr S for the loss in 
value of the car rather than the cost of repairing the damage  I consider that to have 
been consistent with the conditional sale agreement and the letter that it had sent to 
Mr S in November 2019 and that it was fair and reasonable for it to charge him that 
amount;that was in addition to the £2,327.03 that Mr S owed it for the shortfall on his 
voluntary termination of the agreement and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to reduce or waive those charges in these 
circumstances;
there has been a delay in Moneybarn dealing with Mr Ss complaint and that has 
clearly caused him distress and inconvenience  but that delay hasnt increased the 
amount that Mr S owes to it  which has remained as £3,191.28 and Im not 
persuaded that an award of compensation to Mr S is justified in these circumstances; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to reduce or 
waive the charges that its made to Mr S, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr S contacts Moneybarn to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that he owes to it. If he doesnt do so I consider it to be likely 
that it will take further action against him, to the extent that its legally entitled to do so, to 
recover that amount from him  but Moneybarn is required to respond to any financial 
difficulties that Mr S is experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
