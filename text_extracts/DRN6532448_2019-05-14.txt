Mr B complains that loans  he had from MEM Consumer Finance Limited (trading as Payday  
UK) were unaffordable.
background
Mr B had eight loans from Payday UK between October 2011 and March 2014  as follows:
Loan Date Amount Due Repayment Repaid
1 28 Oct 2011 £100 30 Nov 2011 £125 On time
2 15 Jan 2012 £250 31 Jan 2012 £312.50 Deferred - 29 Feb 2012 
3 2 May 2013 £250 31 May 2013 £312.50 On time
4 16 Jul 2013 £350 31 Jul 2013 £437.50 Deferred  30 Aug 2013
5 13 Sep 2013 £700 30 Sep 2013 £875 Cancelled  16 Sep 2013
6 25 Nov 2013 £400 31 Dec 2013 £500 Deferred  31 Jan 2014
7 20 Feb 2014 £100 27 Feb 2014 £129.95 On time
8 15 Mar 2014 £300 27 Mar 2014 £389.85 26 Oct 2017
Mr B says the loans  werent affordable based  on his income and expenditure. He says his 
financial history should have indicated to Payday UK that he was not creditworthy.
Payday UK says it asked Mr B for information about his income and expenditure and 
checked his credit file. It says the loans were  affordable, it found Mr B to be creditworthy and 
it did not believe he was reliant on the borrowing.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied that 
Payday UK did enough checks before approving  the first loan, but didnt think  the checks  
went far enough for the remaining loans. Our adjudicator considered Payday UK should 
have asked Mr B about his expenditure before  it approved loans 2, 3 and 4. As Mr B hadnt 
provided any evidence  of his financial circumstance at the time of loan 2, our adjudicator 
was unable to say what such a check would have  shown. But he said it was reasonable to 
assume Mr B would have  declared expenditure that was similar  to what  he declared for loan 
5 had he been asked about his expenditure for loans  3 and 4. He found that loans  3 and 4 
would have been affordable on that basis. Our adjudicator did not consider  loan 5 as it was 
cancelled with no interest charged.
Because of Mr Bs borrowing pattern, our adjudicator said Payday UK should  have carried  
out a detailed assessment of his financial circumstances  before it approved loans 6, 7 and 8. 
But, as Mr B hadnt provided any evidence of his circumstances at the time, our adjudicator 
was unable to say what such a review would  have shown and, therefore, could not 
recommend the complaints about these loans should be upheld.
Mr B responded to say, in summary, that the complaint should be upheld  because Payday 
UK didnt  carry out enough checks.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B 
and to Payday  UK on 10 April 2019. I summarise my findings:
Ref: DRN65324482For loans 1 and 2, I found the repayments were a small proportion  of Mr Bs declared 
income and there was nothing  in the information  available to Payday UK that should  
have prompted  it to decline the applications.
Loans 3 and 4 were  taken out after a gap in borrowing of over a year so I was 
satisfied it was reasonable for Payday UK to consider the loans as a new chain. As 
the repayments were  not a significant  proportion of Mr Bs income, I didnt find 
Payday UK was wrong  to approve them.
As loan 5 was cancelled, with no interest paid,  I didnt  consider it further.
It was almost three months after Mr B repaid loan 4 that he applied for loan 6 and 
with the exception of one deferral  on loan 4, he had a good repayment  history. As his 
scheduled repayment wasnt a very large proportion  of his income. I didnt see there 
was anything in the information available to Payday UK that should have suggested 
the borrowing  was unsustainable at this point.
When Mr B applied  for loan 7, the requested amount was a lot lower than previous 
loans. I considered it reasonable for Payday UK to assume Mr B was bringing his 
short-term lending  requirements under control and approve the loan on that basis.
But by the time Mr B applied for loan 8 his borrowing had increased again so he 
wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Payday UK. Loan 8 was 
taken out ten months after Mr Bs first in the loan chain. And it was for a larger  
amount. Mr B had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
Payday UK over an extended period.
I was satisfied, therefore, that loan 8 was the point at which  Payday UK should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable.
My provisional decision was that Payday  UK should  refund interest and charges on loan 8 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and removed all entries  about loan 8 from Mr Bs credit file.
Payday UK accepted my provisional decision.
Mr B responded to say that he needed  to continually borrow  from Payday UK in order  to 
maintain payments on other accounts.  He says he was precluded from obtaining credit 
elsewhere due to his reliance on short-term lending and the effect  it had on his credit rating.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept what Mr B says in response to my provisional decision, but I need to consider when 
it was reasonable  for Payday UK to realise the borrowing was unsustainable. As there  were  
gaps between each  of Mr Bs loans and loans 5 to 7 were reducing,  I dont think this would 
necessarily have indicated Mr B was reliant on the lending. Indeed,  his pattern of borrowing 
suggested Mr B may have  been bringing his short-term lending requirements  under control.
However, when Mr Bs application for loan 8 was three times as much  as loan 7, I consider 
this should have indicated to Payday UK that Mr Bs financial position was not improving  
and, based on his borrowing history, it should have seen he was not using the loans as 
short-term remedies. Instead, by continuing  to offer Mr B loans, Payday UK caused him to 
have to pay short-term  interest rates on loans that had spanned over ten months by loan 8.
But I cant conclude that Payday UK was wrong  to approve any of the earlier  loans for the 
reasons stated above. So I see no reason to depart  from my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN65324483my final decision
My decision  is that the complaint should  be upheld in part. MEM  Consumer Finance Limited 
(trading as Payday  UK) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr B paid on loan 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove all entries about loan 8 from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Payday UK to take off tax from this interest. Payday UK 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 June  2019.
