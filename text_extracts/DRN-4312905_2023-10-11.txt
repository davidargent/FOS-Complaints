The complaint
Mrs A complains that PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) wont refund £300 she says 
wasnt dispensed by an ATM.
What happened
The circumstances of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them
all again here in detail. But I will provide an overview of events below.
On 5 January 2023 at 15.54, Mrs A attempted to withdraw £300 from an ATM. Mrs A got a 
receipt for the transaction, and it showed on her statement, but she said the cash wasnt 
dispensed. Mrs A first raised the dispute with PrePay at 16.11 on 5 January 2023. 
On 13 January 2023 PrePay raised a chargeback. On 23 February 2023 it told Mrs A the 
chargeback had failed. PrePay said:
the chargeback was rejected by our card issuer because the ATM operator was able 
to confirm that the funds were dispensed from the ATM. 
Unhappy with this response, Mrs A referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman.
One of our Investigators considered the complaint and upheld it. He concluded that PrePay
shouldve requested further information from the ATM provider  such as the purge bin 
report, evidence the ATM balanced and whether it had been tampered with. Our Investigator 
said without this, he couldnt conclude, on balance, whether the £300 had been dispensed 
from the ATM. For these reasons, he asked PrePay to refund Mrs A £300 with 8% interest.
Mrs A accepted our Investigators findings but PrePay didnt so the case has been passed to 
me to decide.
In short, PrePay said it didnt have access to the information our Investigator had asked for, 
as it didnt own the ATM used by Mrs A. It said it had contacted the ATM provider  but 
hadnt heard back. But in any event, PrePay said the information provided by way of the 
chargeback process was enough to show the funds were dispensed. 
PrePay added that as part of the chargeback process  the key piece of evidence is the 
journal role  which it said it had provided to our Investigator. PrePay said the other 
evidence our Investigator asked for wasnt required as part of the chargeback process to 
prove the funds had been dispensed  and wasnt an industry standard requirement for 
resolving ATM disputes. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our Investigator  and for largely the 
same reasons.  
Its for PrePay to evidence the transaction Mrs A made was processed correctly. And when 
applying my fair and reasonable remit, I must consider whether PrePay took reasonable 
steps to request technical evidence to show the £300 had been dispensed. 
PrePay has provided us with a copy of the ATM journal roll showing Mrs As transaction, as
well as some transactions made shortly before and after. This information shows that after 
Mrs As withdrawal  the ATM balance reduced by £300.
I can see that the journal role entry in relation to Mrs As transaction looks quite different to 
the entries for withdrawals made immediately before and after  and suggests an error may 
have occurred. PrePay has explained that this was considered as part of the chargeback 
process, whereby specialist advice was obtained which confirmed the journal role entry 
doesnt mean that cash wasnt dispensed. On that basis, PrePay was satisfied thered 
been no error. 
I appreciate PrePay has followed the chargeback process. However, I dont think this limited 
evidence is enough to say that the ATM correctly dispensed the amount Mrs A requested.
PrePay hasnt been able to provide evidence to show:
The breakdown of notes dispensed to Mrs A.
The disputed amount of £300 hadnt gone into the purge bin.
The ATM balanced on 5 January 2023.
There werent any reported problems with the ATM around the time of the   
transaction.
There were no other claims raised for transactions completed on the same day.
In the absence of this information, I cant be certain that the ATM correctly dispensed the 
money to Mrs A. I appreciate PrePay has told us it did try to contact the ATM provider, but I 
think its reasonable to expect it to have carried out more enquiries and obtain more 
evidence to show the money was dispensed, particularly since it had questions over the 
validity of the journal role entry relating to Mrs As transaction.
And so, taking all this into account, even though the ATM balance reduced by £300, I cant 
rule out the possibility that there was a problem or some type of error with the ATM that 
affected Mrs As transaction in some way.
Furthermore, Mrs As testimony has been consistent throughout, and she took the action Id 
expect following the withdrawal, which adds to her credibility. Mrs A acted quickly and 
contacted PrePay within twenty minutes of making the cash withdrawal. And shes said she 
made direct contact with the ATM provider, who directed her back to PrePay. She also has a 
receipt for the transaction. 
Having considered Mrs As testimony, I find it to be more persuasive than the evidence (or 
lack of) provided by PrePay.
Putting things right
When there are two competing versions of events put forward by the parties involved in a
complaint, I must consider whatever evidence is available. I then weigh this evidence
against the balance of probabilities to decide whats more likely to have happened in thecircumstances. 
Having done this here, all things considered, and on the balance of probabilities, I think its 
more likely than not that Mrs A didnt receive the money she requested from the ATM. And it 
follows that PrePay should refund Mrs A £300 plus interest.
My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint is upheld. PrePay Technologies Limited should:
Refund Mrs A £300.
Add 8% simple interest per year to this amount from the date of the transaction to the 
date of settlement - less any tax lawfully deductible.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2023.
