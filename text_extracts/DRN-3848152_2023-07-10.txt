The complaint
Mr and Mrs L complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid to a holiday company for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being 
represented in their complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
The holiday company says that Mr and Mrs L had bought some holiday club membership 
points in August 2015. Mr and Mrs L then entered into a purchase agreement to buy some 
more membership points from the holiday company in January 2017. The purchase price of 
the additional points was £8,625 and Mr and Mrs L also entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that amount. They agreed to make 120 
monthly payments of £127.29 to Shawbrook Bank, with the first payment to be made three 
months after the advance date. The loan was repaid in July 2017.
Mr and Mrs L wrote to Shawbrook Bank in January 2020 and said that it appeared that the 
holiday company wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange loans and they asked it to 
explain its position. Shawbrook Bank said that the holiday company was granted 
authorisation to broker credit by the Financial Conduct Authority in March 2016. 
Mr and Mrs Ls representative, on their behalf, then wrote to this service in July 2020. It said, 
in summary and amongst other things, that: the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to 
arrange the loan; the membership points were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs L; there was 
an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Shawbrook Bank pursuant to section 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act 1974; there was no evidence that a credit check was conducted 
before the loan was granted; the high interest rate was also an indication of an unfair 
relationship; and Mr and Mrs L werent provided with a cooling off period.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. She said that she 
hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Shawbrook 
was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She didnt think that Mr and Mrs L being offered a scratch card or a 
meal made the relationship unfair and she said that they were given a 14 day cooling off 
period, there was no evidence that the holiday company was unable to trade or 
unauthorised, and the interest rate was clearly set out on the loan agreement. She also said 
that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr 
and Mrs L.
Mr and Mrs Ls representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs L, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendation in 
detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of Shawbrook Banks 
decision;
much of the information provided to Mr and Mrs L to induce them into purchasing the 
timeshare were representations made verbally at the time of sale and, as discovered 
much later, differed from the written terms of the timeshare agreement;
due to the spurious manner in which the timeshare product was sold to Mr and Mrs L, 
which involved a pressurised sales strategy, there are no records of the 
representations made to them during the course of the same;
the holiday company guaranteed Mr and Mrs L that purchasing the membership 
would be an investment as it would increase in value and they could sell it at a later 
date;
Mr and Mrs L only entered into the loan agreement because they relied on verbal 
representations made to them by the holiday company over the course of a lengthy 
sales presentation which they couldnt have reasonably known to be untrue or false, 
giving rise to a relationship which is unfair;
this service has found against the holiday company and Shawbrook Bank as regards 
their conduct and products generally in a decision to which it has referred; and
Shawbrook Banks failure to conduct an assessment of Mr and Mrs Ls affordability 
causes the loan to be void.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ls complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs L first raised their concerns about the authorisation of the holiday 
company with Shawbrook Bank in January 2020 - I dont consider that their letter 
would properly be considered to be a complaint and Shawbrook Bank responded to it 
and said that the holiday company was granted authorisation to broker credit by the 
Financial Conduct Authority in March 2016;
this services records show that the holiday company was authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority in January 2017 when Mr and Mrs L entered into the loan 
agreement with Shawbrook Bank so Im satisfied that the holiday company did have 
the required authorisation at that time;
the claims of misrepresentation and an unfair relationship that were made by Mr and 
Mrs Ls representative in its July 2020 letter are legal claims under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 - those claims dont constitute a complaint 
that this service can consider  this service can consider a complaint about 
Shawbrook Banks response to the claims but those claims must first have been 
made to it;
Mr and Mrs Ls representatives July 2020 letter has been provided to Shawbrook 
Bank by this service  but it hasnt provided a substantive response to those claims;
our investigator considered the claims that had been made in the July 2020 letter but 
didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld and, in the 
circumstances of Mr and Mrs Ls complaint, I consider that it would be fair and 
reasonable for me to make a decision on the merits of those claims;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ls claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs L signed documents in January 2017 including the purchase agreement, 
the terms and conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given, a key information document, the holiday companys compliance 
statement and declaration, a joint loan application form, the fixed sum loan 
agreement and Shawbrook Banks customer compliance statement;
Mr and Mrs Ls representatives July 2020 letter described the misrepresentations 
that it says were made by the holiday company to Mr and Mrs L, including that they 
would be staying in Iuxury accommodation for holidays each year but the quality of 
the apartments provided to them couldnt reasonably be compared to the Iuxury 
studios shown to them;
Mr and Mrs L had bought membership points that entitled them to use the holiday 
companys collection of properties but neither Mr and Mrs L nor their representative 
has provided detailed evidence to support their claim that the quality of the 
accommodation was misrepresented to them and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the standard of the accommodation was 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs L;
in its response to our investigators recommendation, Mr and Mrs Ls representative 
says that the holiday company guaranteed that purchasing the membership would be 
an investment as it would increase in value and they could sell it at a later date  but 
that claim wasnt included in the claims that were made to this service in its July 2020 
letter;
the holiday companys customer compliance statement and declaration that was 
signed by Mr and Mrs L says: We understand that the purchase of the Points is an 
investment in our future holidays, but that it should not be regarded as a property or 
financial investment and that any subsequent resale will depend on market 
conditions; and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
holiday company represented the points as an investment to Mr and Mrs L;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that that membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs L, that they were induced into entering into the 
purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations or that the holiday company 
breached the terms of the purchase agreement;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative has described the reasons that it says that the 
relationship between Mr and Mrs L and Shawbrook Bank was unfair, including that 
theres no evidence that a credit check was conducted before the loan was granted, 
the high interest rate is an indication of an unfair relationship, Mr and Mrs L werent 
provided with a cooling off period and the sale involved a lengthy and pressurised 
sales strategy;
Mr and Mrs L signed a joint loan application form in January 2017 in which they 
declared that they were homeowners with no mortgage, that Mr L was employed and 
that Mrs L was retired  they also signed Shawbrook Banks customer compliance 
statement in which they declared that they were confident that the loan repayments 
would be met;the loan was made to them in January 2017 and was repaid in July 2017  I consider 
that the evidence shows that Shawbrook Bank assessed the affordability of the loan 
before it was made to Mr and Mrs L and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for them at the time that it was 
made to them or that the loan is void;
Mr and Mrs L also confirmed in that customer compliance statement that theyd 
received the pre-contract credit information, a written adequate explanation 
document and the loan agreement  the loan agreement clearly set out the interest 
rate payable (on an APR, monthly and annual basis), the total charge for credit and 
the number and amount of the monthly payments  Mr and Mrs L agreed to the loan 
and, if the interest rate wasnt acceptable to them, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them not to have done so;
Mr and Mrs L signed the standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given 
which said that they had the right to withdraw from the purchase agreement within 14 
days without giving any reason and they also confirmed, in Shawbrook Banks 
customer compliance statement, that theyd signed the holiday companys withdrawal 
form;
the loan agreement also set out Mr and Mrs Ls right to withdraw from the loan  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs L contacted the holiday company or 
Shawbrook Bank within any applicable withdrawal periods about withdrawing from 
either or both agreements;
Mr and Mrs L signed the holiday companys customer compliance statement and 
declaration which said: We confirm that we have been treated courteously during the 
sales presentation, that we have been given plenty of time to consider if the product 
is right for us and we have not been put under and pressure to purchase our Points; 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs L were 
unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement or the loan agreement in 
January 2017 or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against 
them;
Mr and Mrs Ls representative has referred to a decision from this service in which it 
was found that the relationship between the debtor and creditor was unfair  but this 
service considers each complaint on its individual merits and that complaint related to 
a different type of product to the points that were bought by Mr and Mrs L;
Im not persuaded that any claim that Mr and Mrs L would be able to make under 
section 140A that their relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair would be upheld 
and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the relationship 
was unfair;
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to the letter that Mr and Mrs L sent to in 
January 2020 was fair and reasonable and that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld the claims that were made in their 
representatives July 2020 letter  and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Shawbrook Bank has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr 
and Mrs L about the loan; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs L for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
points, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to them any of the money that they paid under 
the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs L to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 August 2023.
