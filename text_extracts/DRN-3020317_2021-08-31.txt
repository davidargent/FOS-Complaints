The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont let him pay his PayPal Credit
account using the methods set out in the account agreement.
What happened
Mr W said that hed applied for PayPal credit through his pre-existing PayPal account, but
now PayPal was no longer allowing him to pay by direct debit, standing order, bank transfer,
or online debit card payment. It would only let him pay by phone, or by linking his bank
account, and he didnt want to take up either of those options. Mr W wanted PayPal to let
him pay using the methods hed originally agreed to.
Mr W said hed been trying to sort this out with PayPal, but he felt it had been dragging its
feet, which had resulted in him being served with two missed payments notices, and a
default notice.
Mr W wanted PayPal to reinstate the old repayment methods, to withdraw its default notice
and remove the missed payment markers on his credit file, and to pay him compensation.
PayPal said that Mr W entered into his original agreement with it, for this account, while he
was under 18. Mr W hasnt contested this. And as Mr W had confirmed his birth date, his
underlying PayPal account has been permanently limited. Because of that, he wasnt able to
use the full range of options for paying towards his PayPal credit balance. Mr W could still
pay over the phone. But when he didnt do that, PayPal first asked for payment, then it
defaulted this debt.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said it was reasonable for
PayPal to limit the underlying account. And then it had made clear to Mr W that he was only
able to pay off his credit balance over the phone, because of the limit on his account.
Our investigator said that Mr W did have a way to pay his debt, so she didnt think it was
unreasonable for PayPal to record a default when he didnt make payments. Our investigator
didnt think that PayPal had been unfair, and she didnt think it had to do any more.
Mr W didnt agree. He said that a full credit check was done when he took out credit, and
PayPal must have known then that hed opened the underlying account when he was under
18. And he also said that his PayPal account was entirely separate to his PayPal credit
account. So, while he thought it was fair for his normal PayPal account to be restricted, he
didnt think PayPal acted fairly or lawfully when these restrictions were extended to his
PayPal credit account.
Mr W said there was no contractual clause or mechanism in the credit agreement which 
would allow PayPal to refuse payments by direct debit. Mr W said that the PayPal user 
agreement doesnt govern the PayPal credit account, but rather PayPal credit is its own 
entity with its own contractual agreement which supersedes the PayPal user agreement.
Because Mr W didnt agree with our investigator, this case was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
Mr Ws underlying PayPal agreement has been restricted. Mr W doesnt contest this, 
or the reasons for it. He appears to accept that he has breached PayPals user 
agreement because he opened this account when he was under the age of 18. And I 
think thats right.
Mr W thinks that PayPal shouldve been well aware of this when he entered into his 
PayPal credit agreement. I havent seen anything to suggest to me that PayPal had 
realised the significance of Mr Ws age at that time.
And Mr W doesnt think that any dispute about his underlying PayPal agreement 
should affect his PayPal credit account. He says theyre separate, and one doesnt 
govern the other.
I dont think thats right. I think its clear that the credit agreement Mr W entered into 
isnt a standalone agreement. It operates together with his pre-existing PayPal 
account. And the credit agreement itself states 
15.4. We may close the Credit Account and demand repayment of the full 
amount you owe us if:

E. you have broken the terms of another agreement with us
We know that Mr W had breached the terms of his original agreement with PayPal. 
So, under the PayPal credit agreement, PayPal had the right to end its lending 
relationship with Mr W, and ask him for all the money back. But it hasnt done that. It 
looks as if, instead of asking him for full repayment, PayPal has suggested that he 
could continue to pay by instalments. Because his underlying account was limited, he 
would have to make these payments over the phone.
I know that Mr W wanted to make payments within the terms of his original 
agreement with PayPal, but PayPal was entitled to bring that agreement to an end. In 
this situation, I think that what PayPal offered Mr W was fair and reasonable.
I also note that PayPal did give Mr W a way to make payments to his debt. I 
understand that Mr W didnt want to use this, but Ive explained why I think it was a 
reasonable approach for PayPal to take. And after PayPal had explained how Mr W 
could pay, Mr W didnt make payments towards his debt. So I dont think it was 
unreasonable for PayPal then to notify credit reference agencies that hed missed 
payments, or later to default this debt.
I know Mr W will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr W didnt reply. PayPal said it agreed with my provisional decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2021.
