Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint.  He thought  that MYJAR shouldnt  have  
approved loans 4 to 9. MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  so the complaint has 
been passed to me, an ombudsman, to make  a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN25638242the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided  to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
MYJAR asked Mr W for information about his income and expenditure and it carried out 
credit checks. It says it used this information to work out Mr Ws disposable income and 
assessed whether  the loans were affordable for him.
For loans 1-3, given  the amounts lent, what was apparent  about  Mr Ws circumstances at 
the time and his relatively short borrowing history with MYJAR, I dont think  it wouldve been 
proportionate to ask him for the amount of information needed  to show the lending  was 
unsustainable. There wasnt  anything in the information Mr W provided  or the information 
MYJAR shouldve been  aware of (including the credit search results), which meant it 
wouldve been proportionate to start verifying  what Mr W was saying.
But by loan 4, I think its reasonable  to say that Mr W was, more likely than not, having 
longer term problems repaying his loans. And MYJAR shouldve  been aware of this. He had 
taken out three short term loans in quick succession and was asking to borrow  again on the 
same day he was repaying his previous loan. So a pattern of dependency was already 
emerging in respect  of his lending. 
Mr W asked for loan 4 only a month after he had first approached MYJAR. The amount he 
asked for had increased since  his first loan as well. I think  it would have become apparent  at 
this stage that he would have been  struggling to repay the amount owed. So I dont think it 
was reasonable  for MYJAR  to have assumed that Mr W would be in a position to make 
further repayments without it causing him problems.  So I dont think  it shouldve  approved  
loan 4 or any loan after this point.  So Im upholding Mr Ws complaint about  loans  4-9. 
And Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of MYJARs lending  history with Mr W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
Ref: DRN25638243By loan 7, the amount  Mr W was borrowing had increased significantly, with him 
asking for 10 times that of his first loan.
MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ws indebtedness had become  unsustainable.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 7 was 
taken out around 14 months after Mr Ws first. And as I have already found, it was for 
a much larger amount.  Mr W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect; service 
a debt to MYJAR  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr W lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time.
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint and MYJAR should  now put things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 9 should be removed from Mr Ws 
credit file. 
Mr W still owes MYJAR some of the principal balance  he borrowed on loan 9. MYJAR may 
deduct the outstanding  balance of loan 9 from the compensation that is due to him. But, to 
be clear,  that outstanding  balance should  be recalculated to remove any interest and 
charges, whilst taking account  of any repayments  Mr W has made on that loan as though 
they were applied against the principal sum borrowed.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr W a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint. MYJAR Limited should put 
things right by doing what  Ive said above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 February  2020.
