An adjudicator considered  this complaint  and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt think 
QuickQuid had acted responsibly  when it approved loan 4. QuickQuid didnt accept this, so the 
complaint was passed to me to decide.  Theres been no further dispute about loans 1-3, so my 
decision will be about  the only loan still in dispute  loan 4.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken  into account  this Services approach to complaints 
about short-term  lending,  which is set out on our website.
In response to the adjudicators opinion, QuickQuid  didnt provide any new evidence specifically 
relating to Mr L. It said:
In response  to your assessment which  recommends CashEuroNet UK uphold a loan which was 
funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot agree to your 
recommendations. Please  note that in CashEuroNet  UKs initial response to FOS we provided 
detailed information  indicating why these loans  were responsibly  lent to Mr [L]. 
This Service has responded  to QuickQuids generic arguments about loans  funded after 
March 2015 directly and through earlier final decisions. So I am not going to address  this point  
directly here, though  I have  considered it alongside  everything else in making  my decision.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ls complaint  and what both parties  have said. And 
as is required of me, I will determine the complaint with reference to what  is, in [my] opinion, fair 
and reasonable  in all the circumstances of the case. (DISP 3.6.1R)
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr L borrowed the loans in question. Bearing  in mind the 
rules and guidance  set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer  Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC),  I would expect a lenders  affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would expect 
Ref: DRN42337282QuickQuid to be conversant with these  through previous  ombudsman decisions, particularly 
recent decisions, which set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater  the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit  in a sustainable  way. So, for example,  Id expect a 
lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks:
the higher  the loan amount,
the lower the consumers income;  or
the longer  the lending relationship.
When he applied for loan 4, Mr L told QuickQuid he was employed, with net monthly  income of 
£1,100 and total monthly living expenses of £240. The only expenditure he declared was £90 for 
utility bills, £50 for transport, £50 for food and £50 for undefined other expenses.  He said he had 
no other monthly credit commitments and no housing  costs.
QuickQuid carried  out credit checks on Mr L  but it hasnt  shown us the full results of these 
checks. It has instead provided a figure it calls EDI, meaning  estimated disposable income. 
QuickQuid says it calculated  Mr Ls monthly EDI at the time of loan 4 was £860. This appears  to 
be a simple deduction of Mr Ls declared  expenditure from his declared  income.
So it seems QuickQuid made  no adjustments to Mr Ls expenditure as a result of its credit  
checks.
I dont  think the assessment QuickQuid  carried out was proportionate in the circumstances of 
loan 4. Mr L was asking  for an advance  of almost  two-thirds of his monthly income  and the 
largest repayment hed have to make was almost 80% of his monthly  income. Even  taking into 
account that this loan was repayable across  three months, I consider  that to be a very substantial 
repayment relative to Mr Ls income.
Given the above, I think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr L for some form 
of proof  of income  and expenditure   as well as check whether Mr L had any other short-term 
credit outstanding. QuickQuid hasnt shown us that it did any of these things.
Having said this, I think that, even  based on the checks  it did carry out, QuickQuid ought to have 
realised a loan with a final repayment of this size was unlikely to be sustainably affordable  for Mr 
L. Ill explain why.
For the loan to be affordable to Mr L, hed have to save money  in April and/or May 2017 to make 
the largest payment  in June 2017. This is because the largest payment exceeded QuickQuids  
(likely optimistic) estimate  of Mr Ls monthly disposable  income. As Ive explained above, I dont 
think that estimate arose from a proportionate check.  But I dont think  its likely  a more thorough  
assessment wouldve shown Mr L was in a better position.
Ref: DRN42337283I dont  think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude Mr L was in a position to save each  
money month. From May until November 2016, Mr L spent around  five months indebted to 
QuickQuid, taking out loans in quick succession. I dont think hed have returned for 
high-cost credit so frequently  if he was really  able to put aside money  each month. I dont 
consider the gap between loans 3 and 4 was long enough for it to be reasonable to suggest Mr L 
was likely  to have been  on a more stable financial footing, particularly as he was now borrowing 
substantially more than he had previously (significantly more than the total sum of loans  1-3).
And by requiring Mr L to save to make the final repayment,  I think  QuickQuid was aware  there  
was a risk that he wouldnt  be able to make the final payment when it fell due. It left it to Mr L to 
manage that risk, rather than, for example,  structuring the loan repayments to reflect its 
expectations of Mr L. 
That the loan was not likely  to be sustainably affordable for Mr L is borne  out by what  actually 
happened after it was approved. It was not repaid as it shouldve been and it took 
Mr L an extra  three months to repay QuickQuid.
In summary, I do not think it was responsible for QuickQuid to approve loan 4. I think it ought to 
have realised, from the information it had, that the loan was not likely to be affordable  for Mr L. 
So Im upholding  his complaint about it.
putting things  right
QuickQuid must:
refund the interest and charges Mr L paid on loan 4
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when he paid them until the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about loan 4 from Mr Ls credit history
HM Revenue & Customs  requires  QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must 
give Mr L a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking  the steps  set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or reject 
my decision  before 25 March 2019.
