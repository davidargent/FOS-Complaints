The complaint
O, a limited company through its director Mr S complains that it lost money after National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) delayed opening its business account.
O wants NatWest to pay significantly more compensation than it has to date.
What happened
On 20 August 2020, O made an online application to open a NatWest business account. 
NatWest opened the account just over a week later but due to an error on its part, the 
account opening documentation was made under the wrong brand. 
NatWest placed a no operations marker on Os account pending the return of the correct 
paperwork. O re-submitted the paperwork and NatWest returned the account to operation on 
24 September 2020.
Before this service became involved NatWest paid O a total of £400 to apologise for the 
delays and poor customer service. NatWest didnt agree that it was responsible for any 
potential losses. O doesnt consider this to be adequate so brought a complaint to this 
service.
The investigator agreed that NatWest had made mistakes, but he didnt recommend that it 
pay more compensation to O.
O disagrees with the investigators recommendation. O says NatWest didnt tell it that the 
account was opened for three weeks. And that NatWest then placed a block on the account 
until the end of September 2020. O says it never received a welcome pack and that it made 
many attempts to contact NatWest by email, phone and online.
O says that it has had sales of around £20,000 each month for the first five months so could 
have expected to generate a similar figure had the bank account become operational when it 
expected.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont wish to appear simplistic in my approach, but I think its agreed that NatWest made 
mistakes during the process to open Os bank account. I dont intend setting these out in 
detail again. 
The issue I need to consider is whether NatWest has done and paid enough to put things 
right for O. I dont doubt that the mistakes and delays caused inconvenience, but I dont find 
that NatWest should compensate O more than it already has. I say this for several reasons. 
O argues that due to NatWests mistakes, it couldnt start trading and lost money as a result. 
But Mr S told the investigator that they used personal bank accounts to make payments on 
behalf of O. So, I dont consider NatWests delays in setting up the account correctly 
necessarily meant that O couldnt trade in the meantime.
O was a newly incorporated company. This makes it difficult to say what level of profit it 
wouldve achieved in the first month of trading  even if it went on to do well shortly after.
Even if NatWest hadnt made mistakes, I cant say that O wouldnt have experienced some 
delay between applying for the account and it being opened. NatWest needed to carry out 
checks and more information might have been required. I dont think its a straightforward 
argument to say that because NatWest made mistakes when opening the account, its 
responsible for four or five weeks of lost income.
Even if I was to agree that NatWests delays led to O losing some profit for a few weeks, Ive 
checked the terms and conditions of the business account. These confirm what NatWest 
says about not paying for potential or indirect losses. This means I can only make an award 
for the service problems O encountered when opening the business account.
I dont underestimate the effort that O went to when trying to get to the bottom of the 
problems with the opening of its account. But I find that whats already been paid to O is 
reasonable, so I wont be asking NatWest to do anything else. 
If O still hasnt received the account welcome pack it should let NatWest know.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint in the sense that I find National 
Westminster Bank Plc has already done enough to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2021.
