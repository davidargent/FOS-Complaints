The complaint
S, a partnership, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) treated it unfairly 
in the way the bank issued a lending decision.
S is represented by its partners.
What happened
S complained to NatWest recently about a commercial loan it took out with the bank around 
2008. S says this loan was one of two loans that NatWest had agreed to lend, and that the 
interest rate and arrangement fee had been agreed around the time the first loan was taken 
out the previous year. S says NatWest changed its stance when S later wanted to go ahead 
with the second loan. S says the bank increased the interest rate on offer and wanted to 
charge a higher arrangement fee. 
S says NatWest threatened to withdraw both loans if it didnt accept the new terms and says 
the bank blackmailed it into agreeing. S says its partners have since been worried about its 
standing with the bank, given the potential that NatWest could decide to withdraw the loans. 
To put things right, S wants NatWest to honour what was originally agreed and its 
overpayments to be refunded. S also wants NatWest to provide assurances that the loans 
will not be withdrawn without due cause.
In its response, NatWest concluded that there was no evidence that S was pressured in any 
way. Remaining unhappy, S asked this service to review its concerns.
After NatWest agreed that this complaint was made within the relevant timescales, one of 
our investigators decided that the bank hadnt pressured S in the way S described. S didnt 
agree, so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
S also referred other complaints it has against NatWest alongside this complaint. Our 
investigator has already explained why these issues werent referred to this service within 
the relevant timescales  so I wont be commenting on the other complaints in my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think its important to point out that the issue S complains about took place well over ten 
years ago. So NatWest can only provide us with limited records and information. S has 
helpfully sent detailed copies of communications it had with the bank around that time. And 
although Ive looked at everything both parties have sent, Ill only comment on what I think is 
relevant. Id like to assure the parties that, even though I may not specifically mention 
comments or information submitted by both parties, I have reviewed all the information on 
file for this complaint. 
Having done so, I cant fairly conclude that NatWest has done something wrong. I know S 
partners will be disappointed to hear this, so Ill explain why.
Its not within my remit to tell NatWest how it should set and apply its lending criteria. This is 
for the bank to determine. My role here is only to consider whether it treated S fairly in the 
application of its lending decision. 
Ive reviewed the available communications that took place between S and NatWest around 
the time. I can see that S was in regular contact with its relationship manager at the bank, 
who seems to have been dealing with the arrangements for the second loan. The key piece 
of information here seems to be an email sent by NatWest to S in November 2008. I can see 
that NatWest responded to several questions raised by S, including one where S had asked 
what would happen if it couldnt reach an agreement about the increased interest rate and 
arrangement fee.
NatWest responded that the worst case scenario would be that the bank would issue notice 
requesting that S find another lender  and this would apply to the whole borrowing 
(including the first loan). The reply added that the situation was a long way off from this 
course of action.
I appreciate that this put S in a difficult position. It would either need to agree the revised 
terms and sign up to higher interest and an increased arrangement fee. Or S could decline, 
but possibly face having to find an alternative lender. But I dont think what NatWest said 
was threatening, nor do I think that the bank blackmailed S into agreeing the revised terms. 
It seems to me that NatWest responded to a specific query from S, rather than exert any 
pressure or threaten S.
Its clear from the communications that S was reluctant to agree to what was offered, but, as 
I said earlier, its up to NatWest to set its lending criteria and decide on what terms it would 
lend to S. I acknowledge that the offer was less favourable than what S thought it would get, 
but it was ultimately S choice to accept or decline what was offered.
S says it had already agreed the terms for this loan at the time the first loan was taken out 
the previous year. But I havent seen any sort of formal agreement that confirms this was the 
case. Its possible that S may have had an understanding with its relationship manager 
about the second loan it would eventually take out, but theres nothing Ive seen that 
suggests this was an agreement set in stone and not open to change. 
As Ive pointed out, its ultimately NatWests decision to determine its lending terms. I know 
S feels it had no choice but to sign the agreement and accept the loan on these terms, but 
Im not of the opinion that this was because NatWest pressured S in any way.
In summary, although I empathise with the difficult decision S faced at the time, it ultimately 
agreed to the terms of the loan. I havent seen anything that makes me think NatWest 
pressured or threatened S in the way S describes. So I wont be upholding this complaint.. 
My final decision
Im not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2022.
