Complaint
Miss M has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly continued 
to charge her excessive fees, instead of converting her debt into a loan, when she struggled 
to repay her overdraft.
Background
One of our adjudicators looked at Miss Ms complaint and thought NatWest should have 
realised Miss Ms overdraft had already become unsustainable for her by March 2017. So it 
needed to refund all the interest, fees and charges it added to Miss Ms overdraft from this 
point. NatWest didnt respond, so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I think NatWest acted unfairly when it 
continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees from March 2017. By this point, it 
was evident Miss M was struggling financially. 
A look at her statements leading up to this period shows Miss M hadnt seen a credit balance 
for a significant period of time. And Miss M was spending most of the time with a balance 
towards the top of her limit. Equally by this stage there was a repeated pattern of the credits 
going into the account being insufficient to make any inroads to the outstanding balance. 
So NatWest had no reasonable basis to continue believing the overdraft could be repaid 
within a reasonable period of time. Bearing all of this in mind, I think that by March 2017 
NatWest should have realised that Miss M had reached a position where she wasnt going to 
be able to clear her indebtedness without help. And I think that it should have stopped 
providing the overdraft on the same terms and treated Miss M with forbearance rather than 
adding even more interest, fees and charges on the overdraft. 
All of this means that NatWest should have realised that Miss M was experiencing financial 
difficulty and offered her help to repay what she owed. As NatWest didnt react to Miss Ms 
account usage, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably. Miss M ended up paying 
additional interest, fees and charges at a time when she was already experiencing difficulty. 
So Im satisfied that Miss M lost out because of what NatWest did wrong and that it should 
put things right.
Fair compensation  what NatWest needs to do to put things right for Miss M
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Miss Ms complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Miss Ms current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and 
charges applied to it from March 2017 onwards are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Miss M to arrange a suitable repayment 
plan, Miss M is encouraged to get in contact with and cooperate with NatWest to 
reach a suitable agreement for this. If it considers it appropriate to record 
negative information on Miss Ms credit file, it should reflect what would have 
been recorded had it started the process of taking corrective action on the 
overdraft in March 2017. NatWest can also reduce Miss Ms overdraft limit by the 
amount of refund if it considers it appropriate to do so, as long as doing so 
wouldnt leave her over her limit.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Miss M along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Miss Ms credit file. 
NatWest can also reduce Miss Ms overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it 
considers it appropriate to do so.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Ms complaint. National Westminster 
Bank Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 February 2022.
