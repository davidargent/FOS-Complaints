Loans 2 Go has been unable to provide the documents from the time of sale of loans 1  3. 
It says due to the time that has passed, it no longer holds the documentation for those loans. 
It has also said it believes Mr H has complained about those loans too late.
Our adjudicator looked at what both parties said and thought that Mr H complained about 
loans 1  3 on time but due to the lack of information available, she couldnt fairly assess 
those loans and say Loans 2 Go had done something wrong.
Our adjudicator looked at loans 4  12 and thought that Loans 2 Go was wrong to lend all 
the loans. Loans 2 Go has agreed that it shouldnt have lent loans 5  12 but says it wasnt 
wrong to lend loan 4.
As the complaint hasnt been fully resolved, its been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Loans 1  3
In relation to loans 1  3, I dont think it has much of an effect here whether it is one this 
service can look into or not. I say this because due to the lack of documentation from the 
time of sale, it isnt possible for me to fairly decide on whether Loans 2 Go has done 
something wrong and so I cant ask it to put things right in relation to those loans.
Loans 4  12
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive 
referred to this when looking at Loans 2 Gos decision to lend.
Loans 2 Go has agreed that it shouldnt have lent loans 5  12 and as there isnt a 
continuing dispute about those loans, Ive focussed on making a decision about loan 4.
By the time Mr H was borrowing loan 4, hed had three previous loans with Loans 2 Go all of 
which were refinanced. The interests on these loans werent insignificant and I think that 
Loans 2 Go needed to have a thorough knowledge about Mr Hs circumstances at the time 
and also had to take into account what it knew about him  his lending history with Loans 2 
Go.
Mr H had been borrowing from Loans 2 Go for about four years when he was lent loan 4, 
there werent any breaks in the lending. The results of Loans 2 Gos search into Mr Hs credit 
file showed that he had several historic defaults, most of which still had outstanding 
balances on them. The credit file suggests that Mr H wasnt making the payments on these 
balances and so the balances werent reducing.
I can see that Loans 2 Go saw copies of Mr Hs bank statement and I can see that he was 
borrowing from at least another high cost lender recently. And so while Loans 2 Go argues 
that it wasnt wrong to lend this loan to Mr H, I think it should have been aware that Mr H was 
likely dependent on credit from it and was likely struggling to manage his money which is 
why he needed to keep returning for more loans.
In those circumstances, Loans 2 Go should have seen that further borrowing was likely 
causing an adverse impact on Mr Hs finances and so it shouldnt have lent loan 4 as well.
Loans 2 Go needs to put things right for loans 4  12.
Putting things right  what Loans 2 Go needs to do
refund all interest, fees and charges Mr H paid towards loans 4 - 11;
add interest of 8% simple a year on the payments from the date they were paid (if 
they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 12 and treat all payments Mr H 
made towards that loan as payments towards the capital amount of £250.
reworking the account for loan 12 is likely to result in Mr H paying more than the 
capital, then Loans 2 Go should add interest of 8% simple a year on the 
overpayments from the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 - 12 from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans 2 Go to take off tax from this interest. Loans 2 Go must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Loans 2 Go Limited 
should put things right as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
