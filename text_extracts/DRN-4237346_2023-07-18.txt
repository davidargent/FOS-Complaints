The complaint
Mrs F complains that NewDay Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
In July 2020 Mrs F applied for a Fluid credit card. NewDay approved the application and 
gave Mrs F a card with an initial credit limit of £900. The credit limit was increased to £1700 
in December 2020, to £2700 in May 2021, to £4700 in September 2021, to £5600 in March 
2022 and to £6100 in May 2022.
Mrs F complained that NewDay had lent to her irresponsibly. 
NewDay upheld the complaint from the time of the credit limit increase in September 2021. It 
refunded fees and charges to Mrs Fs account totalling £1828.41.
NewDay also upheld Mrs Fs complaint about a Marbles credit card shed been given in 
January 2022 with an initial credit limit of £900. The credit limit had been increased to £1500 
in May 2022 and to £1700 in September 2022. NewDay upheld the complaint in full and 
refunded all interest, fees and charges to Mrs Fs account totalling £300.67.
Mrs F remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said he couldnt see anything which showed 
that NewDay had acted irresponsibly in opening the Fluid account in July 202 or in 
increasing the credit limit up to September 2021.
Mrs F didnt agree. She said that at the time she applied for the Fluid card in July 202 she 
had unsecured debt of £21,100 and that she had made several applications for credit which 
shouldve indicted to NewDay that she wasnt coping financially.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending on 
our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mrs Fs complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, NewDay needed to complete reasonable and proportionate checks 
to ensure that Mrs F could sustainably repay what was being lent to her.
Theres no set list of checks that a lender has to do. But lenders are required to have regard 
to things like the amount being lent, the total amount repayable, the monthly repayment and 
the consumers individual circumstances when deciding whats reasonable and 
proportionate.
Ive limited my decision to the Fluid card here, because Mrs Fs complaint about the Marbles 
card has already been fully upheld by NewDay.
Account opening July 2020 
When Mrs F applied for a Fluid card she declared income of £28,500. She also declared 
unsecured debt of £21,100.
NewDay carried out a credit search. This showed that Mrs F had no defaults, no accounts in 
arrears, no payday loans and no CCJs.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the checks carried out by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate. Theres nothing in the information gathered from the checks which wouldve 
given NewDay cause for concern, or which meant that further checks needed to be carried 
out.
Ive gone on to consider whether the lending decision was fair. Mrs F had quite a high level 
of unsecured debt. However, she was managing this well and her debt to income ratio 
wasnt particularly high. Theres nothing in the information Ive seen to indicate that Mrs F 
wasnt likely to be able to sustainably repay the credit. In the circumstances I think the 
lending decision was fair.
Credit limit increases December 2020 and May 2021
Before increasing the credit limit, NewDay looked at how Mrs F had been managing the 
account. It found no instances of late or missed payments and no instances of exceeding the 
credit limit. NewDay also carried out a credit search and found no information to indicate that 
Mrs F wasnt managing her other accounts well and found nothing to suggest that she was 
struggling to repay her debts or that she was overly reliant on credit.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks 
before increasing the credit limit in December 2020 and May 2021.
I also think the lending decisions on both occasions were fair. I say this because there was 
nothing in the information gathered by NewDay to suggest that Mrs F was unlikely to be able 
to sustainably repay the increased credit.
For the reasons Ive explained, Im unable to say that NewDay acted unfairly in opening the 
Fluid account or in increasing the credit limit in December 2020 and May 2021. So I wont be 
asking NewDay to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 August 2023.
