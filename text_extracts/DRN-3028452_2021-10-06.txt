The complaint
Miss T complained that PayrNet Limited repeatedly blocked access to her account, leaving 
her unable to access her benefit payments and buy essential items.  
What happened
Towards the end of 2020, Miss Ts account with PayrNet was blocked and she was asked to 
provide some verification documents.  She provided these and the account was unblocked.
About a month later, the account was blocked again.  When Miss T found this out, she 
contacted PayrNet to find out why.  And she told PayrNet that she needed the account to be 
unblocked, as her benefits were due to be paid into it.  Without access to those, she couldnt 
buy the most basic essentials, such as food.
On this second occasion, Miss Ts account remained locked for 12 days.  During that time, 
her benefits were due to be paid in. But the payment was rejected, leaving Miss T without 
any money.
Miss T complained to PayrNet.  PayrNet considered her complaint but rejected it.  They said 
that theyre required by their regulator to understand how customers use their accounts.  
And their terms and conditions allow them to restrict a customers access to their account 
while they do this.
Miss T wasnt satisfied with PayrNets resolution and brought her complaint to us.  Our 
investigator noted that PayrNet had recognised the account shouldnt have been restricted a 
second time.  So he focused on the impact not being able to access her money had had on 
Miss T.  He thought not being able to access her benefits had had a significant impact on 
her.  He said PayrNet should pay Miss T £250 compensation for this.
Miss T acknowledged the investigators view.  PayrNet responded, saying Miss Ts balance 
was only a few pounds when the account was first suspended, and they could not say her 
benefits werent paid because of the suspension.  They said Miss T could access the 
account the day her benefits were paid in.  And they didnt consider a suspension of 12 days 
to be excessive.
Because PayrNet didnt agree with the investigators view, Ive been asked to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done that, Im upholding Miss Ts complaint.  Ill explain why.
When our service receives a complaint, we look at whether the business complained about 
has done something wrong.  If they did, we may direct them to pay their customer 
compensation.  We decide how much compensation should be awarded by considering the 
impact of what the business did (or didnt do) had on the individual bringing the complaint.
Ive read the account terms and conditions.  These do allow PayrNet to block access.  But 
theyve accepted they made a mistake when they did this for the second time.  So, like our 
investigator, Ive focused on the impact that mistake had on Miss T. 
Putting things right
Ive thought carefully about that impact.  Miss T was without money and didnt know when 
that would change.  She couldnt buy food and other essential items.  She told our 
investigator she had to rely on food banks.
PayrNet has suggested the inconvenience to Miss T was trivial.  I dont agree. I think the 
situation she was in would have been extremely worrying for anyone.  That should be 
recognised.
And Ive considered PayrNets other comments.  Im not persuaded that the balance on  
Miss Ts account is relevant to my consideration.  The balance was low.  But it should have 
been available to Miss T  and it wasnt.  And, while I note PayrNets comment that the 
receipt of her benefits may have been declined for a number of reasons, I think the most 
likely reason was that Miss Ts account was suspended.  And that led to Miss T being 
without her benefits for additional days.
I agree with our investigator that Miss T should be compensated for the distress and 
inconvenience PayrNets error caused her.  And I agree that £250 is the right amount to 
reflect the impact on her.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Ts complaint about PayrNet Limited and 
directing PayrNet to pay her £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused by their 
mistake.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2021.
