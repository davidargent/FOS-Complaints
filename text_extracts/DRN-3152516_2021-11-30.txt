The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt grant them 
the mortgage they wanted.
What happened
In July 2020 Mr and Mrs W obtained a mortgage agreement in principle that said they could 
borrow £512,000 in connection with a house move. The agreement in principle was 
confirmed by their mortgage broker. Mr W says he knew the agreement was subject to final 
underwriting checks. However, he also knew his credit history was good and that his broker 
had used NatWests affordability systems. So he felt confident to search for a property to 
buy.
Mr and Mrs W found a property and their mortgage application was submitted on 4 
September 2020. However, once the application had passed on to the underwriting stage, 
NatWest said they would only lend Mr and Mrs W £489,737. 
Mr W says their broker was surprised by this as hed checked the application with a NatWest 
business development colleague, and hed had no issues before processing the application.
NatWest said there were technical issues with the mortgage affordability tool when Mr Ws 
broker used it for Mr and Mrs Ws application. The tool had calculated Mr Ws bonuses more 
favourably than they should have been given that Mr Ws bonuses were discretionary, not 
guaranteed.
Mr W was very unhappy about this. He said the problem with the mortgage affordability tool 
shouldve been discovered sooner. Hed spent a lot of time and emotional effort looking at 
properties and building a chain. The move was important for his family and he didnt want to 
lose out on the house he was buying. Nor did he want the sale of the property he owned at 
the time to fall through. Mr W has told us that he felt a great deal of pressure to complete the 
purchase quickly. The housing market was moving fast, and he was worried lenders might 
change their approach as the pandemic developed.
That all meant that Mr W felt he had to proceed with the purchase using the NatWest 
mortgage for £489,737 even though it meant hed have to use his savings to pay for the 
shortfall in borrowing. That meant that he couldnt put his savings to use elsewhere  for his 
children and to develop the property he was buying. Mr W felt that as NatWests affordability 
calculator was faulty, NatWest shouldve have been more flexible by changing its position 
and lending more.
Mr W also complained about the time it took NatWest to take the valuation fee and arrange 
for the valuation once hed decided to proceed with the mortgage. 
NatWest agreed it had made mistakes with Mr and Mrs Ws mortgage. It apologised and 
agreed to pay them £400 compensation for its handling of the matter. Mr W didnt think that 
was enough.
After Mr and Mrs W complained to us NatWest told us the agreement in principle, and the 
initial affordability checks completed by the broker werent intended to be an official offer of 
lending. Our investigator recognised this. 
Our investigator also considered what Mr Ws argument that he couldnt anticipate the issue 
with the affordability system. Our investigator appreciated that. However, he said the 
agreement in principle indicated a maximum lend amount subject to the final checks. So 
Mr W wouldve known there were risks associated with choosing to apply for and borrow up 
to that maximum amount. Our investigator said he was also conscious that the relevant rules 
and guidance are clear that NatWest had to lend responsibly. That meant that NatWest had 
to follow their lending policy. NatWest also had to justify and evidence the checks they made 
when lending. 
Our investigator asked NatWest to consider lending Mr and Mrs W more money. NatWest 
said it would consider this. However, Mr and Mrs W would need to make a formal application 
for a further advance on their mortgage so that they can assess whether they could afford to 
borrow more money. That seemed reasonable to him bearing in mind NatWests obligation 
to lend responsibly.
Our investigator didnt feel that NatWest were unreasonably slow to notify Mr and Mrs Ws 
broker of its decision to only lend £489,737. So while he appreciated how disappointed Mr W 
was by NatWests decision he thought that £400 compensation was a fair and reasonable 
amount to resolve this complaint.
Mr W disagreed and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. He provided 
a statement from his broker that supported the points hed made directly. The broker said the 
service and rationale behind NatWests decision wasnt normal. The time it took for NatWest 
to say that it wasnt going to lend £512,000 and get to the bottom of what had happened left 
Mr and Mrs W no option to look to borrow from another provider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I dont think NatWest needs to do more to resolve this complaint. Ill explain 
why.
Its clear from what Mr A has told us that he remains very unhappy about what happened. 
He has written in some detail about the time and effort he went to secure the property he 
was buying, the importance of the new property to him and his family, and the worries he 
had that the property chain could collapse if he didnt proceed quickly. On top of the fast-
moving market conditions at the time Mr A has told us that he was buying a house in high 
demand and selling a house in low demand, so that put further pressure on him. In the 
circumstances, he doesnt feel that NatWest acted appropriately at such a critical time.
I appreciate Mr As position and his strength of feeling about this matter. But I have to 
balance that against what NatWest have told us. NatWest have accepted that there was a 
problem with its mortgage affordability tool, and recognised that its service wasnt as good 
as it should be. However, they are clear that they werent required to lend any money until all 
the underwriting checks were completed after the application was made.
Mr W doesnt dispute this. Instead he says NatWest shouldve identified the problem sooner.
NatWests notes show that they first told the broker and there was a problem as a result of 
Mr Ws bonuses on 17 September 2020. That was around two weeks after Mr and Mrs W formally applied for the mortgage. Initially NatWest said the broker had made a mistake. 
However, it became clear that the fault was NatWests.
Although I appreciate Mr and Mrs Ws frustration about this, and their strong feeling that 
there shouldve have been a problem in the first place, our service isnt set up to punish 
businesses for any faults or errors that occur. Its evident however that there was a fault with 
NatWests mortgage affordability tool and nor is it clear to me that NatWest were in a 
position to identify that there was a problem until the mortgage application was made and 
the underwriting process began. I say that because there seems to be no dispute that the 
problem occurred because of an unusual problem with NatWests system that hadnt 
previously been identified. Mr Ws broker himself describes the problem as rare. In the 
circumstances, I dont think it would be fair for me to say that NatWest shouldve realised 
there was a problem sooner. As I said above, I can see that NatWest first contacted the 
broker about the issue around two weeks after the mortgage application was made. I can 
also see that NatWest followed the matter up promptly after that.
Ultimately Mr and Mrs W decided to proceed with the mortgage despite it only being for 
£489,737, and they were able to buy the house they wanted. I appreciate what Mr W has 
told us about the reasons why they proceeded with the mortgage at the time given the 
pressures they felt to move quickly. While I appreciate what a stressful time it was for Mr and 
Mrs W, I dont think it would be fair for me to hold NatWest responsible for those pressures.
Mr W thinks NatWest shouldve lent more money to him. I understand his position on this. 
But as our investigator said, NatWest is required to lend responsibly and be in a position to 
demonstrate that a borrower can afford a mortgage it offers. It wouldnt be appropriate for 
me to comment on the commercial decision NatWest took to only lend Mr and Mrs W 
£489,737. Im aware that Mr and Mrs W want to borrow more money, and Im conscious that 
theyre free to do that now - with NatWest or another provider. NatWest have told us theyre 
willing to consider lending Mr and Mrs W more money if they make a formal application for a 
further advance on their mortgage. Thats because NatWest need to assess whether Mr and 
Mrs W can afford to borrow more money. Mr W has suggested that the requirement means 
that they should get more compensation from NatWest. He says this shows the ongoing 
impact of what happened on him. Mr W has also suggested that NatWest commit to the 
terms of that lending now. 
I appreciate how unhappy Mr W is about what has happened, but I think that its reasonable 
for NatWest to say that Mr and Mrs W must formally apply for a further advance on their 
mortgage given NatWests obligation to lend responsibly. I also think its reasonable that 
NatWest consider Mr and Mrs Ws financial position at the time of that application. So I 
understand why it wont commit to the terms of that lending now.  
For completeness Ive also considered Mr Ws complaint about the valuation and the 
valuation fee. NatWest have accepted it was responsible for delays claiming the valuation 
fee and instructing its agent to carry out the valuation. It has apologised for this too. 
 
Taking this matter as a whole, I think the £400 compensation NatWest has agreed to pay Mr 
and Mrs W to resolve this complaint is fair and reasonable. It reflects the inconvenience they 
were caused as a result of the fault with its mortgage affordability tool, and the delays 
NatWest were responsible for in relation to the valuation. The £400 is line with the awards 
this service recommends in cases where business mistakes have had a significant impact on 
consumers. 
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above, my final decision is that the £400 compensation National 
Westminster Bank Plc has agreed to pay Mr and Mrs W to resolve this complaint is fair and 
reasonable. It should pay them this money if it hasnt already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W and Mrs W 
to accept or reject my decision before 28 December 2021.
