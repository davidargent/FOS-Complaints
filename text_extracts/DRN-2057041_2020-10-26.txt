The complaint
Mr Ks complaint is about Tesco Personal Finance PLC trading as Tesco Bank rounding up, 
to the nearest penny, a charge for a money transfer.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr K agreed to the terms and conditions of the account which say a fee will be 
applied for money transfers. In this case Tesco has correctly applied this fee to his 
transaction.
Mr K is unhappy that the fee was rounded up by Tesco to the nearest penny. He 
says this is unfair to customers and if the practice is applied to all customers Tesco 
will make a huge and unfair profit.
But that is Tescos practice. We arent a regulator and cannot interfere in Tescos 
practices and procedures or require it to change them.
Tesco said it hadnt done anything wrong but never the less it credited Mr Ks 
account with Â£10 compensation as a gesture of goodwill for the time hed spent and 
his call costs. Thats fair. 
Taking everything into account, although I recognise Mr Ks strength of feeling and 
frustration, I dont think Tesco has done anything wrong. And I dont think I can reasonably 
require it to do anything more or differently.
For these reasons I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Tesco Personal Finance PLC 
trading as Tesco Bank.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2020.
