The complaint
Mrs B complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to her the money that she paid for some 
holiday club accommodation. Shes being helped with her complaint by a representative.
What happened
Mrs B and her husband entered into an accommodation agreement in November 2014 for 
some holiday club accommodation. Mrs B paid the price of €4,600 using her Lloyds Bank 
credit card and £3,695.29 was charged to her account. Mrs B and her husband entered into 
a purchase agreement in July 2015 to buy some timeshare rights from the same holiday 
company. The purchase price for those rights was €7,000 which Mrs Bs husband paid using 
his credit card with another bank.
Mrs Bs representative, on behalf of Mrs B, made a claim to Lloyds Bank under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in October 2019. It said that the holiday company had 
misrepresented the products to Mrs B and her husband and was in breach of contract. 
Lloyds Bank didnt provide a substantive response to that claim so Mrs B complained to this 
service in February 2020. Lloyds Bank said, in March 2020, that it was sorry that it hadnt 
given Mrs B a better service and credited her account with £150 but that it had reviewed the 
information supplied and was unable to accept any section 75 liability as there wasnt 
enough evidence to support her claims. 
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
July 2015 timeshare agreement was a separate contract to the accommodation agreement 
and was paid, in full, by her husband using credit from a different provider so he only 
addressed Mrs Bs complaint about the declined claim for the November 2014 
accommodation agreement. He said that he didnt think that Lloyds Bank had acted unfairly 
when it decided not to uphold Mrs Bs claim under section 75. He also considered any claim 
that Mrs B might have under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but he didnt think that 
Mrs Bs relationship with Lloyds Bank was unfair. 
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that it disagrees with our adjudicators recommendation and has 
provided detailed comments in response. It says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
the July 2015 purchase was an upgrade of the accommodation agreement and not a 
separate purchase;
Mrs B was severely bullied into the purchase;
the holiday company offered Mrs B and her husband a scratch-card, didnt give them 
a 14 day cooling off period, said that the yearly maintenance fees would be £200 but 
sent them an invoice for £500 and they were unable to book any holidays;
they were shown a show apartment but the accommodation is in a very run down 
resort and wasnt of the standard shown to them; and
Mrs B was treated very poorly by Lloyds Bank  it didnt send her the statement that 
she requested, took too long to consider her claim and didnt take it seriously.
Mrs B says that our adjudicators recommendation is based on maybes, thinks, I 
believes and many more unsure comments, she has a valid dispute and, when she signed 
up with Lloyds Bank, she was assured that she would have protection.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our adjudicator that Mrs Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs B and her husband entered into an accommodation agreement in November 
2014 for one accommodation week in a two bedroom apartment in a specified hotel 
and four accommodation weeks in a two bedroom apartment in an establishment 
provided by the holiday company  the agreement had a duration of twelve months 
and no fees, other than the price of €4,600, would be charged;
they entered into a purchase agreement in July 2015 to buy some timeshare rights 
from the same holiday company for a specified apartment in a holiday club for week 
28;
Im satisfied that the accommodation agreement was a different contract to the 
purchase agreement - Mrs B has referred to it as it being a trial membership  and 
it had a duration of twelve months so would have ended in November 2015 (or earlier 
if Mrs B and her husband had used all of their accommodation rights and it may have 
ended when they entered into the purchase agreement);
Mrs B says that she paid a deposit of £3,695.29 using her Lloyds Bank credit card 
but the accommodation agreement was entered into in November 2014 and Mrs B 
made the payment to the holiday club in November 2014  the price under the 
accommodation agreement was €4,600 and theres no reference in that agreement 
to any deposit being payable so Im satisfied that the £3,695.29 that was paid by 
Mrs B was the price payable under the accommodation agreement;
Mrs B paid the €4,600 using her Lloyds Bank credit card and her husband paid the 
purchase price for the timeshare rights of €7,000 using his credit card with another 
bank  Mrs B didnt use her Lloyds Bank credit card to pay for the purchase price 
under the purchase agreement so Lloyds Bank would have no liability to Mrs B under 
section 75 for any breach of contract or misrepresentation relating to the purchase 
agreement and in this decision Im only considering Mrs Bs complaint about Lloyds 
Banks response to the claims that her representative had made to it, on her behalf, 
to the extent that those claims relate to the accommodation agreement;
if Mrs Bs husband wants to make a claim under section 75 relating to the purchase 
agreement, he should first make a claim to the bank that provided the credit card to 
him and then, if hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a 
complaint to this service;
Mrs Bs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);Mrs Bs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the agreement was misrepresented to her and her 
husband and that they wouldnt have entered into it if it hadnt been misrepresented 
to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Lloyds Banks response to 
Mrs Bs claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Bs representatives letter to Lloyds Bank in October 2019 lists the following 
issues: 
Mrs B and her husband werent given the correct information in writing;
they were offered scratch cards in the streets which was illegal;
the holiday company took a deposit on the day in contravention of law;
it promised Mrs B and her husband many things that didnt materialize; and
it was illegal to offer any kind of perpetuity clause;
its response to our adjudicators recommendation says that no cooling-off period was 
provided, the holiday company told them that the yearly maintenance fees would be 
£200 but sent them an invoice for £500, they were unable to book any holidays and 
they were shown a show apartment but the accommodation provided is in a very run 
down resort and wasnt of the standard shown to them;
the accommodation agreement describes the arrangement between Mrs B and her 
husband and the holiday company, and Ive seen no evidence to show that the 
information in the agreement is incorrect - so Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that they werent given the correct information in writing;
Mrs B and her husband were entitled to one accommodation week in a two bedroom 
apartment in a specified hotel and four accommodation weeks in a two bedroom 
apartment in an establishment provided by the holiday company  Ive not been 
provided with any evidence to show that the accommodation wasnt available to them 
or that the holiday company provided them with accommodation that was of a lower 
standard than had been agreed;
Mrs B and her husband entered into the purchase agreement with the holiday 
company in July 2015 and, if they hadnt received what theyd paid for under the 
accommodation agreement or had issues with the accommodation that had been 
provided to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have 
entered into the purchase agreement;
the accommodation agreement had a duration of twelve months so it wasnt in 
perpetuity and Im not persuaded that the holiday company was required to provide 
Mrs B and her husband with a 14 day cooling off period after theyd entered into it or 
that it had to wait 14 days before collecting payment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the accommodation agreement by the holiday company for which Lloyds Bank 
would be liable under section 75;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the accommodation agreement to Mrs B and her husband or that 
they were induced into entering into the agreement by any misrepresentations made 
to them by the holiday company;
some of the claims made by Mrs Bs representative relate to the potential unfairness 
of Mrs Bs relationship with Lloyds Bank as a result of the holiday companys actions so our adjudicator also considered Mrs Bs claims under section 140A which gives a 
court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by 
the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
the sale of accommodation by a holiday company isnt an activity that this service 
can investigate directly so Im unable to consider a complaint that the holiday 
company used a scratch-card promotion to entice Mrs B and her husband to a sales 
presentation and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that such 
a promotion caused Mrs Bs relationship with Lloyds Bank to be unfair;
Mrs B says that she and her husband felt pressured to enter into the accommodation 
agreement and her representative says that Mrs B was severely bullied into making 
the purchase - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mrs B and her husband were unduly pressurised into entering into the 
accommodation agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales 
practices against them;
if they were concerned that theyd been pressurised into entering into the 
accommodation agreement, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to 
have complained to the holiday company (or Lloyds Bank) soon after theyd signed it 
 but Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about those issues until 
Mrs Bs representatives letter to Lloyds Bank in October 2019, nearly five years later, 
and I also consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have then 
entered in to the purchase agreement in July 2015;
Mrs Bs representative says that Mrs B and her husband were told that the yearly 
maintenance fees would be £200 yet the holiday company sent them an invoice for 
£500 - but the accommodation agreement referred to the payment of €4,600 and 
said: No additional fees will be charged;
the invoice for the maintenance fees refers to the apartment identified in the 
purchase agreement and was dated in October 2015  after Mrs B and her husband 
had entered into the purchase agreement - and I consider it to be clear that the 
maintenance fees relate to the purchase agreement and not to the accommodation 
agreement;
Mrs B chose to use her Lloyds Bank credit card to make the payment of €4,600 to 
the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that her relationship with Lloyds Bank was unfair  nor do I consider it to be likely that 
a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and 
Lloyds Bank in these circumstances;
Mrs B has described her issues with the service that she received from Lloyds Bank 
in response to her claim and Lloyds Bank apologised that it hadnt given her a better 
service and credited her account with £150  I consider that £150 was fair and 
reasonable compensation for its delay in responding to her claims and the other 
issues that shes had with its service and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to pay her any more compensation for those issues;
it also said that it had reviewed the information supplied and was unable to accept 
any section 75 liability as there wasnt enough evidence to support Mrs Bs claims 
and I consider that its response to her claim was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mrs B and her husband for the stress that theyve experienced and 
the other issues that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable 
in these circumstances for me to require Lloyds Bank to refund to Mrs B the £3,695.29 that she paid to the holiday company, to pay her any further compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2023.
