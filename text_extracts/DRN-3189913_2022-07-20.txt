DRN-3189913
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) provided him with incorrect 
information over the phone, which resulted in his account going overdrawn.
What happened
Around October 2021, Mr D telephoned NatWest to enquire about his balance being higher 
than he anticipated. NatWest confirmed the balance to be genuine, but Mr Ds account later 
went into overdraft. Mr D complained to the bank because he had to borrow money from 
elsewhere. He also thinks that the bank shouldve had a marker placed on his account 
because of his circumstances and believes this wouldve led to a different experience during 
this telephone call.
NatWest confirmed that Mr D was given accurate information over the phone and pointed to 
a pending payment that was claimed by a retailer around the time  resulting in Mr Ds 
account going overdrawn. NatWest added that a marker on Mr Ds account wouldnt have 
affected the information he was given over the phone. 
Mr D remained unhappy and asked this service to independently review his complaint. One 
of our investigators decided that NatWest had acted fairly. Mr D didnt agree and asked for a 
final decision  he wants NatWest to pay compensation and reimburse him for his costs. So 
the complaint has been passed to me for a final review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my opinion, NatWest has acted fairly  Ill explain why.
It seems at the time that Mr D telephoned NatWest, a payment of around £700 was pending. 
NatWest says that the funds hadnt been claimed by the retailer and the pending payment 
amount was made available in Mr Ds account. So the advice he was given over the phone 
was based on these funds being available in his account.
Shortly after the call, NatWest says that the retailer claimed the funds and this is what led to 
Mr Ds account going overdrawn. We asked NatWest for a detailed audit of Mr Ds account 
transactions around the time and, although the bank was unable to provide this, I find its 
explanation of what happened at the time plausible.
I say this because Mr D hasnt disputed the £700 payment as unauthorised. So I think its 
likely he was aware hed made a payment to the retailer in question and expected the funds 
to leave his account at some point.  NatWest also says Mr D had carried out some 
transactions via his mobile banking around the time of the call  this makes me think he had 
up to date access to his balance information. At the time of the call, it seems the funds 
hadnt left Mr Ds account yet, so NatWest acted fairly by confirming the funds in Mr Ds 
account were available funds.
I acknowledge that Mr D faced some difficulties after this and had to borrow money. But I 
cant instruct NatWest to cover any losses or pay compensation if I dont think it did 
something wrong here  and, as I said, I think the bank acted fairly.
Mr D thinks NatWest shouldve placed a marker on his account sooner and suggests he 
wouldve received a different level of service over the phone if this was the case. But I dont 
agree. Markers are used so NatWest can adjust the services it provides to support its 
customers based on their individual circumstances. The information Mr D asked about over 
the phone was factual information and, having listened to the call, there isnt anything that 
makes me think that NatWest shouldve adjusted the way it handled Mr Ds query. Im 
satisfied that NatWest provided a response to Mr Ds query based on the information 
available at the time.
In conclusion, NatWest provided accurate information to Mr D based on the information it 
had about his account at the time. So Im not holding NatWest responsible for Mr Ds 
account going overdrawn around the time.
My final decision
For the reasons above, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2022.
