The complaint
Mrs B complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) declined her request 
to increase the credit limit on her credit card by Â£1,000. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Barclaycard is free to decide what lending criteria to use and whether it increases the 
credit limit of a credit card. 
The credit card's terms and conditions say a credit limit increase will be subject to 
Barclaycard's approval. 
I've looked at Barclaycard's decision to reject Mrs B's request and I'm satisfied it was 
reasonable and in line with its lending criteria. I haven't found anything to show 
Barclaycard made a mistake when it declined Mrs B's request.
As I haven't found anything to show Barclaycard made an error, I'm not telling it to 
take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2020.
