The complaint
Mr M complains that Close Brothers Limited added a Â£340 acceptance fee to his agreement 
that he wasnt aware of and was too high given the amount of credit being supplied.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know it will disappoint Mr M, but I agree with the investigators opinion. Please let me 
explain why.
Mr M acquired his car under a conditional sale agreement. This is a regulated consumer 
credit agreement and as a result our service is able to look into complaints about it. 
Its for Close Brothers to decide whether they charge an acceptance fee and how much they 
charge, but I can understand that the administration costs a fee would be charged for would 
be roughly the same no matter how much credit was supplied. 
Mr M has told us he expected an acceptance fee but didnt think it would have been so high. 
The acceptance fee was explained in the pre contract credit information Mr M was given 
before agreeing to the contract and it was also clearly stated on the front page of the 
conditional sale agreement that Mr M signed.
I dont therefore think it would be fair to suggest Mr M hadnt been made aware of it and Im 
not persuaded that Close Brothers have done anything wrong here.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
