The complaint
Mr H complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly blocked his account, 
denied him access to his funds, and stopped several payments being made into the account. 
What happened
In January 2020, PayPal explained to Mr H that it had placed a permanent limitation on his 
account. PayPal said it had noticed activity inconsistent with its User Agreement, and so it 
would no longer be offering its services to Mr H.
PayPal also said it would withhold Mr Hs funds for 180 days, after which it would contact 
him about withdrawing money from the account.   
Unhappy with PayPals actions, Mr H brought his complaint to this service. Before this 
service started its investigation, PayPal sent its response to Mr H. 
In addition to what it had already said, PayPal added that Mr H had withdrawn the remaining 
funds from his account in July 2020. And, the level of risk associated with Mr Hs account 
activity is too great, so PayPal would no longer provide him with its services
Our investigator looked into the matter, and they didnt uphold the complaint. In short, they 
found: 
PayPal had made Mr H aware his activity was in breach of its Acceptable Use 
Policy
It isnt for this service to say what PayPal should say is acceptable activity. PayPal 
is a business which has procedures in place to determine what it finds as 
acceptable use of its products.
PayPal has acted in line with its account terms and conditions when restricting 
Mr Hs account 
PayPal hasnt acted unfairly by withdrawing Mr Hs account. As a business it can 
choose who it does business with in the same way its customers can.  
In response, Mr H doesnt think he has breached the terms and conditions of his account. He 
adds that no specific reason or evidence about what hes done wrong has been given.
Our investigator said that as PayPal had determined a breach of its processes took place, he 
had to consider if the terms of the account were applied fairly. And he was satisfied PayPal 
had done so.  
As Mr H remains unhappy with what our investigator said, the complaint has now been 
passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done that, Ive decided to not uphold Mr Hs complaint. I can see Mr H feels 
strongly about his complaint, and that my decision will no doubt disappoint him. So, Ill 
explain why. 
Its clear Mr H doesnt think he has breached the terms and conditions of his PayPal account.
Id like to assure Mr H that Ive very carefully reviewed the relevant terms of PayPals User 
Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy. Having done that I can see they allow PayPal to limit 
or close an account if it wishes to do so. 
PayPal has also explained what it was about Mr Hs account activity that led to them placing 
restrictions on it. After taking all of this into consideration, Im persuaded PayPal has acted 
fairly and reasonably in first restricting, and then closing, Mr Hs account. 
Mr H wants to know exactly what it is that he has done that led to PayPal taking this action. I 
can understand why Mr H wants to know this and why he feels strongly about it, but PayPal 
isnt obligated to do so. 
In saying the above, Im also mindful it is a matter of commercial judgement on PayPals part 
if it chooses to end its relationship with Mr H. So I cant say its done anything wrong. 
I note PayPal decided to hold onto the funds in Mr Hs account for a little over the 180 days it 
said it might hold onto them for. The relevant terms say PayPal may choose to do this. So, 
Ive next looked into whether PayPal exercising this discretion was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. And having done that, Im satisfied it was. 
Mr H says hes lost out on potential income as a result of PayPals actions and he wants his 
account to be re-instated. I appreciate this has likely affected Mr Hs business; but given Im 
persuaded PayPal acted fairly when restricting and then closing his account, the loss of any 
income is an unfortunate consequence. 
PayPal is entitled to decide who it has a business relationship with and whether it wishes to 
end that  in the same way Mr H was able to. So I wont be directing PayPal to reinstate the 
account.  
 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2021.
