The complaint
Mr H complains about two logbook loans provided to him by CarCashPoint limited, 
(CarCashPoint) which he says were unaffordable.
What happened
CarCashPoint provided Mr H with log book loans. These loans were granted on the basis 
that Mr H provided CarCashPoint with a bill of sale for his car. This meant that if Mr H didnt 
make his loan repayments, CarCashPoint could potentially recoup its losses through the 
sale of the vehicle. 
I looked into whether these 2 loans were given to Mr H fairly. The details are as follows:

1 £1200 09.02.2019 78 £40.31 £3144.18 Outstanding
2 £500 11.03.2019 156 £14.75 £1801.00 Outstanding
Mr H says the loans were unaffordable and shouldnt have been given to him.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2021. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
As set out above, CarCashPoint gathered some information from Mr H about his income 
and expenses before it agreed the loans.
Did CarCashPoint carry out proportionate checks?
As Ive already mentioned, Ive seen how CarCashPoint asked about Mr Hs financial 
circumstances for both loans, but Im not satisfied that these checks went far enough on 
either occasion. For loan 1, I dont think CarCashPoint did enough when it checked Mr Hs 
expenditure. It asked Mr H for bank statements, but he didnt provide them and instead 
showed it his partners statements. Mr H told it he didnt have a bank account but has since 
told our service that he didnt want to disclose his statements to CarCashPoint. I have 
thought about this, and dont think that it could have reasonably relied on the statements 
provided by Mr H regarding his partners account to give an accurate reflection of what he 
was paying at that time. The statements provided gave little detail about regular financial 
expenditure, and I think CarCashPoint should have asked for more information about this. I 
say this because the loan term was over 78 weeks and I think it needed to ensure that the 
weekly repayments were sustainable over this long period of time. 
I can see that CarCashPoint carried out the same checks and used similar information for 
loan 2 as well. This loan was to be over a longer period of 156 weeks and was to run 
alongside loan 1 and so it follows that I make the same conclusion that it should have carried 
out further checks to ensure that Mr H could afford to make the higher repayment and for 
longer.
For the above reasons, I consider CarCashPoints checks should have included a full review 
of Mr Hs financial circumstances, including further verification of his expenditure so it could 
ensure that the loan repayments were affordable or if Mr H. So, I dont think the checks it 
carried out for either loan were proportionate.
What would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown?
I need to think about what CarCashPoint would have seen if it had carried out proportionate 
checks. Our adjudicator asked Mr H to provide his bank statements from around the time he 
applied for the loan. Im not suggesting here that this is the check that CarCashPoint should 
have done and I do acknowledge that Mr H told it that he no longer had an account. But I 
think looking at the bank statements he has now provided would give me the best picture of 
what the lender should have seen if it had asked for more.
I have reviewed Mr Hs bank statements that covered the period of time before and up to the 
point he took loans 1 and 2. There is not a lot of expenditure on these statements and I can 
only see a small number of low value gambling transactions along with a couple of payments 
to the County Court. These payments on their own wouldnt suggest to me that Mr H was 
struggling to manage his finances or that the loan repayments were unaffordable for him at 
the time each loan was granted.   
In conclusion, I do think CarCashPoint should have carried out better checks when it agreed 
to lend to Mr H on both occasions. But based on what I have in front of me, including the 
additional information provided by Mr H, I dont think the loan repayments were unaffordable 
for him at the time he was granted the loan. So, I am minded to conclude, that further checks 
wouldnt have shown that CarCashPoint lent irresponsibly to Mr H.
So, for the reasons set out above, Im currently not upholding Mr Hs complaint.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response 
to my provisional decision. CarCashPoint has not responded by the deadline given.
Mr H responded on 10 June 2021 and disagreed with my provisional decision. He said 
he downplayed his outgoings so he would be more likely to be accepted for the loan. He 
says if CarCashPoint had questioned what he told them (that his partner paid the 
majority of the bills) then it would have uncovered what he was actually spending on his 
expenditure and not given him the loans. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H says CarCashPoint should have done more to find out what Mr Hs expenditure 
actually was. If it had done this, Mr H says, it would have seen that he couldnt afford the 
loans. He says if they had looked further they would have seen where the money was 
actually going. 
I have already considered what Mr H has raised within my provisional decision and within it 
I concluded that CarCashPoint didnt carry out proportionate checks for either loan and 
should have done more. This is because I didnt think the information it obtained showed enough about Mr Hs expenditure. On seeing his partners statements, I think it ought to 
have asked for more about Mr Hs expenditure. 
Mr H says that if it had done more it would have seen that he couldnt afford the 
repayments on these two loans. But he hasnt provided enough evidence to show that this 
was the case at the time the loan was granted. The statements he provided recently to our 
service show very little, at least not enough that show me that the loans would be 
unaffordable or the repayments unsustainable for him. 
I know this will be a disappointment for Mr H and I acknowledge the comments he has 
made, but on this occasion, I am not persuaded to change the outcome of his complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2021.
