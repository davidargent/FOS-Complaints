The complaint
Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr S says that Sunny should have known he couldnt afford the lending. He had to 
borrowing further to make the loan repayments. This resulted in Mr S getting into a cycle of 
debt.

When Mr S complained to Sunny, as a gesture of goodwill, it wrote off the outstanding 
balance on Mr Ss loans  14 to 16  totalling £706.39.
The complaint was considered by two of our adjudicators. In the most recent assessment 
our adjudicator concluded the complaint should be partially upheld and thought the loans 
from loan five onwards shouldnt have been given as it appeared Mr S was having problems 
managing his money and was becoming persistently reliant upon this type of credit. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan ten onwards. We put this 
offer to Mr S, but he wasnt willing to accept it. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr S didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr S had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Like the adjudicator, I think Sunny should have had concerns about whether it was right to 
lend to Mr S when he returned for further borrowing at loan five. At this point loans two to 
four were still outstanding so his repayments were correspondingly getting higher and were 
an increasing proportion of his income. Mr S was getting further into debt with Sunny. 
Mr S had repaid loan one only three days before. Loan five was more than double the 
amount he had previously borrowed - £500 compared to the highest amount he had 
borrowed before of £200. So, I think Sunny should have considered whether Mr S was 
having problems managing his money effectively. And I note that loan two was repaid four 
days after loan five was given which further suggests that Mr S was juggling his finances in 
order to keep on top of his debt. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out eight loans within six months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 Mr Ss first loan was for £200 and loan eight was for £350.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known that Mr S was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
From loan eight onwards Mr S was often provided with a new loan within weeks of 
settling a previous one. 
 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 16 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Ss first. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 16 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
 
A. Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, not including anything Sunny has already 
refunded.
 
B. Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by     
Mr S which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
 
C. Sunny may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal 
which Sunny has written off.
 
D. Sunny should pay any remaining refund to Mr S. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written off principal, it would not be fair for Sunny to 
pursue this further.
 E. Sunny should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Ss credit file in
relation to loans five to seven. The overall pattern of Mr Ss borrowing for loans eight
to 16 means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should
remove these loans entirely from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
