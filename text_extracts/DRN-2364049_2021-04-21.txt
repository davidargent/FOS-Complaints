The complaint
Ms D complains that as a result of incorrect information provided by Moneybarn No. 1 
Limited (Moneybarn) she entered into an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) that she 
might have otherwise not entered into or paid more into it than she might have otherwise 
paid.
What happened
In late 2014 Ms D entered into a conditional sale agreement (agreement) with Moneybarn 
to fund the acquisition of a car. The cash price of the car was £8,087.99. Everything else 
being equal Ms D undertook to make an advance payment of £400 followed by 47 monthly 
payments of £311.71  making a total repayable of £15,050.37 at an APR of 43.9%.
In October 2015, and due to arrears accumulating, Moneybarn terminated the agreement.
In February 2018 Ms Ds debt was recorded in Moneybarns books as £9,149.49.
In May 2019, following a review of Ms Ds debt, Moneybarn reduced the sum due and owing 
in its books by £5,147.98. This was done because Moneybarn accepted it hadnt done a 
good enough job in communicating to Ms D, in October 2015, the best agreement exit option 
available to her. And had it done so, her balance due and owing in February 2018 in its 
books would have been £4,001.51 rather than £9,149.49.
Ms D, due to her level of indebtedness, entered into an IVA. Her IVA was approved by her 
creditors (including Moneybarn) on 23 April 2019. A completion certificate in respect of the 
same was issued on 23 December 2019.
The sums initially claimed by Ms Ds 16 creditors (including Moneybarn) was £31,307.30. 
However, this was reduced to £26,159.32 after Moneybarn reduced its claim to £4,001.51 
from £9,149.49.
Ms D paid £11,000 into her IVA representing approximately 35% of what she understood 
she owed her 16 creditors (£31,307.30). However, after Moneybarn had reduced its claim 
Ms Ds payment of £11,000 ended up representing approximately 42% of what she owed her 
16 creditors (£26,159.32).
The sum of £11,000, having been reduced by various fees and disbursements to £8,887.63, 
was paid out to Ms Ds 16 creditors at a dividend rate of 33.975p in the pound. This meant 
Moneybarn received £1,359.51.
Ms D complained to Moneybarn, then our service, that had Moneybarn advised her sooner 
than 17 May 2020 that she owed it £4,001.51, rather than £9,149.49, she may havent 
entered into an IVA, or instead she may have paid less than £11,000 into it.
Ms Ds complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it 
shouldnt be upheld. In summary she said:
She wasnt persuaded that Ms D entered into her IVA simply on the strength of the 
sum of £9,149.49 Moneybarn says she owed it and which it initially claimed under 
her IVA.
Moneybarn only received 33.975p in the pound of its reduced claim of £4,001.51 and 
not 33.975p in the pound of its first and higher claim of £9,149.49.
She wasnt persuaded that Ms D would have paid less than £11,000 into her IVA had 
she been aware her total indebtedness was £26,159.32 rather than £31,307.30.
Even had Ms D made a lower offer to her creditors under her IVA, there is no 
guarantee that such an offer would have been accepted by them.
Ms D didnt agree with the investigators view. In summary she said:
The only reason she entered into the IVA was because of what Moneybarn initially 
said she owed it, this being £9,149.49.
The Moneybarn debt was the only debt recorded with credit reference agencies as 
being in default.
Moneybarn was aware before the creditors meeting that the debt in its books was 
overstated by £5,147.98.
However, she went onto say that she was prepared to accept a lower sum than £5,147.98 to 
settle her complaint.
The investigator considered Ms Ds response to her view but wasnt persuaded to change 
her mind. Therefore, the complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I can confirm that Ive come to the same conclusion as the investigator and 
for the same reasons. 
Its clear Ms D has very strong feelings about this complaint. She has provided detailed 
submissions in support of her view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Ms D will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I would also add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory, 
as some of its here, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Now I accept that Moneybarn would have known, or should have known, prior to the 
creditors meeting on 23 April 2019 that Ms Ds debt would be caught by its account review. 
But I find Moneybarns submission that it wasnt until after 23 April 2019 that it undertook a 
review of Ms Ds account and established it should be reduced (and by how much) to be 
both plausible and persuasive. Therefore, I find that Moneybarn wouldnt have known prior to 
23 April 2019 that the balance of Ms Ds debt in its books was overstated by £5,147.98.Ms D says that the only reason she entered into the IVA was because of what Moneybarn 
told her she owed it. Now I accept I cant say for certain Ms D would have still entered into 
her IVA had Moneybarn told her, before 23 April 2019, that she owed it £4,001.51 rather 
than £9,149.49. But on the balance of probabilities Im persuaded she would have done. Ive 
come to this conclusion given, amongst other things, that Moneybarns £5,147.98 reduction 
in its claim under Ms Ds IVA represents only 16% of the initial claim (from all 16 creditors) of 
£31,307.30.
Ms D also says that even had she still entered into an IVA, had Moneybarn claimed only 
£4,001.51 under it at the outset rather than £9,149.49, she would have paid less than 
£11,000 into it. Again, I cant say for certain Ms D wouldnt have paid less than £11,000 into 
her IVA had Moneybarn claimed only £4,001.51 under it at the outset rather than £9,149.49. 
But on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded she would have done. In my view 
Ms Ds offer of £11,000 would have been made regardless of what she understood she 
owed her creditors. Put another way, its my view that Ms D had calculated £11,000 was 
what she could afford to pay her creditors and whether such an offer represented 35% or 
42% of what she owed wouldnt have been, on the balance of probabilities, material to her 
decision making. Furthermore, and as noted by the investigator, there is no guarantee that 
an offer of less than £11,000 would have been acceptable to Ms Ds 16 creditors.
I appreciate Ms D will be disappointed but given what I say above I find that Moneybarn 
doesnt have to pay her anything by compensation in respect of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
