The complaint
Ms H complains that she was offered a loan by Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118
Money at a time when she was in financial difficulty. 
She says the loan was unaffordable and
shouldnt have been lent.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 12 June 2023 where I set out my 
preliminary findings and why I was inclined to reach different conclusions from the 
adjudicator. 
My provisional decision should be read in conjunction with this decision as it forms part of 
my final decision.
I gave both parties an opportunity to respond to my provisional decision. The deadline for 
responses has now passed. 
Neither Ms H nor her representatives responded, and 118 118 Money responded to say it 
had nothing further to add.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reconsidered the available evidence in this complaint, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional findings. 
118 118 Moneys reasonable checks didnt suggest Ms H would struggle to repay the loan 
and so I dont think it was wrong to lend.
So, I wont be asking 118 118 Money to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2023.
