K821x#15complaint
Mr F has complained about a number of loans he took out through  a company called Uncle 
Buck Finance LLP. Mr F says he was lent to irresponsibly and this contributed to financial 
problems. To keep things  simple, Ill refer mainly to Uncle Buck in this decision.
background
We now know that Mr F took out 14 loans from Uncle Buck  between  October  2014  and May 
2018. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Fs borrowing with Uncle  Buck, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
Im very sorry this has taken  a while to get to this stage. Most  recently,  one of our 
adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld because  
none of loans should have been provided to Mr F. Uncle  Buck didnt agree with that view but 
it had previously offered  a part-settlement, which Mr F declined to accept. For these reasons 
the complaint  has come  to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Fs 
complaint.
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr F could  repay the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Uncle Buck  should  have  fairly and reasonably done more  to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So Uncle  Buck was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay the loans,  not just whether the repayments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN22542832Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr F 
could sustainably make  the repayments.  But it doesnt automatically  follow  that this is the 
case. This is because  the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Uncle Buck  told us it carried out certain checks before agreeing  to lend to Mr F, including 
assessing his income,  expenditure  and creditworthiness.  It says that the information  it had, 
showed that Mr F would  be able to sustainably make the loan repayments  he was 
committing to. But I dont  agree with this. 
For example, we asked  Uncle Buck to show us details  of the actual checks and searches it 
carried out at the point  of loan 1, a payday  loan due to be paid back in full at the end of the 
same month. I think the results of these checks clearly showed Mr F had 4 other  short-term  
loans outstanding. And because the combined repayments on these loans would have  
caused Mr Fs outgoings to exceed his earnings,  I dont  think it was responsible to lend him 
any money. 
I note that in addition to this, the checks showed  Mr F also had other unsecured loans 
outstanding so I think any reasonable assessment of his financial affairs would have easily  
shown that he was having a lot of difficulties managing  his money.  In essence, loan 1 was 
unaffordable for Mr F.
It doesnt look like Uncle Buck did anything in reaction  to this information such  as verifying if 
Mr Fs self-declared outgoings were correct. It was obviously open to Uncle Buck  to use this 
information to take a closer look at his finances  which would have shown he was also 
heavily overdrawn.  Our experience of short-term  lending tells us that consumers  who have 
difficulty managing  their money are less likely to be able to sustainably  repay  loans. I 
therefore dont  think Uncle  Buck ought to have  lent Mr F the money for loan 1.
Loans 2 - 5 in my view only add further  weight  to exactly the same argument because  these 
followed loan 1 in a back-to-back fashion  over the following  months, whilst Mr Fs financial 
predicament remained the same. Again therefore, agreeing  to these loans was irresponsible 
and harmful to Mr Fs financial  situation.
In addition to all this, I think an emerging pattern  of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 
was also very clear.  Hed borrowed 6 times in 9 months and the amounts he was given  
broadly increased  so he wasnt  making  any in-roads into his indebtedness. It doesnt  look 
like Uncle Buck did anything differently, but this pattern  should  have caused it to see that 
Mr F wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he was borrowing 
regularly, to address  shortfalls in his income  and to meet  an ongoing need. Mr F was having 
to consistently  take out high interest,  short-term lending over a sustained  period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was also harmful. 
So Im also upholding  the complaint in respect  of loans 6 -14 too because:
 
Ref: DRN22542833these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use, over an extended time period; 
and
the length of time over which Mr F borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
Uncle Buck  has said that at various points the loan chain was broken i.e. there was a gap in 
the lending, specifically between loans 10 and 11. It also said the amounts being  lent to him 
decreased. However,  I dont agree  there was any form of significant gap because  by loan 10 
the lending relationship was already 2 years old and I note there were two further  (declined) 
applications after loan 10 and before loan 11 was eventually granted.  To me this depicts an 
ongoing financial relationship. Neither do I agree that lending  decreased:  there was an 
obvious upward  trend in the lending as shown by the table below.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr F, Uncle Buck should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  1- 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any negative information  about loans 1  5 from Mr Fs credit  file;
the information recorded  about  loans 6 - 14 are adverse. So all entries about loans 6 
- 14 should be completely removed from Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck  to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr F a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Fs complaint and I Uncle Buck Finance LLP to put things right for Mr F as set 
out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020.
