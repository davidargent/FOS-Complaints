The complaint
Mrs L complains that Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) collected the full direct debit 
payment for her credit card after she made manual payments to reduce the outstanding 
balance. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Halifax's credit card terms and conditions say it won't reduce the payment it collects 
after the statement date. That meant that even though Mrs L had made payments to 
reduce the outstanding balance, Halifax still collected the payment it quoted in the 
previous statement. 
I'm satisfied Halifax's reliance on the credit card terms is fair and reasonable. 
Halifax is entitled to decide how it collects credit card payments and I haven't seen 
any evidence it made a mistake or treated Mrs L unfairly in this case. 
I'm satisfied Halifax refunded the credit balance in good time and dealt with Mrs L's 
complaint fairly.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2020.
