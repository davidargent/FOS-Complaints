DRN-2750779
The complaint
Ms B complains that she was migrated in 2016 from a fee-paying packaged bank account to 
a Current Account with Tech and Travel Packs (CATTP) and charged a monthly fee for it by 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays). She says she didnt want or use the benefits of the 
CATTP.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our adjudicator for the following 
reasons. Ive looked at the letters Barclays says it sent before and after the migration of Ms 
Bs account to the CATTP, and in my view the letters make clear what is happening and 
what her options are, including the option of having an account with no fees.
Ms B says she didnt receive them. However, two letters were sent to the address which 
Barclays had on record, which was correct at the time. And in my view, although postal 
services can fail, I cant say its more likely than not that Ms B didnt receive either letter.
Also, I would not expect Barclays to treat her any differently at her age, as she suggested it 
might, unless Ms B had told Barclays she had a special need. And Ive not seen any 
evidence that Ms B did so. 
So, although I know she will be disappointed, I cant uphold Ms Bs complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold Ms Bs complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or reject my decision before 
17 October 2021.
