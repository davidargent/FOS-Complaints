The complaint
Mrs A complains that NewDay Cards Ltd (NewDay) increased the APR on her card without 
giving her notice. She says shes in financial difficulties but that NewDay wont discuss it with 
her and that shes received poor customer service.
What happened
Mrs A opened a credit card account with NewDay in January 2018. She says she noticed the 
interest rate had increased when she received her November 2020 statement and the 
minimum payment was higher than shed expected. She told NewDay she was experiencing 
financial difficulties and couldnt afford the payments. And she felt that, during the Covid 
pandemic and when the Bank of England interest rate was so low, that her interest rate 
should have reduced. She says she was told not to make the payment due in November 
2020, but she was then charged a late payment fee.
NewDay said it had acted in line with its terms and conditions in raising the interest rate. It 
said it had written to Mrs A in August 2020 to give her notice of the change and to give her 
the option of closing the account for future use and repaying the remaining balance at the 
existing interest rate. It referred her to its customer care team if she was experiencing 
financial difficulties.
Mrs A phoned NewDay to tell it a bit more about her financial difficulties. She was told not to 
make the November payment if she couldnt afford it and was asked to provide details of her 
income and expenditure. She didnt make the payment and she didnt provide the requested 
details. Her account went into arrears and she was also charged a late payment fee.
Towards the end of December, NewDay agreed Mrs A did not need to make any payments 
for six months. But Mrs A decided she didnt want her credit file impacted, so she continued 
to make the required payments.
She complained about the late payment fee charged in November  when shed been told 
not to make the payment. NewDay didnt find it had made a mistake, but it refunded the fee 
as a gesture of goodwill.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He concluded that 
NewDay had raised the interest rate in line with the agreed terms and conditions and that it 
had sent Mrs A notice of the change. He thought clearer information should have been 
provided to Mrs A about the consequences of not making a payment. But that NewDay had 
compensated her by refunding all the late payment fees from October 2020 and that no 
adverse information had been recorded on her credit file.
Mrs A didnt agree. She said NewDay had recently admitted it was at fault and had 
compensated her.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I find I have come to the same conclusion as our investigator for the 
following reasons:
NewDay acted in line with its terms and conditions when it made the decision to increase the 
APR on Mrs As credit card account.
NewDay provided Mrs A with the required notice of the interest rate change. It wrote to her in 
August 2020, and it provided information on her September and October statements.
NewDay gave Mrs A the option to close her account if she wasnt happy with the new 
interest rate. She would then have been able to repay the existing balance at the existing 
interest rate. 
Im satisfied that the letter and statements were correctly addressed. This means I cant hold 
NewDay responsible if Mrs A didnt receive them, or if she over-looked them.
I can see that when Mrs A phoned NewDay she was told not to make the November 2020 
payment if this would worsen her financial difficulties. But NewDay also told Mrs A about the 
consequences of not paying, including the impact on her credit file.
In February 2021, NewDay told us that all charges had been refunded, no information had 
been recorded on Mrs As credit file and that the account was fully up to date. So I cant 
conclude its treated Mrs A unreasonably or unfairly.
I can see that, since referring this complaint to us, Mrs A has raised a separate complaint 
with NewDay which it upheld. The complaint is about what happened in July 2021 which 
does not form part of the complaint that has been referred to us and so I cant comment on 
it.
I am not unsympathetic to the position in which Mrs A found herself in 2020 and the financial 
difficulties shes experienced. But, for the reasons Ive explained, I dont find NewDay did 
anything wrong and I dont require it to take any further action.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2022.
