The complaint
 Mr C is unhappy with National Westminster Bank Plcs decision to close his account. Mr C 
is also unhappy that hes had a default registered against him due to an overdraft linked to 
the account which was closed.
What happened
 Mr C held a current account with NatWest where he was using an overdraft. 
In March 2017, NatWest wrote to Mr C and let him know that his account may be closed if he 
didnt make a suitable arrangement to repay his overdraft.
In March 2019, Mr C set up a repayment plan with NatWest which was agreed.
Later in March 2019, NatWest carried out a review on Mr Cs accounts and decided they no 
longer wanted him as a customer. NatWest gave Mr C 7 days notice to close his account 
but didnt give him a reason and referred him to the account Terms and Conditions. 
In April 2019, NatWest wrote to Mr C and explained that as the account had been closed, 
they couldnt accept the payment plan  and asked Mr C to pay his overdraft in full. The 
letter also explained that if the balance wasnt cleared, a default will be applied.
Mr C complained to NatWest and they didnt uphold his complaint  he referred it to our 
service.
The investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly. He explained they were entitled to 
close the account in line with the Terms and Conditions. And he thought it was reasonable 
for them to apply a default due to the overdraft not being paid in full.
Mr C disagreed. In particular he said that he didnt receive the Terms and Conditions of the 
account. And he explained that NatWest kept changing their mind about the payment plans 
 and more specifically that he didnt ever receive the default notice.
The investigator responded to Mr C and explained that Mr C would have agreed to the 
Terms and Conditions when he opened the account  and said that NatWest had provided 
evidence to show theyd sent him a default notice. As an agreement couldnt be reached, the 
complaint has been passed to me.
In June 2021, I issued a provisional decision. In it, I said;
Account closure
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and 
existing relationships. Banks sometimes choose to end their relationship with customers. 
This can be due to a number of reasons  and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the 
customer. Just the same as if Mr S decided to stop banking with NatWest, he wouldnt have 
to tell them why. 
While NatWest are entitled to close customers accounts  they must do so in line with the 
Terms and Conditions. I appreciate Mr C says he wasnt aware of the Terms and didnt 
agree to them. But I cant fairly agree with him here. When Mr C opened his account with 
NatWest, he confirmed hed read and understood the Terms and Conditions of the account.
Ive reviewed the Terms and Conditions and Im satisfied that NatWest acted fairly when 
giving Mr C 7 days notice to close his accounts  so I cant fairly say theyve acted 
unreasonably.
This service wont generally intervene in a banks commercial discretion. NatWest exercised 
their right to longer offer Mr C banking facilities and Im satisfied with their reasons why. Im 
sorry I cant share those reasons with Mr C directly but Ive seen nothing to suggest NatWest 
has made an unfair decision. So I wont be asking them to do anything differently.
The default
I appreciate Mr C was using an overdraft provided by NatWest  and days before NatWest 
decided to close his account, theyd agreed a repayment plan with him. I appreciate Mr C set 
up this repayment plan in an attempt to repay the monies owed to NatWest. No doubt it 
would have been difficult for Mr C to find out that not only was his account closing, but 
around a week afterwards, that NatWest would no longer honour the repayment plan. 
NatWest sent Mr C a letter and asked him to repay his overdraft in full  otherwise theyd 
apply a default.
Firstly, Im aware that Mr C has told us he didnt receive the default notice. But NatWest 
have provided us with evidence to show that they sent it. Therefore, I cant fairly hold 
NatWest responsible if Mr C didnt receive it.
However, what I think is important here is that Mr C had a sizeable overdraft facility of 
around £4,000. Ive also reviewed Mr Cs bank statements and it seems that he was often 
using his overdraft since around March 2016 and rarely in credit. The times Mr C has been 
in credit its only been for a number of days  never a full month.
Overdrafts are repayable on demand and therefore I can understand why NatWest asked Mr 
C to repay it when they decided to end their banking relationship with him. However, Ive 
also recognised that Mr C has made ongoing and extensive use of a very large overdraft 
facility for a long period of time.
The FCA has recently recognised that repeat use of overdraft facilities over a prolonged 
period of time can be a sign of financial difficulties, and it has put in place steps banks must 
follow to reduce ongoing reliance on overdrafts which have been in use for some time. 
I havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest had taken steps to make sure that Mr Cs 
circumstances didnt constitute actual or potential financial difficulties. But even if they had, I 
would still say that it was unreasonable for NatWest to then ask Mr C to pay this overdraft off 
entirely, within an extremely short time frame. I think it must be likely that Mr C had become 
reliant on this facility, and for that reason I think that it was unreasonable for NatWest to take 
away the repayment plan from Mr C and demand he pay back his overdraft immediately. I 
think NatWest should have allowed Mr Cs repayment plan to continue  or discussed an 
alternative plan with him to allow him to repay his debt over a reasonable period of time, with 
no interest or other fees, and without defaulting his debt.
Its important Mr C understands that its usual for a default to be registered on a credit file 
once a debt is between three and six months in arrears. Therefore, if Mr C isnt in a position 
to repay his debt in full over the next agreed timeframe for the repayment plan, then he may want to consider keeping the existing default in place to avoid further disruption to his credit 
file.
In summary, while I agree NatWest have been fair in closing Mr Cs account  I dont think 
their demand of repayment for the overdraft was reasonable. I think NatWest should discuss 
an alternative repayment plan with Mr C. The repayment plan should start from the date of 
my final decision and give Mr C a reasonable, and affordable timeframe to repay the debt. 
And if Mr C isnt able to pay during this agreed time, I find NatWest would be able to default 
this debt again.
Mr C has told us that this default has caused him severe distress. I havent seen any 
evidence of that  but I do think the service NatWest has provided Mr C when recalling the 
debt has been poor. And therefore, I think they should also pay him £200 compensation. I 
find it reasonable for NatWest to offset this amount against the outstanding debt if they feel it 
appropriate to do so.
So, I thought NatWest had been reasonable in their actions when closing Mr Cs account  
but not when they recalled the overdraft immediately and registered a default against Mr C. 
So, I thought they should allow Mr C a reasonable amount of time to repay the funds and 
pay him £200 compensation. 
Mr C responded to my provisional decision and agreed with it. NatWest responded and 
didnt have any further comments to add.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so, my decision hasnt changed. Mr C accepted the decision and NatWest 
didnt have any further evidence or arguments. And therefore, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional findings. 
In summary, while I agree NatWest have been fair in closing Mr Cs account  I dont think 
their demand of repayment for the overdraft was reasonable. 
Putting things right
 NatWest should discuss an alternative repayment plan with Mr C. The repayment plan 
should start from the date of my final decision and give Mr C a reasonable, and affordable 
timeframe to repay the debt with no interest or other fees. And if Mr C isnt able to pay during 
this agreed time, I find NatWest would be able to default this debt again. Therefore, I must 
stress to Mr C that if he doesnt think hell be in a position to repay the debt in the newly 
agreed timeframe he may want to consider leaving the current default in place to avoid any 
further disruption to his credit file and finances.
Im satisfied that the £200 compensation is a fair way to recognise the distress caused to 
Mr C. But as he still owes an outstanding balance, NatWest are entitled to offset this amount 
from the current owed balance.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint. To put things right National Westminster Bank Plc should:
Remove the current default from Mr Cs credit file.
Discuss an alternative repayment plan with Mr C.
Pay Mr C £200 compensation (which can be offset against the outstanding balance) 
for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
