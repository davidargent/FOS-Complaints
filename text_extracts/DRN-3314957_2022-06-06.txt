The complaint
Mrs B complains that AIB Group (UK) plc, trading as First Trust Bank, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid for a timeshare. Shes being represented by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs B and her husband entered into a purchase agreement to buy a timeshare in September 
2012. The total price of the timeshare was £6,800 and Mrs B used her First Trust Bank credit 
card to pay a deposit of £1,360 in October 2012. She agreed to then make 12 monthly 
payments of £453.33 using the same credit card.
Mrs B claimed a refund from First Trust Bank under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. It said that Mrs B and her husband had clearly bought a timeshare and there was no 
breach of contract or misrepresentation so it declined her claim. Mrs B wasnt satisfied with 
its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld and the complaint 
was then considered by one of our adjudicators but the outcome that he recommended was 
the same as the investigators. He didnt think that the timeshare had been misrepresented 
or that First Trust Bank had acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold the claim under 
section 75. He also said that he believed that it was unlikely that a court would conclude that 
the timeshare companys actions generated an unfair debtorcreditor relationship.
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided detailed further comments and says, in summary and amongst 
other things, that:
the timeshare company failed to comply with the Timeshare, Holiday Products, 
Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010;
the timeshare was misrepresented to Mrs B and her husband;
the timeshare was sold to them as an investment;
the evidence provided to First Trust Bank, including the witness statement from 
Mrs Bs husband, has been largely uncontested and it hasnt provided a witness 
statement; and
the timeshare companys training manuals havent been provided.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator and our 
adjudicator for these reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances and in complaints such as this one, where the 
evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I have to make my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have 
happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances;
Mrs Bs complaint is about First Trust Banks response to her claim under section 75 
for a refund of the money that she paid for the timeshare;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Bs complaint about First Trust Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare company 
and that First Trust Banks response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Bs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs B and her husband signed the purchase agreement for the timeshare in 
September 2012 and her husband has provided a detailed witness statement 
describing what he says happened leading up to them signing the agreement and 
whats happened since then;
I consider it be clear from the agreement that they were buying a timeshare on the 
terms set out in the agreement and in the agreement conditions;
the timeshare company also sent a letter to them which provided further information 
about the timeshare that they were buying, including that accommodation was 
subject to availability and that it couldnt guarantee a return to the same unit but 
would offer another unit at the resort of similar size and type;
Mrs Bs representative says that timeshare was sold to Mrs B and her husband as an 
investment and its clear that theyve had difficulties in selling the timeshare  I 
sympathise with them for those difficulties but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the timeshare was sold to them as an investment or that those 
issues show that it was mis-sold to them;
Mrs Bs husband has described the way that the timeshare was sold to them but Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unduly 
pressurised into entering into the purchase agreement or that the timeshare company 
used unacceptable commercial practices against them  they didnt complain to First 
Trust Bank about the way that the timeshare had been sold to them until after theyd 
tried to sell the timeshare and, if they were concerned about the way that the 
timeshare was sold to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to 
have complained to First Trust Bank about those issues earlier than they did; 
this service has gained considerable knowledge about the timeshare industry and its 
sales practices and Im not persuaded that theres any requirement for the timeshare 
company to provide a witness statement about what happened or to provide its 
training manual;
Im not persuaded that any failure by the timeshare company to fully comply with the 
timeshare regulations in these circumstances is enough to constitute a breach of 
contract for which First Trust Bank would be liable under section 75 and nor am I 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare company;I consider that First Trust Banks response to Mrs Bs section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances;
our adjudicator also considered whether there was an unfair relationship between 
Mrs B and First Trust Bank in these arrangements - section 140A gives a court the 
power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the 
debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
I consider that Mrs Bs claim to First Trust Bank was made under section 75 and 
didnt include a claim under section 140A so I make no finding as to whether the 
relationship was unfair  but from what I have seen I dont consider it to be likely that 
a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and First 
Trust Bank;
Mrs Bs husbands witness statement says that the timeshare company didnt ask 
them about their income and expenditure or check that the monthly instalments were 
affordable  but Ive seen no other evidence to show that the timeshare was 
unaffordable for Mrs B or that she complained to First Trust Bank that it was 
unaffordable for her before August 2016  and that was nearly three years after shed 
made the last of the monthly instalments for the timeshare; and
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that she and her husband have had with the 
timeshare and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require First Trust Bank to refund to 
Mrs B any of the money that she paid for the timeshare, to pay her any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2022.
