The complaint
Mr C complains that Lloyds Bank plc (Lloyds) didnt update his address details leading to a 
financial loss. He would like to ensure his details are now correctly recorded. And to receive 
more compensation than Lloyds has already paid.
.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons :-
I appreciate it must have been really frustrating for Mr C for it to have taken 
approximately five months for Lloyds to update his address details. I understand the 
details have now been correctly recorded.
Mr C has told us the delay in getting his address details correctly recorded impacted 
on him getting work as he needed evidence of his home address from a bank 
statement . However, I am not sure why he couldnt have used other documentation 
to prove his home address. He hasnt given us any evidence to show only a bank 
statement would do. And I also dont know if he was able to do other work during this 
time. So, I dont think its fair to expect Lloyds to cover any possible loss of earnings. 
Lloyds has refunded the cost of  Mr Cs phone calls (£18) and I think it has  
acknowledged the distress and inconvenience caused in  paying a total of £180 for 
the distress and inconvenience. I think this is a fair amount of compensation to have 
paid. And I see no reason for Lloyds to pay any additional compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
