K821x#15complaint
Mr O says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 23 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr O between  March 2017 
and April 2018. Mr Os borrowing history is summarised at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Os complaint and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as they thought the pattern of borrowing indicated  Mr O was 
reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but later agreed to uphold from loan 
13 onwards instead.  Mr O hasnt responded to Sunnys offer.  But as the complaint was 
already waiting for a final decision,  it was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr O could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN85434172Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Os complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 3. Mr O 
didnt respond  to the view. As there appears  to be no dispute with the adjudicators opinion 
about these loans, I won be making further  findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Mr O and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Os fourth loan in under two months, I think  
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Os finances  before 
lending to him again.
At the time Mr O applied  for loan 4, loans 1, 2 and 3 remained  outstanding.  And whilst each 
of these loans  were instalment ones so the monthly  repayment  was less, having  to repay 
four amounts was increasing Mr Os monthly  outgoings. And I think this should have caused 
some concern to Sunny,  as it might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone 
was facing problems  managing their money and needing to borrow more  on a regular basis.    
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr O was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr O had taken out nine loans within six months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr Os indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Os first loan was for £150  and loan 9 was for the same amount.  At  this point Sunny 
ought to have known it was likely Mr O wasnt borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in 
his income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From loan 9 onwards Mr O was provided with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out the 
previous one. 
Mr O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 23 was taken 
out `3 months after Mr Os first. Mr O had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN85434173I think that Mr O lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number  of loans and the length of time over which  Mr O borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Os ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr O paid on loans 4 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework any outstanding  loans applying all payments made  by Mr O as if they went  
towards the principal  amount borrowed. But importantly, Sunny needs to make sure 
that it collects  no more  than the principal sum lent. 
If and when  the amount Mr O has paid exceeds  the amount he was lent, any further 
amounts paid should be treated  as overpayments. Any overpayments  that may have 
been made  should be refunded to Mr O with 8% simple  interest from the date the 
overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
if there  is still an outstanding  balance,  any refunds should be used  to repay  any balance 
remaining on the outstanding loan. If there is any surplus  this should be repaid to Mr O.
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Os credit  file in relation to loans 4 to 8. 
the number of loans  taken from loan 9 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries  about loans  9 to 23 should be removed from  Mr Os 
credit file. You do not have to remove any outstanding  loans from Mr Os credit file until 
these have  been repaid, but any adverse information recorded about these loans should 
still be removed.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr O a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr O still has an outstanding balance due on any of his loans, then 
Sunny should  try and work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan in 
order to repay what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Mr O fairly. 
Ref: DRN85434174my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
