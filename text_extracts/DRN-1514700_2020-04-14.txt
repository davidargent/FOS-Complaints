DRN-1514700
The complaint
Mr D says American Express Services Europe Limited mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mr D bought the policy in 2011 at the same time as taking out a credit card online. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr D disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ds case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ds complaint for the following reasons.
The online application had a box to tick if Mr D wanted PPI. So, I think American Express 
made Mr D aware that he had a choice about buying the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
American Express didnt recommend the PPI to Mr D so it didnt have to check if it was right 
for him. 
Its possible the information American Express gave Mr D about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr D doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didnt cover  and based on what I know about his circumstances it looks like the 
policy couldve been useful to him. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped him 
buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ds comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2020.
