Mr P complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent money to 
him that he couldnt  afford to repay.
background
Based on the information provided, Mr P took out 12 loans with Sunny between June and 
November 2016.

Mr P says that at the time of the Sunny loans  he had loans with a number of other  short term 
loan providers. He says his situation got so bad he had to apply for a Debt Relief  Order.  He 
says the loans were  provided irresponsibly as he couldnt afford  the repayments.
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  it carried out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks and considered how Mr P was managing his debt. It says based on the 
results of these checks it was reasonable that the loans were provided.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that there was enough to say that loans one to six shouldnt  have 
been provided. However she thought  that by the time loan seven was provided, Mr Ps 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested he had become  persistently  reliant  on short-term 
loans. She thought that loans seven  to 12 werent  sustainable.
Sunny didnt accept  our adjudicators view.  It said that Mr P was required to pay an average 
of 4.15% of his monthly income to make his contractual repayments. It said that the nature of 
its product allows  customers flexibility as to how they borrow and they can take up to four 
loans at a time. It says having multiples loan at one time doesnt  mean  that the lending was 
unsustainable. 
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN99747292Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income  and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
I have looked  through  the information that Sunny gathered before the loans were provided 
and also considered the repayments amount, totalling up the repayments where multiple  
loans were taken out in parallel. I also note that loan six was for a lower amount than the 
previous loans. Based on this I agree with our adjudicator that there isnt enough to say that 
loans one to six shouldnt have been  provided. 
However loan seven was the seventh loan in less than three months. While I note the 
comments that have  been made about  the nature of Sunnys product, I find that Mr Ps 
lending pattern should have raised  concerns. Seven loans  in such  a short  period suggested 
Mr P was struggling to manage his money and was likely taking out new loans in order  to 
make other repayments. Mr P continued to borrow  from Sunny until September 2016 and the 
amount he was borrowing wasnt reducing significantly. 
Ref: DRN99747293Overall, I think Mr Ps pattern  of borrowing itself demonstrates that the lending was 
unsustainable from loan seven onwards.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complain  in regard to loans seven to 12. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr P towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans seven to 12, including payments made to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  that has already been refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr P which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr P originally made  the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) pay Mr P the total of "A" plus "B".
D) the overall pattern  of Mr P's borrowing  from loan seven  onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so all information about these loans should be removed 
from Mr P's credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires tax to be deducted from this interest. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny)  should give Mr P a certificate  showing  how much 
tax its deducted,  if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 November 2019.
