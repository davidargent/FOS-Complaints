The complaint
Mr G has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused to allow him to 
keep an overpayment it paid into his account and then removed. 
What happened
The main facts behind this complaint are not in dispute. In summary, several years ago, 
NatWest mis-sold Mr G a packaged bank account. Mr G complained, NatWest upheld his 
complaint and refunded the fees he had paid for the account, plus interest. This was in line 
with what we normally tell banks to do if they mis-sell packaged accounts. However, 
NatWest overpaid the amount due to Mr G by more than £500. (The overpayment). Both 
parties now agree that this was an error on NatWests part. 
On the day NatWest sent the money to Mr G, he spoke to it on the phone to check the 
amount and it said that the total amount, including the overpayment, was correct. However, 
on the same day NatWest discovered its error and took the overpayment back from Mr Gs 
account. It didnt tell him it had done so.
Still on the same day, Mr G tried to buy some goods at a high-street store using a debit card 
for his NatWest account, but his payment was rejected as he had insufficient funds. Had 
NatWest not taken back the overpayment, there would have been enough money to pay for 
Mr Gs intended purchases. 
After Mr Gs payment had been rejected, he again spoke to NatWest who again said the 
original total amount (including the overpayment) was correct. But it didnt return the 
overpayment. 
Mr G complained to NatWest. He wanted it to return the overpayment to him. Instead, it paid 
him £30 for his inconvenience. It later increased this to £100 in total by paying him a further 
£70. 
One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mr Gs complaint and didnt recommend that 
NatWest should return the overpayment to him. Mr G didnt agree. He asked for an 
ombudsman to review his case. So, it has come to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the facts of this case are well established, the only point I have to decide is whether the 
NatWest should return the overpayment to Mr G.
Clearly NatWest made an error with the overpayment and then compounded matters by 
misleading Mr G about it twice. However, it seems to me that the money concerned never 
properly belonged to Mr G. Despite NatWests error, it always owned the money it had 
overpaid. I do not think it would be right for me to tell NatWest to give the overpayment back 
to Mr G. 
Had Mr G lost out financially due to NatWests error, then it would have been fair for 
NatWest to return him to the financial position he would have been in if it hadnt got things 
wrong. However, apart from the cost of some phone calls, Mr G doesnt seem to have lost 
out. 
I understand that NatWest caused Mr G some inconvenience, and probably some 
understandable frustration, but I think the payment it has made to him for this inconvenience 
is ample and is also sufficient to cover the likely cost of the phone calls. I dont think NatWest 
owes Mr G any more money. 
My final decision 
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mr Gs complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc. I not going to tell it to give him any money back
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
