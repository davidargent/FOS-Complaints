The complaint
Mr T complains that he paid for a 48 hour courier service and didnt get this. 
He wants PayPal to refund him the money that he paid for this courier service. 
What happened
Mr T said that he bought a 48 hour courier service for a parcel that he wanted delivering. He 
paid for the service online through PayPal and said that when he clicked on Buy now he 
was told that the parcel would take 72 hours to be delivered instead. 
He bought the service on a Monday and the parcel was collected on the following Thursday. 
But it wasnt delivered until the next day, Friday. 
Mr T complained to PayPal, as he was entitled to under PayPals user agreement because 
the payment for the courier service was made through them. He asked them to refund the 
£22.65 thatwhat he had paid for the service. PayPal refused to refund this amount as they 
claimed that Mr T had received his goods. 
Mr T wasnt happy with this outcome, so he came to us. 
Our investigator found that the courier service had made it clear that their timings were 
approximate so Mr T couldnt rely on his parcel being delivered in 48 hours. So, PayPal 
didnt do anything wrong in not refunding Mr T the £22.65. She also said that the way that 
PayPal had handled the complaint didnt change her decision. 
Mr T said that the courier service had advertised a 48 hour delivery and that is what he 
shouldve got. So, the complaint has now come to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr T requested PayPal a refund here refund his money because he paid for the courier 
service using PayPal. PayPals user agreement states that buyers who have used PayPal it 
to make purchases can raise a dispute under its Buyer Protection scheme where the seller 
hasnt
 delivered the goods which have been paid for; or delivered goods which are "significantly 
not as described". 
When they PayPal talks about goods, this includes services. This is probably why PayPal 
repeatedly referred to Mr Ts goods being delivered. But I can see how this wouldve been 
annoying frustrating for Mr T as he paid for a service rather than goods. 
Once a dispute is raised (as Mr T did), PayPal will investigate whether the service was what 
it was supposed to have been. If they it decides that it wasnt, they it may refund the money 
paid for it. So, this is why we are looking at the complaint. 
I can understand Mr Ts frustration at what has happened. He clearly thought that he was 
getting a 48 hour courier service and it was important to him that the parcel he was sending 
got to the recipient by Friday morning. This didnt happen. Then, on top of this, he dealt with 
making a complaint to PayPal where he said that they it kept asking him if he was now being 
happy that his goods had been received. This suggested to him that PayPal didnt 
understand the complaint. 
But, Im afraid that I dont think that PayPal need to refund the cost of the courier. Let me 
explain my decision.
I say this because PayPal has looked at the Ive read through the relevant parts of courier 
services terms and conditions. They state that the courier service:
shall use all reasonable endeavours to adhere to the intended transit times which 
are approximate only and as such, time for delivery, is not of the essence of this 
agreement and the parties agree that failure to meet anticipated collection and 
delivery times may be down to a number of variables. You acknowledge and agree 
that [the courier service] shall not be liable to you in respect of any losses incurred by 
you in respect of a delay.
Mr T agreed to these terms and conditions when he bought the service. They clearly say that 
they might not get a parcel delivered in 48 hours even if that is what has been ordered so, 
effectively, what Mr T was paying for was to have the parcel delivered. And it was. 
So, I think that PayPal is acting fairly when it can says that they it wont refund Mr T his 
money because the parcel was delivered. Thats a decision its made in line with what the 
User Agreement says and one that I think is fair in the circumstances here. Also, while there 
may have been some small issues with how PayPal dealt with the claim, theres nothing that 
makes me think PayPal needs to take any further action in respect of the impact these had 
either.
I know that this isnt the outcome that Mr T hoped for, but I hope hell understand why Ive 
reached this decision.
 and Im sorry for this.
My final decision
I think that the terms and conditions of the courier service stated that the timings were 
approximate so I dont think that the 48 hour service could be relied upon. So, I dont require 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to do anything else.  My final decision is that I dont uphold 
this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2022.
