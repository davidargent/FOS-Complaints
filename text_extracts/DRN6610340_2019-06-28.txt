K821x#15complaint
Mr H has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr H says he couldnt afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out.
background
QuickQuid agreed 12 short-term loans for Mr H between August 2012 and October 2015. 
Each loan was repayable over between one and three months,  with the exception of loans 6 
and 7. Loans 6 and 7 were flexible credit  agreements (flex-credit).  These were credit facilities 
that allowed  Mr H to draw down money  up to a pre-agreed credit limit, with a view to 
repaying it  potentially over a period  of up to 10 months.
Several of Mr Hs loans  were topped  up, sometimes on more than one occasion. This is 
where Mr H took out further borrowing under the same agreement,  before paying  back the 
initial amount  borrowed.  Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Hs complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loans  1  2 and 
loans 8  10 were proportionate;  but he thought the checks on loans 3 - 7 and loans  10  12 
were not.
Ref: DRN66103402He thought that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks on these loans, it wouldve 
likely concluded that loans 3  7; and loans 11 - 12 wouldve  appeared to have been 
unaffordable for Mr H, and therefore,  as a responsible lender, QuickQuid would not have 
agreed to them. He also thought from the checks QuickQuid did carry out, it shouldve 
concluded that loans 8b and 10a werent  affordable either. 
Mr H accepted the adjudicators findings and raised  no new arguments in response to the 
opinion. QuickQuid however, accepted the findings regarding loans 3  7 but it disagreed 
with the adjudicators findings on the remainder of the loans. So it offered to refund the 
interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3 - 7 only. 
Mr H rejected QuickQuids counter offer. So as no agreements been reached  at this stage, 
the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. As the only loans that now 
remain in dispute  are loans 8b, 10a, 11 and 12, my decision will focus on these loans only.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate checks when  Mr H 
applied for his loans.  It said that when reviewing these loan requests, it considered  the 
information obtained from credit checks and the information provided on Mr Hs loan 
application. It said it also reviewed data from identity verification  sources  and the Office of 
National Statistics for Mr Hs area.  And  based on the results  of these checks, it saw no 
reason to believe Mr H would be unable to honour  the proposed repayments for these loans. 
The adjudicators opinion, set out in detail why he thought  Mr Hs case should be upheld  in 
part, and this is summarised above. QuickQuid,  in response to the adjudicators opinion, said 
amongst other things,  that starting 1 March 2015, it had implemented an affordability review 
that was consistent  with the FCA (Financial Conduct  Authority)  Handbook and was in place 
at the time it received  authorisation  by the FCA. And that its assessment was conducted 
properly and individually for each of these applications after this date.
QuickQuid has raised  this generic argument across  many cases  brought  to our service. And 
this service has addressed this  specific point by QuickQuid  in several previous decisions, so I 
wont expand on it any further  here.  As by now, QuickQuid will be aware  that my role is to 
look not only into the rules  and regulations  set by the regulator  at the time of borrowing, but 
also the law, good industry  practice  and all the available evidence and arguments, to help 
decide whether  I think what  the business  has done is right or not. So my decision will focus  
on the specifics of Mr Hs complaint and what  both parties have said about  this.
Having looked  at this case,  I dont think QuickQuid was right to provide Mr H with loans 8b, 
10a and loans  11  12 (including  the top ups on loan 12). Ill explain why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and Mr Hs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
Ref: DRN66103403the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Hs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr H would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr H would have been  able to do so?
Loan 8 was originally for £100.  Mr H topped-up this loan by a further £50 a week later on 
8 June 2015 (loan 8a), and then again on 10 July 2015 by a further £75 (8b) taking the total 
capital sum borrowed  to £225.
At this time QuickQuid recorded Mr Hs monthly income as £1,683 and his monthly 
expenditure as £1,350. So from its own checks, QuickQuid wouldve seen that Mr H had a 
disposable monthly income in the region of £333.
Loan 8b was due to be repaid over two months,  and the highest repayment  on this loan was 
£266. So while its possible  Mr H may have had a small sum of money left over after 
repaying the credit  Im not persuaded that the amount Ive identified  was sufficient for him 
to be able to repay it in a sustainable  manner. So I think QuickQuid was wrong  to have 
agreed to loan 8b. 
Loan 10a was a similar situation. QuickQuid again recorded Mr Hs monthly income  as 
£1,683, and his monthly  outgoings  as £1,350.  So his disposable income at this time was still 
around £333. And the highest monthly repayment due on loan 10b was £277. 
Ref: DRN66103404So again  for the same reasons as above, while its possible  Mr H may have had a small sum 
of money left over after repaying this credit   Im not persuaded that the amount Ive 
identified was sufficient  for him to be able to repay  it in a sustainable  manner. So again, I 
think QuickQuid was wrong to have  agreed to loan 10a. 
Loan 11 was taken out in April 2016  for £200, and this was Mr Hs fourth loan in the current  
chain of lending  after the gap I mentioned earlier. QuickQuid recorded Mr Hs income  as 
£1,705 at this point,  and his monthly outgoings as £1,350. 
But Mr H had now been borrowing regularly from QuickQuid for around 10 months.  So I think  
by now, given the volume of short-term credit hed been taking out, QuickQuid as well as 
looking into his regular  monthly income  and expenditure, shouldve  also enquired specifically 
into whether Mr H owed any monies  to any other  short-term lenders, to ensure he could 
maintain his repayments on this loan sustainably. 
Had it done so, I think  QuickQuid wouldve seen, that when it agreed loan 11, Mr H owed  
almost £390 to other short-term lenders, in addition to the £1,350 of outgoings he declared.  
So proportionate checks wouldve shown  QuickQuid that Mr Hs total monthly outgoings were 
actually closer to £1,740  a month,  which was more than his monthly earnings at the time.
So I think had QuickQuid  carried  out a full financial review as I think it shouldve,  it wouldve  
seen that Mr Hs outgoings were already exceeding  his income,  and he was in no position to 
commit to any further credit commitments  at this time. And as a responsible  lender, I dont 
think it wouldve agreed to loan 11 knowing this. 
Loan 12 was taken out in August  2016,  around  three  weeks  after loan 11 was settled, and 
this time Mr H borrowed £100. As Mr H had now been borrowing regularly from QuickQuid 
for over a year, I think by this point, QuickQuid shouldve been carrying out a full review of 
Mr Hs financial  circumstances,  verifying  the information it was given, to determine whether 
or not he was in a position to meet the repayments  on this loan sustainably.
Had it done so, I think  it wouldve seen that when  Mr H applied for loan 12, his monthly 
income was around  the figure  hed declared, just a few pounds less at £1,693. But it 
wouldve also seen that his regular monthly living costs were around  £1,420,  and that he 
owed a further £40 on his regular credit commitments, and another £208 to other  short-term  
creditors, taking his total monthly outgoings to around £1,670.  This amount, when deducted 
from his income, left Mr H with around  just £20 remaining, which  was insufficient to meet any 
repayments due on this loan. So again,  as a responsible lender, I dont think  QuickQuid  
wouldve agreed to this loan, or the top-ups on it, had it carried  out proportionate checks.   
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuid shouldve  agreed to loans 8b, 10a, 11 or 12 (including 
top-ups).
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive not gone onto assess the overall pattern  of lending at this stage, because I dont need 
to, as I already  think the loan that remains in dispute should not have been agreed.
3. Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some 
other way.  
Ref: DRN66103405what QuickQuid  needs to do to put things right
QuickQuid has already agreed  to refund the interest  and charges  Mr H paid on loans  3  7, 
so it should still do this. 
In addition to this I think QuickQuid was wrong to have approved loans 8b, 10a, 11 and 12 
for Mr H. So it needs to refund all of the interest and charges Mr H paid towards these. 
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3  7, loans 8b, 10a, 11 and 12, 
including the top-ups  on loan 12 (12a and 12b);
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
-remove any negative information  about these loans from Mr Hs credit  file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Hs complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
