K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Society of Lloyds  is responsible for poor service under a home 
emergency insurance policy.
background
The Financial Ombudsman  Service treats  complaints about insurance claims as complaints 
against the insurer responsible for dealing with claims. To prevent  third parties being 
identified, our published decisions dont use their names or brand names.
Mr C had a policy in the name of an insurance  intermediary.  A syndicate at Lloyds was 
responsible for dealing  with claims. Where  I refer to Lloyds or the insurer, I include the 
intermediary, call-handlers, engineers and others for whose actions I hold the insurer 
responsible.
The policy terms (bearing  a date in October  2016) include separate sections 1, 2 and 3 
covering respectively damage to the central heating system (excluding the boiler),  damage  
to the central  heating  boiler and boiler  replacement. 
Mr C lives in a large barn conversion. He returned home and on 5 December 2017 reported  
that his circulating pump had malfunctioned and damaged the boiler.  So he asked  the 
insurer for help. The insurer  said it would replace the boiler but not the pump. 
Mr C complained that the insurer should  reimburse his costs of paying  privately  for a new 
boiler and pump. The new boiler, new pump  and new valves  together  cost Mr C £2,719.69.
our adjudicators opinion
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She thought  that the 
insurer wouldnt be required to reimburse the costs Mr C incurred for the replacement boiler, 
as the insurer  didnt authorise the replacement. As he wouldve been entitled to a 
replacement under the policy, the insurer would only be obliged to pay Mr C the cost it would 
have incurred had it arranged the replacement.  The insurer had evidenced it wouldve 
incurred a cost of £2,042.39 had it replaced  the boiler, including  the pump. It therefore, 
wouldnt be required to contribute any more than this. In addition to this, the insurer  had paid 
Mr C £100.00 towards  the cost of his heating and reimbursed an invoice to the value of 
£9.69. In the circumstances, the adjudicator considered this to be fair and reasonable and 
she considered  the insurer  had fulfilled  its obligations to Mr C.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr C 
and to Lloyds  on 9 August 2019.  I summarise  my findings:
On 15 December 2017 Mr C bought  a pump  valve for £9.69  but I think  that was 
plus VAT making a total of £11.62.
The final response  letter also offered £9.69  for the pump valve. But it shouldve  
offered to reimburse  the VAT- inclusive amount of £11.62.
Ref: DRN45924342I was minded to find it fair and reasonable that the insurer reimbursed Mr C the 
£2,042.39 it wouldve paid for the new boiler and new pump.  The insurer offered that 
reimbursement in its final response letter on 29 June 2018. But there had already 
been delay and it didnt make the payment until 9 July 2018.  So I was minded to find 
it fair and reasonable to direct  the insurer to pay interest at our usual rate on that 
amount from 21 December 2017 to 9 July 2018. 
The final response  letter also confirmed an earlier offer to pay £10.00  per day for the 
running costs of ten days of temporary  heating  between 5 and 15 December  a total 
of £100.00. Mr C hadnt provided  any evidence  of any greater costs. So I was minded 
to find that fair and reasonable.  But there  had already been delay and the insurer  
didnt make the payment until 16 July 2018.  So I was minded to find it fair and 
reasonable to direct  the insurer to pay interest  at our usual rate on that amount from 
15 December 2017 to 16 July 2018.
The final response  letter also offered to consider the cost of purchase  of temporary 
heaters. Mr C provided receipts  and the insurer  paid £16.96  on 23 July 2018. So I 
was minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct the insurer  to pay interest at our 
usual rate on £16.96 from 15 December 2017  to 23 July 2018.
The insurer  was responsible for a few days of delay in the period 5 to 15 December 
2017. This caused Mr C some extra distress and inconvenience at an already difficult 
time for him. Later it caused him further  distress and inconvenience by delay and 
shortcomings in its communications about  his complaint. So I was minded to find it 
fair and reasonable to direct the insurer to pay him £200.00 for distress and 
inconvenience.
Subject to any further information from Mr C or from Lloyds,  my provisional  decision was 
that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct  Society  of Lloyds to:
1.pay Mr C £1.93 for VAT on the pump valve; and
2.pay Mr C simple interest at a yearly  rate of 8% on each of the following amounts for 
each of the following periods:
2.1 on £9.69 from 15 December 2017 to 16 July 2018; and
2.2 on £1.93 from 15 December 2017 to the date of payment; and
2.3 on £2,042.39 from 21 December 2017 to 9 July 2018; and
2.4 on £100.00 from 15 December 2017  to 16 July 2018; and 
2.5 on £16.96 from 15 December 2017  to 23 July 2018; 
Ref: DRN459243433.If the insurer considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold 
income tax from that interest, it must tell Mr C how much  its taken off. It should also 
give him a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from 
HM Revenue  & Customs if appropriate;  and
4.pay Mr C £200.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Mr C disagrees  in part with the provisional decision.  He says, in summary, that:
In effect the insurer reneged on the contract  by not responding to his imposed 
deadline of 14 December 2017 to agree  a way forward.  
The insurer was originally intent on replacing  his failed boiler  with a less costly boiler. 
This added three  days delay. The insurers agreement  to replace the boiler like-for
like was not communicated  to him until 15 December.
The insurer was proposing to supply a pump quoted at a VAT- inclusive cost of 
£317.88. The pump he obtained,  at retail price, was £310.00  inclusive of VAT. 
By refusing to repair his system, the insurer  had broken the contract. So he is 
seeking reimbursement and compensation out with the policy constraints, thus 
restoring him to the status quo that existed before  the insured incident.  
An analysis of the email  and document trail on or around  20 to 28 June 2018 reveals 
admissions that the policy wording was deficient  on the matter of the commercial 
status of a 180mm type circulating  pump.  
Lloyds were sufficiently unsure of their case as to agree that the pump  cost should  
be refunded as a gesture of good  will. 
The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulatio ns 1999 provid e that a term 
which  is not written in plain and intelligibl e language shall be interpreted in favour of 
the consumer because  he did not draft it. 
A later version of the policy wording  almost completely removed the term domestic.
An email on 29 June 2018  at 1413  to various recipients at Lloyds implies that the 
insurer didnt inform  Mr C that his system wouldnt qualify under the policy.
There is no evidence that the insurer was prepared to allow the system restoration 
including the pump replacement.  
The insurer continued to refuse to replace the faulty  pump and hence  restore the 
system. 
This whole matter has taken up at least 60 hours  of Mr Cs time.
He seeks  reimbursement for the full costs  that he incurred for the boiler  and 
compensation for his time.
Lloyds agrees with the provisional  decision,  which it equates to £298.13.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From what  Mr C has said, someone installed his boiler in January 2009. From the insurers  
file, I think Mr C first took out the policy in January 2012. The policy terms may have changed 
over the years.  I think the relevant terms are those dated October 2016.
Section 1 (central heating system)  excludes  all parts internal and external to the boiler. I 
interpret that to mean all parts of the boiler whether  internal  or external (because they are 
covered by Section 2).
Ref: DRN45924344Section 2 includes the following:
We will pay for Damage to Your gas fired domestic  central heating boiler as stated in the 
Policy Schedule, including its integral controls,  thermostats,  frost thermostats, circulating  
pump
The insurer  has made much of the word domestic . But it appears in a coverage clause not 
in an exclusion clause.  And I dont think the word domestic  is enough to exclude  parts  of a 
home boiler  (such as pumps) that are light commercial. So I dont need to refer to consumer 
legislation.
Sections 1 and 2 were together subject to a limit of £2,000.00.
Section 3 (boiler replacement) was also subject to financial  limits.  In  the case of a boiler  that 
was  when the policy was first taken out - up to seven years  old, the limit was £2,500.00.
In the context of an agreement  between a consumer and an insurance  company I find that 
the financial limits include  VAT.
The insurer  arranged a visit on about  6 December. After that, the insurer referred to Mr Cs 
faulty pump as external. It also said it wasnt domestic. 
By about 12 December,  the insurer considered that the boiler was beyond  economic repair.
From an invoice, I see that on 14 December 2017,  Mr C bought a pump for £310.00. From 
another invoice  I see that on 15 December 2017 Mr C bought a pump valve  for £9.69  but I 
think that was plus VAT making a total of £11.62.
The insurers  file includes costings dated  15 December 2017 as follows:
boiler: £1123.8 +Vatflue  £73.64  +Vat180  pump and Valves  £264.90 +Vat Total 
materials cost £1462.39 +Vat Labour Boiler - £500 + Labour Pump   2 additional  hours Total 
Labour cost £580  +Vat Overall Total cost £2042.39
I accept that the costings  included not only a like-for-like boiler  but also the circulating pump. 
But I dont think the insurer gave Mr C the detail of those  costings.  
And a call recording on 15 December  shows that the insurer maintained  its position  that  
whilst it would replace  the boiler   it wouldnt replace the pump. I think  the policy  covered the 
pump under Section  2. And the situation was an emergency. So Im not satisfied that the 
insurer treated Mr C fairly by declining  to replace the pump. I think  the insurer shouldve 
recognised that the policy covered the pump as part of the boiler.
Also on 15 December 2017 the boiler manufacturer  independently  of the insurer  repaired  
Mr Cs boiler.  
From the call recording, Mr C was satisfied that the system was working. So I find that Mr C 
or the boiler  manufacturer installed the pump on or before  15 December. Mr C declined  the 
insurers offer to replace the boiler.
But in the boiler failed  again and Mr C says the boiler manufacturer waived its charges.
Mr C paid privately for the installation - on about 21 December   of a new boiler. Ive seen the 
invoice for £2,400.00. It doesnt mention a new pump. So that reinforces my view that the 
pump had already been replaced.
Having replaced  the pump, Mr C didnt go back to the insurer for a new boiler. If he had done 
so, Im satisfied that the insurer wouldve installed a like-for-like new boiler. Im satisfied that 
wouldve cost the insurer £2,042.39 - less the cost of the pump and its installation.
Therefore I find it fair and reasonable  that the insurer - in its final response  letter  on 29 June 
2018 - offered to reimburse Mr C £2,042.39. 
But there had already  been delay and it didnt  make the payment until 9 July 2018. So I find it 
fair and reasonable to direct the insurer to pay interest at our usual rate on that amount from 
21 December 2017 to 9 July 2018. 
The final response  letter also confirmed an earlier offer to pay £10.00  per day for the running 
costs of ten days of temporary heating between 5 and 15 December  a total of £100.00. Mr 
C hasnt provided  any evidence of any greater costs. So I find that fair and reasonable. 
But there had already  been delay and the insurer didnt make  the payment  until 16 July 2018. 
Ref: DRN45924345So I find it fair and reasonable to direct the insurer to pay interest at our usual rate on that 
amount from 15 December 2017 to 16 July 2018.
The final response  letter also offered £9.69  for the pump valve. But I think  it shouldve offered 
to reimburse the VAT- inclusive amount  of £11.62.  So I find it fair and reasonable to direct  the 
insurer to pay the difference  of £1.93. 
And the insurer didnt  pay the £9.69  until 16 July 2018. So I will direct  it to pay interest  at our 
usual rate on £9.69 from 15 December 2017 to 16 July 2018 and on £1.93 from 15 December  
2017 to the date of payment. 
The final response  letter also offered to consider the cost of purchase  of temporary heaters. I 
think Mr C provided receipts and the insurer paid £16.96 on 23 July 2018. So I find it fair and 
reasonable to direct  the insurer to pay interest  at our usual rate on £16.96 from 15 December 
2017 to 23 July 2018.
Finally, I think  that the insurer is responsible for a few days of delay in the period 5 to 15 
December 2017.  This caused Mr C some extra distress and inconvenience  at an already 
difficult time for him. Later it caused him further distress and inconvenience by delay and 
shortcomings in its communications about  his complaint. So I find it fair and reasonable to 
direct the insurer to pay him £200.00  for distress and inconvenience.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Society of Lloyds  to:
1pay Mr C £1.93 for VAT on the pump valve; and
2pay Mr C simple interest at a yearly  rate of 8% on each of the following amounts 
for each of the following  periods:
2.1 on £9.69 from 15 December 2017 to 16 July 2018; and
2.2 on £1.93 from 15 December 2017 to the date of payment; and
2.3 on £2,042.39 from 21 December 2017 to 9 July 2018; and
2.4 on £100.00 from 15 December 2017  to 16 July 2018; and 
2.5 on £16.96 from 15 December 2017  to 23 July 2018; and
3If the insurer considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold 
income tax from that interest, it must tell Mr C how much  its taken off. It should 
also give him a tax deduction certificate  if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs  if appropriate; and
4pay Mr C £200.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Ref: DRN45924346Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 October  2019.
