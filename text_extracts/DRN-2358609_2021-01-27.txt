The complaint
Mr B complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that hes claimed as a result of some work on his car.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B used his Barclaycard credit card in January 2020 to pay £522.20 to a garage for 
an MOT test and replacement brakes pads and tyres for his car;
he says that the work took much longer than hed been told that it would and the next 
day the drivers door lock wasnt working properly;
he returned the car to the garage for the lock to be repaired and was charged a 
further £183.35 which he also paid for using his Barclaycard credit card;
he says that the door was damaged when the car was returned to him and hes been 
quoted £999.55 for the repair;
he claimed a total of £1,714.15 from Barclaycard under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 and the chargeback rules (which is the £522.20 and £183.35 that he 
paid to the garage, the £999.55 quoted for the repair and bus fares of £9.05);
it said that a chargeback for the money paid to the garage wasnt available because 
Mr B had had the work done and it didnt agree that the garage had breached its 
contract with him or that there had been a misrepresentation;
Mr B complained to this service but our investigator didnt think that Barclaycard had 
acted unfairly in how it handled Mr Bs section 75 claim or in not raising a 
chargeback;
he has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and says that the 
service he received is definitely below the standard he was entitled to as the garage 
caused further damage to the cars door and interior leather which will cost him 
£999.55 to have repaired and a huge amount of inconvenience in terms of alternative 
travel arrangements and time lost;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
the garage had tested the car, replaced its tyres and brake pads and then repaired 
the door for Mr B and I dont consider that there was any basis on which a 
chargeback claim would have been successful  so Im not persuaded that 
Barclaycard acted incorrectly in these circumstances when it didnt make chargeback 
claims for the £522.20 and £183.35 that Mr B had paid to the garage;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Bs complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the garage and that 
Barclaycards response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mr B clearly feels that the garage misrepresented the time that the work would take 
and that it damaged the drivers door lock and then damaged the door when it 
repaired the lock so its breached its contract with him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the drivers door lock 
was damaged when the first work was being done on the car  that work was an 
MOT test and replacement tyres and brake pads and I dont consider it to be likely 
that the garage would have damaged the drivers door lock when doing that work  
and Mr B didnt notice the issue with the drivers door lock until the day after hed 
collected the car so he would have used the drivers door when he collected the car;
its clear that theres a dent in the cars door but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the dent was caused by the garage;
its also clear that the first work took longer than had been expected  but Im not 
persuaded that thats enough to amount to a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the garage;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
garage in these circumstances or that Barclaycard has responded to his claim for a 
refund under section 75 or a chargeback incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclaycard to refund to 
Mr B any of the money that hes claimed, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2021.
