DRN-4129375
The complaint
O, a limited company, complains that HSBC UK Bank PLC wont pay it an agreed charges 
refund. HSBC closed Os bank account in 2021, so it thinks HSBC should transfer the 
money to a directors personal bank account instead.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
 Im satisfied HSBC hasnt deprived O of a charges refund. I can see it offered to pay 
it £77.43 on 30 August 2022 and explained that all it required was Os payment 
details. I can also see that the option to accept this payment remains open to O, 
should it provide the requested information.
 It's unfortunate the refund only came to light after Os bank account with HSBC had 
closed. Its my understanding that HSBC completed an internal review in July 2022, 
and this included considering the charges that were applied to Os account. I also 
note that HSBC included interest when calculating the £77.43 refund amount. So, 
under the circumstances, this is all Id reasonably expect it to do to reflect the delay. 
 Im aware O hasnt got an alternative bank account set up and it isnt planning to 
open one. However, as HSBC is required to pay the money to the correct legal 
entity, Im satisfied it hasnt done anything wrong by declining to transfer the funds to 
a directors personal account. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 June 2023.
