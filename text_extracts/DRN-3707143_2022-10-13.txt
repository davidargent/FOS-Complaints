The complaint
Mr G complains that NewDay Limited, trading as Aqua, wont refund to him the money that 
he paid for three purchases and about the customer service that he received. 
What happened
Between July 2021 and February 2022 Mr G had disputed payments for nine purchases for 
which hed used his NewDay credit card. NewDay had refunded the payments that hed 
made for six of those transactions but it hadnt refunded the payments that hed made for the 
other three transactions. Hed paid £563.99 for some flights in October 2021, £99 for a Covid 
test in November 2021 and £486.98 for a washing machine also in November 2021. Mr G 
complained to NewDay in February 2022 because hed not received a call back from its 
disputes team after being advised that it would call him. NewDay upheld his complaint and 
offered him £40 compensation  which it later increased to £80 and which was credited to 
his account. Mr G then complained to this service and said that NewDay should refund all of 
the disputed transactions. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He thought that the 
compensation that NewDay had paid for the missed call back was sufficient. He didnt think 
that NewDay had done anything wrong by not refunding the three transactions. He said that 
NewDay hadnt considered the transactions under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 but he was satisfied that claims under section75 wouldnt have had a chance of 
success based on the evidence that NewDay had already received.
Mr G has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
washing machine wasnt delivered to his address but an address in the area and the 
confirmation was sent after his phone was hacked, the flight tickets were cancelled by e-mail 
and that the Covid test was taken by someone else and that the merchant had got his details 
mixed up with another persons. He says that he did a home Covid test which was positive 
and that was why he couldnt take the flights. 
Our investigator asked him to provide evidence to demonstrate the above but he says that 
hes not able to retrieve the information requested as he has a new e-mail account. He says 
if an award is not made in his favour he will take this case to the small claims court.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr G complained to New Day in February 2022 because hed not received a call 
back from its disputes team after being advised that it would call him - NewDay 
upheld his complaint, apologised and credited £80 compensation to his account;
I can understand the frustration that Mr G will have felt when he didnt receive the call 
back but I consider that NewDays apology and the £80 that its credited to his 
account is a fair and reasonable response to his complaint and Im not persuaded 
that a higher amount of compensation is justified in these circumstances;
Mr G complained to this service and said that NewDay should refund all of the 
disputed transactions so Ive considered whether it should have made a chargeback 
claim for those transactions and whether it should have refunded him for those 
transactions under section 75;
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
NewDay says that it contacted the merchant about the flight tickets and the merchant 
provided proof that the tickets were delivered to Mr G by e-mail, it said that the flight 
booking hadnt been cancelled by Mr G and that the flight went ahead as planned  
so Mr G wasnt entitled to a refund of the £563.99 that hed paid for the flights;
Mr G says that he cancelled the flights by e-mail because he had a positive Covid 
test  but hes not been able to provide any evidence to show that he sent an e-mail 
to the merchant to cancel the flights, that he had tested positive for Covid or that he 
was entitled to a refund  so Im not persuaded that NewDay acted incorrectly by not 
refunding the payment to his account;
NewDay says that it contacted the merchant about the washing machine and the 
merchant said that it was delivered to Mr G and that Mr G confirmed that hed 
received it both by message and in writing;
Mr G says that the washing machine wasnt delivered to his address but to an 
address in the area and the confirmation was sent after his phone was hacked  but 
he's not been able to provide any evidence to show that the washing machine was 
delivered to another address or that the confirmation message was sent after his 
phone had been hacked - so Im not persuaded that NewDay acted incorrectly by not 
refunding the payment to his account;
NewDay says that it contacted the merchant about the Covid test and it provided 
evidence to show that the appointment wasnt cancelled, the test took place and the 
result was negative; 
Mr G says that the Covid test was taken by someone else, the merchant had got his 
details mixed up with another persons and he did a home Covid test which was 
positive  but hes not been able to provide any evidence to show that he cancelled 
the test and was entitled to a refund - so Im not persuaded that NewDay acted 
incorrectly by not refunding the payment to his account;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
NewDay didnt consider whether Mr G was entitled to a refund for the above 
transactions under section 75  but I consider that the evidence that it obtained from 
the merchants was enough to show that there hadnt been a breach of contract or a 
misrepresentation for each of those transactions  so if it had considered his claims under 75 I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to conclude that 
the claims shouldnt be upheld;
other than not calling Mr G back, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show New Day has acted incorrectly in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require New Day to refund to 
Mr G any of the amounts that hes claimed, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2022.
