The complaint
Mr Z complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has dealt with a fraudulent 
transaction.
What happened
Mr Z advertised a computer for sale and was asked if the computer could be sold using 
PayPal. He says he agreed and received the payment of £680 and sent the computer to the 
buyer. Mr Z says he was then told the transaction had been challenged and PayPal said the 
purchase was unauthorised and took the money from Mr Z's account. He says PayPal is  
now using a debt collection company to recover the money from him and says PayPal 
should not have allowed a fraudster to use one of its accounts.
PayPal says the transaction was reported as unauthorised and so it refunded the money. It 
says the account used to pay Mr Z was from Holland and the name didn't match the person 
the computer was sent to. It also says the transaction was not covered by its seller 
protection and the account terms and conditions say only a transaction that says it is 
covered by such protection is eligible. PayPal as a gesture of goodwill has offered Mr Z a 
credit of £333.
Mr Z brought his complaint and our investigator didn't uphold the complaint. The investigator 
thought Mr Z wasn't covered by the seller protection and PayPal had complied with its terms 
and conditions. The investigator thought the person buying the computer and the account 
name didn't match and PayPal again in line with account terms and conditions was entitled 
to pass a debt to a third party company for collection. The investigator thought PayPal's offer 
fair and reasonable.
Mr Z doesn't accept that view and says names and account names often don't match when 
making these sorts of transactions. He says he is a victim of fraud and PayPal is 
responsible. He also says he wasn't told he wasn't eligible for seller protection and an 
absence of such notice is misleading and that PayPal should refund his money.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for similar reasons. I realise Mr Z will be disappointed by 
my decision and I fully appreciate he is the victim of fraud. But that doesn't mean I think 
PayPal has acted unfairly or made a mistake for the reasons I will explain.
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I think Mr Z would have agreed to 
when the account was opened. Those terms and conditions say that a transaction is marked 
DRN-1345544as eligible if seller protection is available. This transaction was not marked as eligible, and so 
I don't think Mr Z was covered by seller protection. I'm satisfied those account terms and 
conditions make that clear and that Paypal has acted in line with them and has not made a 
mistake or acted unfairly. It follows that  I don't think PayPal made a mistake by deducting 
the money and asking Mr Z to repay it.
I appreciate what Mr Z says, that an absence of notification is misleading and unfair. I 
understand why Mr Z would think that. But I'm satisfied he agreed to the account terms and 
conditions, and I can't see in those circumstances that PayPal has made a mistake or is 
obliged to point out that a transaction is not eligible for protection. We are not PayPal's 
regulator and it is not our role to tell it how it runs its business or decide if its contract terms 
are misleading.
I can see that the buyer name and account details don't match and the account details 
were for a person in Holland. I appreciate Mr Z says that is not unusual but I would have 
expected him in those circumstances to have considered carrying out further checks with the 
buyer and or PayPal. I also appreciate that Paypal didn't suggest Mr Z report the matter to 
the police which I accept would have been appropriate.
I don't think it follows that PayPal can monitor every account and determine if an account or 
transaction is fraudulent. I can't hold PayPal responsible as Mr Z would like for a 
compromised PayPal account. Overall I accept that fraud is a major problem for companies 
and individuals and I find that PayPal is not responsible for what has taken place or could 
have done anything further to avoid it taking place. For those reasons I can't order PayPal to 
refund Mr Z's money. I also make it clear that I think in line with agreed account terms and 
conditions, PayPal is entitled to use a third party company to recover a debt.
It is up to Mr Z if he wishes to accept PayPal's gesture of goodwill offer.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2020.
