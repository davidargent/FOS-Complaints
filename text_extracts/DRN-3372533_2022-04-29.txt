In response to Ms Gs complaint STF issued its final response letter (FRL) on 18 August 
2021. It said that it only considered loans within the last six-year period as this was the 
period of time that it holds information about Ms Gs lending. 
In the FRL it explained that Ms G had taken 17 loans between 2015  2019. STF didnt 
uphold Ms Gs complaint because it considered proportionate checks were undertaken. 
Unhappy with this response, Ms Gs representatives referred her complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service.   
An adjudicator, then reviewed Ms Gs complaint and she concluded STF hadnt acted 
unfairly when it approved loans 1  4. Although, she did say, that she thought further checks 
needed to have carried out before loan 4 was advanced. 
But, the adjudicator thought, that from and including loan 5 all future loans shouldnt have 
been granted. She said the loans were now harmful for Ms G and the repayments were no 
longer sustainable. 
Ms Gs representative acknowledged receipt of the adjudicators assessment. 
STF partially agreed with the adjudicator. It said that it would pay redress of £1,689.99 to 
Ms G which is compensation for loans 6  14. 
However, STF didnt accept the findings made in relation to loan 5 or loans 15  17. In 
summary it said:
Loans 1  4 werent upheld, and STF cant see any change in circumstances which 
would lead it to conclude there was a problem with loan 5. 
Before 2019 a credit check was only carried out on before the first loan was granted. 
In 2019 the industry regulator carried out a review and implemented 
recommendations that stemmed from it. It says following this the regulator found all 
loans analysed to be 100% compliant.
From late 2019, STF is able to evidence that it factored into Ms Gs expenditure the 
findings of its credit checks which included any adverse information that it may have 
been aware of. 
The offer in relation to loans 6 - 14 was put to Ms G who didnt accept it, she confirmed that 
she was happy to accept the adjudicators assessment of the complaint. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Ms G has accepted the adjudicators findings about loans 1  4 and STF has accepted that 
redress should be paid for loans 6  14. So, I now consider that there is no longer any 
disagreement about these loans and I will not make a decision about those loans in this 
decision but I have included loans 6  14 in the putting things right section at the end of this 
decision. 
But I have kept in mind these loans when thinking about the overall lending relationship 
between Ms G and STF. 
Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loan 5 and loans 15 - 17 were 
advanced. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms G could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might bereasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms G. These factors include: 
Ms G having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms G having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms G coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms G. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time these loans were advanced, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Gs complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 5 and 15 - 17 were 
proportionate and Ill explain why below. 
Loan 5
I agree with the adjudicator, that by loan 5 I think Ms G was showing signs of financial 
distress and therefore the loans were unlikely to be sustainable for her. 
I accept, based on the application form that STF has provided me for this loan that it may 
well have considered Ms G had sufficient disposable income to be able to afford the weekly 
repayment of £35. She had a declared weekly income of £399 and declared outgoings of 
£215. Leaving a weekly disposable income of £184. 
I also know, because STF has told us, that no other checks were carried out at the time, for 
example a credit check. 
I also agree with the adjudicator, that by loan 4, and so this applied to loan 5, that further in-
depth checks ought to have been carried out. Given, the information Ms G had provided to 
STF, and thinking about other factors such as the time in debt and her borrowing history, I 
no longer think it was reasonable to have relied on what she had declared. These further checks needed to verify Ms Gs income and outgoings and couldve been 
done a number of different ways, it couldve asked to see copies of her wage slips or her 
bank statements. 
Im not able to say, exactly what STF may have seen had it carried out a proportionate 
check. But, to reach a fair outcome, I dont think I need to consider what a proportionate 
check may have shown because Im satisfied that STF had sufficient information to be able 
to make an informed decision not to lend to Ms G. I say this for the following reasons:
Ms G had been indebted to SFT for around 17 months without a break in lending. 
She was returning for new loans either on the same day or very shortly after her 
previous loans had been repaid. 
On three of her previous loans it had taken her longer than the contractual term to 
repay the loan  a sign that she may have been struggling to repay her loans. 
Ms Gs borrowing wasnt decreasing, it remained flat as she borrowed the same 
amount for each loan but there were no signs that her indebtedness or need for 
credit was decreasing. 
Taking these factors into account, and the fact Ms G had returned for further borrowing to 
extend her borrowing by another 16 weeks, I think STF ought to have realised the lending 
was now harmful for Ms G. 
Ive carefully considered what STF says about Ms Gs circumstances being no different at 
this loan compared to the first four. But I disagree, I now think it had further information as to 
how Ms G was using her loans in terms of repayments and when new loans were being 
advanced. So, it had new information and emerging information that STF didnt have for 
Ms G when she started borrowing. 
This has led me to conclude that this loan should be upheld, for the same reasons as 
explained by the adjudicator and for the reasons Ive given above. 
Loans 15  17
For these loans, I would say, that based on the details in the application forms, that STF 
couldve reasonably concluded that Ms G would be in a position to afford the repayments 
she was committed to making. 
Like loan 5, I still think the checks needed to go further for the same reasons as I explained 
above. However, it does look like at various points STF did undertake further checks which 
included checking the benefit payments and Ms G received as well as looking at bank 
statements. But, for the reasons that Ive outline below, it ought to be have been apparent to 
STF that further lending wasnt sustainable.  
For these later loans STF has shown that its affordability checks had changed. The format 
has changed, and it does look like STF by now, had started to use the credit checks to look 
at Ms Gs expenditure to sees if there were other credit commitments. For example, loan 15 
her credit expenditure (excluding other STF loans) was £194.36 per month. 
So, it does look like, at least by the time of these loans that STFs checks went further then 
they may have previous gone. But, again, that doesnt mean the loans were sustainable for 
Ms G. 
STF has provided a credit report summary for Ms G  but its undated so I dont know what 
period of time that it relates to or to which loan(s). But, I would say, assuming this report is for Ms G, that it does look like at some point Ms G had some problems repaying credit as the 
report shows an account in default and a County Court Judgement. But it looks like, as far as 
I can see that no further investigations were carried out to find out any further information 
about this. 
It also says that a credit report wouldve been carried out. But STF has only been able to 
provide me with an example of the sort of information that it may have gathered, but it has 
not been able to provide the actual credit report data it received. 
That isnt the end of the matter, on top of carrying out a proportionate check, STF also need 
to be mindful whether the loans were sustainable for Ms G, not just pounds and pence 
affordable. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms G, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms G. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Ms G, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, this point had already been reached in this 
case, but by loan 15:
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms G was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms G had taken 14 previous loans over the last four years. In my view, 
Ms Gs loan history up until this point clearly indicated that her underlying financial 
situation didnt seem to be improving, given her loans werent significantly 
decreasing. 
Ms G continued to have problems repaying loans within the agreed repayment 
schedule.  For example, it took 9 weeks longer than planned to repay loan 13. These 
earlier loans were for similar sums, so its likely, that unless Ms Gs situation had 
changed, that shed also struggle to sustainable repay these loans. 
Ms G developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous ones 
were repaid, for example, loans 11 and 14 and at times Ms G had more than one 
loan running at the same time. So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not Ms G, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a 
long-term financial need. To me, this is also indicative of her indebtedness not being 
sustainable.
Ms G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 17 was 
taken out more than four and half years after loan one was advanced. But loan 16 
was taken on the same day, so at the time Ms G actually owed STF £500 in capital 
on two loans with two different repayment terms. Ms G had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Ms G lost out when STF provided loan 5 and loans 15 - 17 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Gs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Gs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 5  17 and Ill go on to set out what STF 
should do to put things right.
Ive also considered what STF has said about the review, but it hasnt provided any details of 
the exact date in 2019 this review occurred, or at what point the recommendations were put in place. Indeed, it also isnt clear to me how many loans were checked or whether any of 
Ms Gs loans were actually checked. 
So, I cant place any significant weight on this review, given Im not entirely sure how it 
interacts with Ms Gs loans. But what I would say, and what Ive pointed out above, is that for 
loans 15  17 the types of checks that were carried out did change. 
My remit is to consider the complaint, based on the individual circumstances and come to 
what I consider to be a fair and reasonable outcome. Given what Ive seen, the overall 
pattern of lending was in my view significant enough to have led STF to not have granted 
these loans.
As Ive said above, STF had already agreed to pay compensation for loans 6  14 and Ive 
included what it has agreed to do in the putting things section below. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms G from loan 5 as I think it ought to. 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms G may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms G in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms G would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms G loans 5 to 17 so in addition to what it has already agreed to 
pay it should:
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms G towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms G 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms G originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should pay Ms G A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Ms Gs borrowing about loans 5 - 17 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from 
Ms Gs credit file. *HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms G 
a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Gs complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 May 2022.
