Mr A says that he was caught in a cycle  of debt for around five years. He says he had to 
borrow to make the repayments due on his existing debts and he was struggling to meet his 
priority bills. He says the situation has caused him stress and that the impact on his credit 
file meant  he couldnt access  lower  cost finance.
Mr A thinks  that more checks should have been  carried out before the loans were  provided. 
QuickQuid didnt accept  that it had lent irresponsibly. It said that before providing the loans it 
carried out proportionate affordability  checks including validating Mr As income and 
expenses. It says there were significant  breaks in Mr As borrowing showing he wasnt  
dependent on the loans  and that the loans were repaid  in line with the agreements  (aside  
from two late payments which were quickly resolved) 
Ref: DRN89961592Our adjudicator said that he hadnt seen  enough  to say it was unfair  that loans one to three 
and the initial drawdown on loan four were  provided. He said that due to insufficient 
evidence he was unable  to say whether the top up for loan four and loan five were  
unaffordable. He said that if further  information was provided by the required date these  
could be considered further. He thought  that loans six to 25 shouldnt  have been lent.
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr A refunded all interest  and charges that he paid on 
loans six to 25 (along  with interest)  and that all entries about these loans should  be removed 
from his credit file.
QuickQuid didn't accept  our adjudicator's view saying the loans fluctuated  in amount and 
that Mr A didnt show signs of financial difficulty.  
As the complaint hasn't been  resolved informally, it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to decide. This is the last stage of our process. If Mr A accepts my decision it is legally 
binding on both parties.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  what's  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr A could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN89961593Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't  automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook ("CONC"), defines  sustainable  
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower won't be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if they're unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  
borrowing further.
I've carefully considered all of the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr A's complaint.
Mr As first four loans were all for £100. The repayment amounts were not big compared  to 
his income and each  loan was repaid before  the next was agreed. Because of this I agree 
with our adjudicator  that based  on the evidence provided I dont find I can say these loans 
were unfairly provided.
The fourth loan was topped up with a further £100.  This loan was then followed by loan five 
for £150. Given the timing of these loans,  I think a pattern of borrowing was emerging, 
however at this stage  I still dont find I have enough evidence to safely  conclude these loans 
shouldnt have been provided.
Although QuickQuid has noted  breaks in the lending chain having  looked through the dates 
of repayment  and when new loans were  taken out I havent found any significant breaks. 
Therefore I find that all the loans provided  form part of the same lending  chain.
By loan six, Mr As overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently reliant 
on short-term loans.  This was Mr As sixth loan in nine months  and the amounts he was 
borrowing did not decrease over this period.  Mr As borrowing increased to around £300 and 
stayed around this amount (when  top up loans were  included) for the rest of the borrowing 
relationship with QuickQuid. In my view, the pattern of lending itself shows  that the loans 
from loan six were  unsustainable  so I dont  think QuickQuid  should have provided these.
Overall, I think that Mr A lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 
loan six onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr A's indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short term use over an extended period of 
time. The sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr A's 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Because of the above I'm upholding this complaint about loans six to 25.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  six to 25 (including  all 
associated top ups). CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr A paid on loans 6 to 25 (including top ups);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Ref: DRN89961594The number of loans  taken from loan six means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans six to 25 should be removed from Mr A's credit  file.
*HMRC requires  you to take off tax from this interest. If Mr A asks you for a certificate 
showing how much  tax you've taken  off, you should  provide  this. If you intend  to use the 
refund to reduce an amount Mr A owes, you must do this after tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2019.
