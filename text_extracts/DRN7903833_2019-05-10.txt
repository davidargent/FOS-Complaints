K820x#14complaint
Mr M1 and Mr M2 complain that theyve overpaid interest of £6,172.32 on a loan from HSBC  
UK Bank plc. 
background
Mr M1 and Mr M2 entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with HSBC  in January 2010 to 
consolidate their overdraft and small business loans into a manged loan. The loan was for 
£16,190 repayable over twelve years.  Mr M1 and Mr M2 repaid the loan early by making  a 
payment of £14,456.50 in January 2013.  They complained to HSBC  in June 2018 that theyd 
been overcharged interest of £6,172.32.  They  werent satisfied  with its response so 
complained to this service.
The investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He reviewed  the 
annual loan statements and hadnt  found that HSBC had taken a different approach than 
was set out in the loan agreement - and he concluded that he couldnt say that HSBC  had 
acted unfairly.
Mr M1 and Mr M2 have asked for their complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman.  They  
say, in summary, that: 
the loan agreement states that the early settlement figure  after a quarter of the term, 
on the basis that every payment is made, is £14,112.21  but they made all 
payments on time and paid £14,456.50 to settle the loan; and
the loan account statement shows a term of 145 months but the loan was only for 
144 months.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The loan agreement  (and the pre-contract information)  which were sent to Mr M1 and Mr M2 
and were accepted  by them clearly  show that the loan was for £16,190  repayable over 144 
months by 143 payments of £219.62 and one payment of £220.19. The loan agreement also 
shows that the interest rate was 12.70% (equivalent to an APR of 13.5%), the total charge 
for interest  was £15,435.85 and that interest was calculated on the daily cleared balance of 
the loan. 
Mr M1 and Mr M2 accepted the loan from HSBC  and in doing  so agreed to the terms on 
which the loan was offered. But they repaid the loan early by making a payment of 
£14,456.50 in January 2013. They  then complained  to HSBC in June 2018  and said that 
theyd been overcharged £6,172.32 of interest. It responded to them a few days later and 
sent them its final response letter in August 2018   just over eight weeks after theyd 
complained to it  but they received its final response letter  after theyd complained  to this 
service. 
Mr M1 and Mr M2 have referred to a loan account statement which shows  that the duration 
of the loan was 145 months. But the agreement shows that the loan was for 144 months, the 
repayments set out in the agreement are for 144 months and the total amount of the loan 
and the interest  total the same as the amount  that wouldve been repaid by the 144 
repayments. 
Ref: DRN79038332The loan agreement   which was prepared by HSBC in December 2009 - says that the loan 
can be settled if a quarter  of the term has elapsed  by a payment of £14,112.21. But it also 
says that the amount is an estimate and is calculated on the basis that all payments are 
made on time. And the loan wasnt made  to Mr M1 and Mr M2 until about  two weeks after 
the agreement  had been prepared.
HSBC has provided  the account statement which shows all repayments  to the account from 
January 2010  to January  2013. It shows that all of the payments due under  the agreement  
had been made by Mr M1 and Mr M2 and that the balance  of the loan in January 2013 was 
£14,456.50. And that is the amount  that Mr M1 and Mr M2 paid to settle their loan. It says 
that interest  has been charged on the daily cleared  balance of the loan in accordance with 
the loan agreement and that the interest has been calculated correctly.
Im not persuaded that Mr M1 and Mr M2 have  provided enough evidence to show  that 
HSBC has calculated the interest  incorrectly  or that it has acted unfairly  or unreasonably  in 
connection with their loan. So I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require HSBC to refund to Mr M1 and Mr M2 any of the interest that 
theyve paid under the agreement or to pay them any compensation  or to take any other 
action in response to their complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr M1 and Mr M2s complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M1 and Mr M2 
to accept or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
