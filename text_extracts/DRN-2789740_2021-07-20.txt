DRN-2789740
The complaint
Mr F complains that Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis) havent refunded interest on a 
transaction despite the merchant refunding it.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know it will disappoint Mr F, but I agree with the investigators opinion. Please let me 
explain why.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory, as some of it is here I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
Mr F received a refund for his flight from the merchant, but it was his choice not to pay off 
the balance of his credit card and, until that was done, Vanquis were fairly able to charge 
interest on the outstanding balance as thats what the terms and conditions of Mr Fs credit 
card allowed them to do.
So, Im not asking Vanquis to take any further action.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2021.
