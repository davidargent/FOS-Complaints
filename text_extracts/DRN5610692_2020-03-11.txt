K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd recorded a default  on his credit  file with an incorrect date.  
He says NewDay should compensate him for loss of reputation and restricting his ability  to 
obtain credit.
background
Mr S held a credit card account which was originally held with a different provider Ill call C. 
The account  fell into arrears and C sent Mr S default  notices in November 2008 and 
January 2009.  
The account  was then transferred to NewDay in August  2011.  In March 2013  NewDay 
issued Mr S another default notice. In August 2013, the account was defaulted with an 
outstanding balance of £3,597.10 and sold to a debt purchaser Ill refer to as IL. 
Around July 2018, Mr S says he checked his credit file and noticed that the recorded default 
date of the account was showing as August 2013.  He didnt think  this was correct so he 
asked IL to amend it. He said the account  had been  defaulted in January 2009 and that 
accounts can only be defaulted once. He said the default should  have been removed from 
his credit file in 2015, as defaults  should  appear on an individuals  credit  file for six years. 
IL investigated  Mr Ss complaint and didnt uphold  it. It also got in touch with NewDay and 
asked it to respond to Mr Ss concerns about when the account was defaulted. Mr S didnt 
agree with ILs response so referred a complaint to this service.  
NewDay responded to Mr S in November 2018 and explained it sold the account to IL in 
August 2013 and the account was defaulted  at the same time. NewDay confirmed that it 
hadnt provided a default  notice in August 2013,  but concluded that the default was fairly  
applied. It said it couldnt now remove the default and Mr S would need to contact IL. It also 
offered him £25 compensation for its handling of the complaint.  
Mr S was also unhappy with NewDays response  and referred  his complaint to our service.
The adjudicator who investigated Mr Ss complaint concluded the account had been fairly 
defaulted in August 2013 and it hadnt  been defaulted previously. The adjudicator explained 
when Mr Ss account was defaulted it was good practice for a lender to send a default notice 
but they weren't required to do so. So he said the default recorded  on Mr Ss credit file was a 
fair reflection of what  happened and he didnt  recommend NewDay do anything else.
NewDay accepted  his assessment. But Mr S didnt, in summary he said:
C issued several default notices, but hadnt been contacted for information and there 
was no evidence to show the account wasnt defaulted before  August 2013;
Mr S wasnt provided a new card or able to use one but was issued a new credit 
agreement by NewDay and the account statements showed  a minimum payment of 
£326 which was significantly over any normal contractual payment required;
 
Ref: DRN56106922NewDay hadnt attempted to contact him or spoke to him by phone when it said it 
had;
the adjudicator  had assumed Mr S could not afford to increase his payment offer, but 
had no evidence to support this;
NewDay didnt follow best practice  when it didnt  issue a default notice in           
August 2013;
ILs notes said NewDay  sent a corrective notice in September 2016 but it hadnt 
provided a copy;
the Information Commissioners Offices  rules  on timescales  for correction  hadnt  
been followed;
the adjudicator  hadnt covered any of the customer service issues  Mr S had 
experienced.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I think NewDay  has 
treated Mr S fairly so Im not asking it to do anything to put things right. Ive explained my 
reasoning in more  detail  below. 
was Mr Ss account defaulted before  it was acquired by NewDay? 
This service has since been in contact with C and it hasnt been able to provide any 
information about Mr Ss account. This isnt surprising given the account was sold in 2011. 
Given how long its been since  NewDay  acquired  Mr Ss account  I dont  think its 
unreasonable that it doesnt have documentation  to show  what  happened before then. 
 
The default  notice  C issued in November 2008 showed an arrears balance  of £3,704.48 
while the January  2009 default notice showed an arrears balance of £2,282.00. Both 
required Mr S to either pay off the outstanding arrears or agree a suitable payment 
arrangement or the account would  be defaulted. 
The terms and conditions  of Mr Ss account  with C explain:
We might  put you on a PayDown Plan
If you continue for a further period  to make payments that are not sufficient to help you pay 
your balance down  as explained above, as responsible lenders we may move all or part of 
your balance to a PayDown Plan.  We may do this as an alternative to restricting or 
suspending the use of your card, or we may also stop the use of your card or reduce your 
credit limit.
When we set up a PayDown  Plan,  we will take your existing outstanding balance,  estimate  
how much  interest you will incur  if you repay  it over a reasonable period (for example, four 
years), and then increase  your contractual minimum payment with the aim of repaying that 
balance in this reasonable period. In other  words,  we will change the way that we calculate  
the contractual minimum payment  so that you have  to pay more each month to ensure that 
Ref: DRN56106923you pay down your balance more quickly and reduce the amount you are paying for credit.  If 
we allow  you to continue  to use your account  after we have  set up a PayDown Plan,  we will 
also increase the contractual minimum payment you need  to make in respect  of any new 
balances (see How is your contractual minimum payment calculated?).
We will always tell you if we are going to put you on a PayDown Plan so that you know in 
advance that your monthly contractual minimum payments are going to increase. If you 
cannot pay the increased amount you should  contact us to discuss  alternatives.
 
I think whats most likely  to have happened is that C agreed a PayDown Plan with Mr S and 
this was in place until the account was sold to NewDay. This matches us with what  hes told 
us  that he agreed a payment plan and is supported by NewDays customer contact notes 
which show it received  a letter from Mr S in March 2013 and that he was on Cs LOB plan. 
Mr Ss account being subject to a PayDown Plan also most likely  explains why the monthly  
payment required  was above what would  have been  his normal contractual  minimum 
payment based  on his balance, and why interest  most likely wasnt  being  applied to the 
outstanding balance.  
While I can see default notices were  sent to Mr S before NewDay  took ownership of his 
account, I havent seen anything to confirm the account was defaulted before then. Mr S has 
provided a statement from C in July 2008  which shows  his account balance  was over 
£20,000. When the account  was acquired by NewDay the outstanding balance was around  
£9,000. So, Mr S had clearly made  considerable payments towards the account  over that 
period. I think a plan was agreed which most likely  meant C never defaulted  the account. So, 
on balance, I dont  think the account  was defaulted  in January 2009 or any time before it was 
acquired by NewDay.
was it fair for NewDay to default the account when it did?
Mr S says NewDay  should have defaulted  the account sooner. For me to conclude  NewDay  
is required to compensate Mr S I would  need to be satisfied that the default should  have 
been recorded earlier and that Mr S was caused a detriment as a result. 
The statements  show  that after NewDay acquired his account Mr S continued  to make 
regular monthly payments  of £326  until December  2012 when no payment was applied to 
the account. In January 2013  a £50 payment was received  but this was less than the £326 
required as part of Mr Ss agreement. NewDay sent Mr S an arrears  notice on 28 January 
2013, explaining the arrears on the account  and asking him to pay off the arrears or get in 
touch. 
Mr S paid £50 towards the account  again  in February and I can see NewDay  tried to call him 
and also sent a letter. 
NewDays account notes  show it received  a letter from Mr S in March  2013 which explained  
he was in financial difficulties and could only pay £50 a month towards the account.  Mr S 
made two payments of £50 towards the account that month. 
NewDays notes show it didnt deem Mr Ss payment  proposal  sufficient, it left Mr S 
voicemails at least twice in March  2013 and also sent him an income and expenditure form 
to complete. But I cant see Mr S provided the information NewDay had requested. 
Ref: DRN56106924I can see after the default notice was issued  in March 2013  Mr S made  payments of £50 
towards the account balance each month between April and August 2013. These payments 
were less than the minimum  payment required and I can see the May and June payments 
were received after the due date. I can also see that NewDay  made several attempts to 
contact him during this time. 
On 29 July 2013 NewDay issued Mr S a letter explaining he hadnt made the minimum 
payments in June  or July 2013. As the minimum payment also wasnt received in August 
2013, I think it was reasonable for NewDay to default the account at that point.  
Ive also thought about whether NewDay should  have  defaulted  the account sooner. The 
ICOs guidance from the time; Data Protection  Technical  Guidance  Filing defaults with 
credit reference agencies says:  
The following  are in line with the practices currently adopted by most lenders:
Accounts should not be routinely filed as being in default where full payments or 
those due under a rescheduled  agreement are fewer than three consecutive 
months in arrears.  
Accounts should normally be filed as being in default where those payments due 
have not been  received for six months.
Mr S hadnt  made the full payments required for eight months which  is slightly longer than 
whats set out in the ICOs guidance.  But at the time the default was issued he was regularly 
paying £50 a month towards the outstanding  balance. And, NewDays contact notes show  
the minimum payment  it required to agree  a new plan was £62.78. 
Mr Ss payments were  less than £13 short of what NewDay  would accept and before 
December 2012  hed kept to the payment arrangement. I think it was reasonable for 
NewDay to try and find out a little more about Mr Ss financial difficulties and give him more 
of an opportunity to agree  a repayment  arrangement before defaulting the account. So I 
dont think it made a mistake defaulting  the account  in August 2013 rather than anytime  
earlier. 
should NewDay have  issued Mr S another default notice?
As NewDay had issued Mr S with a default  notice  in March 2013 I dont think  it needed  to 
send him any additional  notification in August 2013.  The default notice in March 2013 clearly  
set out the consequences  if Mr S didnt pay off the arrears or agree a repayment  
arrangement by a certain date. And the default  notice explained that these actions may take 
place on or after this date. I think NewDay had done  enough  to make Mr S aware the 
account was in arrears  and that his repayment  proposal wasnt  sufficient. As Mr S hadnt 
responded to NewDays  requests for information,  paid the amount required under the default 
notice, or agreed  an acceptable payment plan, I dont find it was unreasonable to default the 
account. 
I think NewDay should have been  able to provide  a copy  of the corrective notice it sent. And 
its notes dont show that it was sent. But Mr S has confirmed he received. I can see he 
contacted NewDay  in October 2016,  and Ive not seen anything  to suggest Mr S raised 
concerns at that time that the account had previously been defaulted. 
Ref: DRN56106925Even if the corrective notice hadnt been  sent I dont think  it would have a significant impact 
on what a fair resolution to Mr Ss complaint is. As I think  the default  was applied  correctly 
and fairly,  I dont think NewDay needed to take any action to amend what  it recorded on 
Mr Ss credit  file.  
NewDays handling of Mr Ss complaint
 
NewDays account notes  show the first time it received Mr Ss complaint was in 
September 2018. It issued its final response  within a few weeks  and offered Mr S £25 
compensation. I havent seen it made  any significant  errors in its handling of Mr Ss 
complaint. And the compensation its offered is fair. So Im not asking it to do anything else.  
If Mr S would like to accept the £25 offered  he should contact  NewDay  directly. 
my final decision
I think NewDay Ltd has treated Mr S fairly,  so I dont uphold his complaint. Under the rules of 
the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject  my decision 
before 11 April 2020
