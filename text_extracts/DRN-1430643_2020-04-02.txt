The complaint
Ms H says AXA France IARD mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Ms H bought the policy in 1998 at the same time as taking out a store card. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Ms H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Ms Hs case.
Ive decided not to uphold Ms Hs complaint for the following reasons. 
Ms Hs store card application had been ticked to indicate she wanted PPI. Ms H says she 
didnt add this tick. But, given how long ago it was I dont think I can reasonably uphold the 
complaint based solely on her recollection of something that happened so long ago. It could 
be that she ticked the box at the time but later forgot about it. So, I think AXA France IARD 
made Ms H aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and that she most likely 
chose to take it. 
AXA France IARD didnt recommend the PPI to Ms H so it didnt have to check if it was right 
for her. 
Its possible the information AXA France IARD gave Ms H about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Ms H doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didnt cover  and based on what I know about her circumstances it looks like the 
policy couldve been useful to her. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped her 
buying it. 
Ive taken into account Ms Hs comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Ms Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
