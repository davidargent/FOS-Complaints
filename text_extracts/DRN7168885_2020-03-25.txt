to him.

Our adjudicator didnt  think that Sunny should  have  agreed to lend Mr S loans 4 to 17. 
Sunny disagreed with that view.  Another  of our adjudicators looked at the complaint. He 
didnt think it was wrong for Sunny to agree to lend loans 4 and 5 to Mr S. But he thought 
that Sunny shouldnt  have lent loans 6 to 17.  
Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators view. However, it later said that it thought  it shouldnt  
have agreed to lend loans  13 to 17 to Mr S. It offered to settle the complaint on that basis. 
Mr S did not accept Sunnys offer as it was not in line with our adjudicators  recommendation. 
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN71688852Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Neither party has disagreed with what our adjudicator said in respect of loans 1 to 6. Just to 
be clear,  for loans 1 to 4, I think Sunny was entitled to rely on the information Mr S provided 
when it decided whether to agree  his loans. And from the information provided, I havent 
seen anything to suggest the repayments wouldnt have been sustainably  affordable.  
As to loans 4 and 5, I agree with our second adjudicator. I can see how Sunny should  have  
probably asked  more questions in respect of this borrowing  perhaps to include a full review of 
Mr Ss financial circumstances. But the evidence before me doesnt suggest that Sunny would 
have done anything wrong  in agreeing  loans  4 and 5 even if that review  had been undertaken. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  to Mr S was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If that was the case, Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out 6 loans within 9 months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not that Mr S was having to borrow  further to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that his indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £100  and loan 6 was for £300. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr S was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in their income 
but to meet an ongoing need.  
Ref: DRN71688853Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 17 was taken 
out almost two years after the first. And it was for the same amount. Mr S had paid large 
amounts of interest  to effectively service  a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  which Mr S borrowed was likely to have  had negative  implications 
on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 17 and Sunny will need to put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 to 17. 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 17 should  be removed from Mr Ss credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding this complaint. Elevate  Credit International 
must put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
