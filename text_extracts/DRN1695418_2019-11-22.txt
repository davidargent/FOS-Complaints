Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  shouldnt  have provided 
him with instalment loans because he couldnt  afford  to repay  them. 
background 
Mr S took nine instalment loans from Sunny between March 2015  and March  2018. A 
summary of Mr Ss borrowing,  based  on the information provided to us by Sunny, can be

Our adjudicator thought Sunny had treated Mr S fairly when it provided  loans  1  6 and loan 
9, so he made no award against Sunny for these loans. 
However, the adjudicator didnt think the seventh  and eighth  loans shouldve been provided. 
The adjudicator felt that by that by this point a pattern  of lending had been established which 
shouldve indicated to Sunny that Mr S wasnt able to sustainably make his loan repayments.  
Sunny didnt accept  the adjudicators findings.  It made a number  of points including:
there were significant gaps between some of the loans, including loans 8 and 9,
it carried out thorough  eligibility,  creditworthiness and affordability checks  before 
each loan was approved; and
the combined contractual repayments  made  up a small portion of Mr Ss declared  
income.
As no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN16954182These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  without  having  to borrow  further  to do 
so. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that 
a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments  sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able 
to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. And Ive decided to partly  uphold 
Mr Ss complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators  findings  about loans 1  6 or loan 9. Because  of 
this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement  about these loans. So I wont be making 
a decision about  this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship  Mr S had with 
Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he 
took.
I also havent recreated individual, proportionate  affordability checks for loans  7 and 8 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Instead Ive looked  at the overall pattern of 
Sunnys lending history  with Mr S, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which Sunny 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had been  regularly taking  loans for almost  two years,  and although 
Ref: DRN16954183there are some small gaps between loans, in most cases  these  werent significant. 
However, Mr S had spent  the majority of the last two years indebted to Sunny.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely  than not he was having  to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan repayments was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £150,  but he quickly took his indebtedness  up to £250  by 
loan 3. This did fluctuate at some points but didnt  decrease  by a significant  amount, 
or for a sustained  period,  going  forward. I think at loan 7 Sunny ought to have known 
that Mr S was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his income but to 
meet an ongoing  need.
Mr S had been provided with a new loan before he had settled his previous ones. 
This took place  both before and after loan 7.  
Mr S wasnt reducing the amounts he owed to Sunny. For example, loan 8 was taken 
out around two year after Mr Ss first instalment loan was approved, and this loan 
was for a larger amount than his first. 
I think that Mr S lost out when Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; 
and
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 and 8 and Sunny should put things right as set 
out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 7 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  these above loans  from Mr Ss credit  file. The period of time 
Mr S owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded about loan this 
loan is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN16954184my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ss complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019.
