The complaint
Miss L complains Evergreen Finance Limited London trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) harassed her after she told MoneyBoat she was having problems repaying the 
loan as well having personal problems.
What happened
Although this is not an unaffordable lending complaint, this complaint stems from a £400 
loan that Miss L was provided with in April 2022. This loan was due to be repaid in six 
instalments. However, based on a statement of account provided by MoneyBoat, as of 
March 2023, only one payment of £99.45 has been made in May 2022. An outstanding 
balance remains due.
Ive provided a timeline as to what has happened with various messages and what
MoneyBoat knew and at what point in time, and then what it did with that information. This
information is drawn both from the screen shots Miss L has provided but also from
MoneyBoats contact notes. I also havent gone into too much detail about what was
discussed as both parties are aware of what was said and I have kept it brief to protect
Miss Ls privacy. But I assure Miss L that I have read everything provided. 
I can see that after the May 2022 payment wasnt made MoneyBoat attempted to call Miss L
three times over the course of three days, these calls were in the morning and not
successful. On 23 May 2022 Miss L says she was being harassed by the calls and text
messages and was in hospital.
Miss L asked that the payment date be moved to the following Monday and MoneyBoat
agreed to this. When this payment wasnt made, MoneyBoat started to message Miss L
again, from 30 May 2022. Calls and messages arent made every day and it does seem
MoneyBoat was trying to establish contact to find out when payment will be made.
On 13 June 2022 Miss L responded to one of MoneyBoats generic messages to say she
had been in and out of hospital and was currently waiting on a diagnosis which should come
through by the end of June 2022. She also explained she was struggling with her mental
health.
MoneyBoat then sent its generic chaser text messages to Miss L most days until
16 June 2022 when Miss L raised a complaint with it because she was being harassed and
MoneyBoat hadnt taken account of her mental health problems shed explained about a few
days before.
I can see on 20 June 2022 within MoneyBoats system it was noted that Miss L was having
some mental health struggles.
Between 28 to 30 June 2022 further messages were received by Miss L and she responded
with details about her health. Miss L asked for the contact to stop and she explained how
these messages were not helping her. Miss L reiterated to MoneyBoat that she was
self-employed and so as she wasnt working, she wasnt being paid.
On 7 July 2022 while her complaint was ongoing Miss L asks for a repayment plan.
13 July 2022, MoneyBoat messages Miss L to see how she was getting on because interest
was being added to her balance due to her not paying. However, on this date, Miss Ls
mother provided MoneyBoat with an update on her mental health and that she is currently in
hospital as a result of the contact shes had from MoneyBoat. MoneyBoat messaged Miss L
explaining that if her mother is contacting it, shell need to be added to her account as a third 
party.
On 27 July 2022 Miss L further reiterated the contact was having an impact on her health 
and then on 8 August 2022 she offered another repayment plan. I can then see from August 
2022 contact does reduce to an email or text message being sent once every two weeks 
letting her know the account is in arrears.
Following Miss Ls complaint, MoneyBoat issued a final response letter (FRL) dealing with
the complaint on 18 July 2022 in which it didnt uphold her complaint. MoneyBoat says that
initially it was told Miss L was in hospital and it therefore moved the repayment that was due
at the end of May 2022.
It says the payment wasnt made and it didnt hear from Miss L again until 13 June 2022
when it was told Miss L had been in hospital and it asked her to contact it to discuss setting
up a repayment plan.
MoneyBoat says it did continue to contact Miss L because the account was in arrears, no
payments had been made and no repayment plan had been put in place. So, it doesnt
believe that it has harassed Miss L. And it also doesnt agree that it sent messages to
Miss Ls workplace because it didnt have any work contact details.
Overall, MoneyBoat believed it had acted correctly and in an appropriate manner. At this
point it explained collection activity would carry on unless or until it could discuss the
repayment options with her.
Unhappy with this response, Miss L referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman at
which point she reiterated that despite MoneyBoat knowing about her mental health
problems it was continuing to contact her about the balance. 
Later on, Miss L told us that she had tried to set up a payment arrangement but MoneyBoat 
kept contacting her and threatening her. She also explained at this point that she was 
seeking to claim a benefit to help her.
The case was considered by an adjudicator who upheld it. He said, that MoneyBoat
was aware of Miss Ls personal situation  which included hospitals stays and details of her
health, yet it continued to send automated messages.
Our adjudicator also couldnt see that there was any further help or assistance offered to
Miss L when MoneyBoat knew she was in a vulnerable position, and he was satisfied that
the repeated automated messages made an already difficult situation worse for Miss L.
Finally, the adjudicator concluded that he didnt believe Miss Ls situation would improve, so 
in order to put things right, he recommended that MoneyBoat write off the outstanding 
balance that was owed to it.
Miss L responded to the assessment saying:She had recently had a number of family bereavements.
Her health has been deteriorating.
Miss L is still receiving threatening messages from MoneyBoat.
She is also concerned because her mother replied to MoneyBoat on two occasions 
while she was in hospital and MoneyBoat continued to message the phone despite it 
knowing her phone was with a third party.
Miss L reiterated that she was self-employed and she had to take two weeks off as
unpaid work due to the worry that MoneyBoat was causing.
Later on, Miss L told us that she had sought help from a well-known charity which offers
guidance to people who need mental health support.
MoneyBoat didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment, and Ive summarised its
response below.
MoneyBoat hasnt received any information or evidence from Miss L about her 
current circumstances to substantiate all shes said.
Miss L has made further loan applications to MoneyBoat  the most recent of these 
was in April 2023  in which she has provided information about her income and 
expenditure.
MoneyBoat reiterated that it cant leave an account in arrears with no payments and 
no action being taken. It has reached out to Miss L but hasnt received any 
information.
As no agreement had been reached on progressing Miss Ls complaint, the case was
passed to me to resolve.
I then issued my provisional decision explaining the reasons why I was intending to uphold 
Miss Ls complaint in part. And my planned resolution wasnt to include that instead of writing 
off the loan balance  as there was no evidence of Miss Ls current financial situation, I felt 
an award for the trouble and upset was reasonable  and recommended a payment of £500. 
Both parties were asked to provide any further information and comments as soon as 
possible, but in any event, no later than 26 May 2023. 
MoneyBoat acknowledged the provisional decision but didnt have anything further to add. 
Miss L responded and Ive read in full what she said, but Ive summarised what she said 
below:
She hadnt made further loan applications. 
Miss L is concerned about dealing with MoneyBoat and she provided some further 
details about her deteriorating health. 
Miss L doesnt want any further contact with MoneyBoat because it says this causes 
her stress which she has been told to avoid. 
The adjudicator put Miss Ls comments to MoneyBoat  it responded to say that it had 
reached out to Miss L at the time but had not received a response back. 
A copy of the provisional findings follows this below in italics and forms part of this final 
decision.
What I said in my provisional decision:Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to start by saying I sorry to hear about Miss Ls mental health problems. As Ive said,
Im not gone into too much detail about and MoneyBoat has been told much the same as we
have up to the point the complaint was referred here.
In saying that, I can quite understand, to begin with why MoneyBoat was contacting
Miss L. She had a loan agreement that needed to be paid and Miss L had missed payments.
So, I do think MoneyBoat was well within its rights to contact Miss L to firstly let her know
shed missed a payment and then to ask how she was going to bring the account up to date.
This was and is entirely reasonably. Ive checked the times and dates of the messages and
while sometimes there were more than one message per day, these werent sent at
unreasonable times. And while, Miss L may have thought that this initial contact constituted
harassment I cant agree given what MoneyBoat was doing and what it knew about Miss Ls
situation.
However, from the end of June 2022, MoneyBoat at the latest was on notice that firstly,
Miss L was having health problems and secondly, the impact that the chaser text messages
and emails were having on her health. On a number of occasions Miss L explained the
impact to it.
Now, I do understand why MoneyBoat was sending those messages, as Ive said the
account was in arrears and it was  to some extend trying to get the payments back on
track. But clearly this wasnt an option for Miss L at the time. And to me it doesnt seem that
it adjusted or changed its communication strategy with Miss L despite being told about her
health. It just carried out as it would ordinarily do  there appears to have been no attempt to
consider whether constantly sending messages was the right course of action for it to take in
the circumstances.
MoneyBoat ought to have by the end of June 2022 recognised that Miss L was a vulnerable
customer and that the Financial Conduct Authority has clear guidance and offers practical
support to business in its Guidance for firms on the fair treatment of vulnerable customers.
To me it doesnt appear that any adjustments or changes were made to the way MoneyBoat
communicated with Miss L after being given information about her health. Indeed, section
4.29 of the guidance, which Ive outlined below indicates the consequences of not getting the service 
needs correct. Clearly in my view this hasnt happened and has in my view increased the distress that 
Miss L was caused.
Customer service 4.29 Vulnerable consumers are more likely to have different
service needs. For example, they may find some channels of communication
challenging or stressful or need more time to understand information and make
decisions. If firms do not ensure their customer service provision meets the needs of
vulnerable consumers, they can exacerbate the risk of harm from being vulnerable.
For example, unresponsive or inflexible customer service can increase the stress and
confusion a consumer may suffer when already dealing with unexpected or
challenging life events.
To further reinforce what Ive said, even after being told about Miss Ls health problems the
FRL was issued and didnt appear to acknowledge what it had been told just days before or
offered any alternative guidance or support beyond saying that there is a loan that needs to
be paid.
Finally, Ive thought about what Miss L says about a possible data protection breach, but
ultimately MoneyBoat was sending text messages to a mobile number that her mother had
access to, although the number belonged to Miss L at the point of the application was made.
While I accept Miss Ls mother updating MoneyBoat about Miss Ls current health, I dont
think MoneyBoats response was unreasonable. Indeed, as far as I can see there hasnt
been any further evidence provided to Miss L about either her current financial position or
her current health condition. So given that the right off, in my view is arguably too much.So, I have had to think about what MoneyBoat does to put things right for Miss L. I disagree
with the adjudicator in this case, in terms of what MoneyBoat needs to do in order to put
things right. And I say that because in order to be satisfied that a total write-off of the debt is
justified, Id need to have seen some evidence to substantiate the history Miss L has
described. And Id need to see that Miss L was having current money troubles that were
unlikely to be alleviated in the future. This will need to be discussed with MoneyBoat and
Miss L may wish to ask a family member, friend or a third-party organisation to assist her
with this.
MoneyBoat has also explained that Miss L is continually applying to it for additional loans
with relatively healthy income and expenditure figures - it has told us. And so that indication
from MoneyBoat suggests that Miss L may be able to afford this debt. In which case it would
need to be paid.
But it is clear, the method and regular nature of the contact had an impact on Miss L and
clearly made what was already a difficult situation even more tricky and stressful for her. I
am therefore proposing that MoneyBoat makes a payment to her of £500.
Miss L has also said that she recently had to take time off work  I believe this was in
March 2023, but while no evidence has been provided of this I cant fairly come to an
outcome about this. But MoneyBoat has said that contact has been suspended while the
complaint is being reviewed at the Financial Ombudsman Service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
So, Ive reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons and Ive 
outlined below what MoneyBoat should do to put things right for Miss L. 
Ive thought about Miss Ls comments, but I do think the award that I am proposing is fair 
and reasonable in this case, because it reflects the trouble and upset that was clearly 
caused to her by MoneyBoat not adapting or adjusting to the information she was providing 
to it about her vulnerability. 
Im sorry to hear about Miss Ls deteriorating health and why she is worried about engaging 
with MoneyBoat. But the loan is currently outstanding and so she may wish to approach 
MoneyBoat (or ask a representative to do so on her behalf) and provide it with further details 
about her health. I say this because MoneyBoat will need to react and consider what the 
most appropriate course of action is  which may or may not including writing the balance off 
 but to be clear I make no direction as to whether MoneyBoat needs to do this. 
An outstanding balance is still due to MoneyBoat and I would urge Miss L to engage with it 
to discuss a way forward. But I would remind MoneyBoat of its regulatory obligation to treat 
Miss L fairly in any dealings with her  and it does, need to keep all available forbearance 
options open. 
Putting things right
I am satisfied for the reasons Ive outlined above that after being told about Miss Ls health
problems MoneyBoat didnt reacted or adjusted its communication with Miss L and that 
communication with Miss L was clearly compounding what was already a difficult situation 
for her. Therefore, in order to put things right, MoneyBoat should do the following:
Pay directly to Miss L £500 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Miss Ls 
complaint in part.
Evergreen Finance Limited London trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk should put things right for 
Miss L as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2023.
