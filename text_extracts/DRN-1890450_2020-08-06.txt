Our adjudicator reviewed Miss Ms complaint and thought that the loans from loan 4 onwards 
should be upheld. The adjudicator said this because they thought the overall pattern of       
Miss Ms borrowing indicated she was reliant on these loans and the borrowing was 
becoming unsustainable. 
Morses disagreed. It said that Miss M used the loans in line with a typical customer for this 
type of loan. And that its checks showed the loans were affordable and her pattern of 
borrowing didnt indicate that she was using the loans as another source of income. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss 
M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Morses was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Miss Ms complaint about loans 1 to 3. Miss M hasnt provided 
any further evidence or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further 
findings on these loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Morses lending history with Miss M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ms case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 4. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Miss M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss M had taken out four loans in nearly two years. So, it should 
have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that     
Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £100 and loan 4 was for £300. At this point Morses ought 
to have known it was unlikely Miss M was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 4 onwards Miss M was provided with a new loan either on the same day 
she repaid a previous one  or shortly afterwards. She also often had loans running 
concurrently which would have been increasing her weekly outgoings. 
Miss M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 14 
was taken out nearly five years after Miss Ms first. Miss M had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to Morses over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ms ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Miss Ms complaint about loan 4 onwards and Morses should put things 
right. 
Putting things right
If Morses has sold the outstanding debt Morses should buy this back if Morses is able to do 
so and then take the following steps. If Morses cant buy the debt back, then Morses should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss M towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
Morses has already refunded.
B) Morses should calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by 
Miss M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss M originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 14, and 
treat any repayments made by Miss M as though they had been repayments of the principal on this loan. If this results in Miss M having made overpayments then Morses should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Morses should 
then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on loan 14. If this results in a surplus, then the 
surplus should be paid to Miss M. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 
Morses should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss M. Morses shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal Morses has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Miss Ms borrowing for loans 4 to 14 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Morses should remove these loans entirely from        
Miss Ms credit file. Morses does not have to remove loan 14 from Miss Ms credit file until 
this has been repaid, but Morses should still remove any adverse information recorded about 
the loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to take off tax from this interest. Morses must give Miss M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
Im partially upholding Miss Ms complaint. Morses Club PLC should put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 September 2020.
