The complaint
Mr R is unhappy with NewDay Ltds administration of his credit card accounts.
What happened
Mr R holds two credit card accounts with NewDay  one Aqua card and a marbles card. 
Each card has a different rate of interest.
Both of Mr Rs credit card accounts are currently under paydown plans in line with the rules 
set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regarding persistent debt. This means Mr R 
pays a required amount each month (calculated by NewDay) to pay off the outstanding 
balances within a reasonable period.
The background leading up to the paydown plans isnt in dispute. So, Ill focus on the key 
aspects of Mr Rs complaint below: 
Mr R complained to NewDay. He said he was unhappy it charged different rates of interest 
on the two cards and thought it should be the same lower amount given he was the same 
customer that had applied for both cards.
NewDay responded to Mr Rs complaint. It offered Mr R £15 compensation for the delay in 
responding but didnt think it had done anything wrong in how it had administered each 
account. It said that each card had been applied for at different times, and the interest rates 
were set by its risk department and reflected Mr Rs circumstances at the time of each 
application.
NewDay subsequently suspended Mr Rs cards to prevent further spending as it said it was 
concerned it wouldnt be affordable to Mr R based on his current balance and financial 
standing.
Mr R didnt agree and referred his complaint to our service. He added that NewDay had 
since increased the monthly amounts required in the paydown plans which was unfair and 
unreasonable. Mr R proposed to NewDay that his debts be consolidated into one single 
amount with a lower rate of interest, and that he repaid £180 per month toward this. NewDay 
didnt accept this offer as it said Mr R hadnt missed any payments or shown any signs of 
financial difficulty. 
Our investigator looked at everything and didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. They 
concluded it was reasonable for NewDay to treat each credit card as a separate contract 
with its own interest rate, in line with the credit agreement Mr R signed. And they concluded 
NewDay had acted fairly in requesting higher payments under the paydown plan due to      
Mr Rs additional spending on the cards, and the need for the amount to be repaid in a 
reasonable period.
Our investigator also concluded it was reasonable for NewDay to request evidence of 
financial difficulty, such as an income and expenditure assessment, before it considered any 
forbearance options with Mr R.
Mr R disagreed, in addition to the above points he said in summary:
As the issue had stemmed from a persistent debt situation, it went without saying that 
NewDay should know his funds are limited.
The credit cards shouldnt be treated separately because NewDay suspended them 
on the same day. So, this shows that internally it treated both cards the same in 
terms of risk.
He had further concerns about the increased payments required under the paydown 
plans and how NewDay had calculated them. And he wanted NewDay to revert to the 
original amounts agreed when the paydown plan started, and at the lower of the two 
interest rates.
It was permissible for the debt to take longer than 48 months to pay off within the 
FCAs guidelines on persistent debt.
The complaint has now been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Were an informal service, so whilst I have read everything Mr Rs provided, I am not going 
to comment on each individual point. Rather, I will focus on the key issues relevant to my 
decision.
Separate rates of interest
Having considered the evidence from NewDay, Im persuaded that it hasnt acted 
unreasonably in providing different interest rates for each credit card. I say this because I 
find the rates of interest are clearly set out on the application for each card. And I can see 
that each card is clearly marketed as a separate product. Ultimately, NewDay can do this 
and it isnt unreasonable.
I understand the point Mr R is making about NewDay suspending both cards on the same 
day. But I dont agree this means his higher interest rate should be reduced as a result. The 
interest rates were reflective of the risk at the time of each application and relative to the 
product. Ultimately, Mr R agreed to those interest rates when he took each card out, and as 
Ive concluded the terms of interest were clear, I think Mr R wouldve reasonably been aware 
of the different interest rates on the Aqua and marbles card before he agreed to those terms 
each time.
The terms of each card do say, We may change these and also introduce new charges and 
fees which may affect the APR at any time by giving you notice. But I cant see anything in 
the terms which state that NewDay is obliged to reduce the interest rate upon review. 
NewDay has said it will continue to review each account and if a reduction in interest rate is 
available in the future it will let Mr R know. I think this is reasonable in the circumstances.
Increased payments under the paydown plans
Ive next determined whether NewDay has acted fairly and reasonably, and in line with the 
relevant regulations set out in the FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC), when 
calculating Mr Rs monthly repayments on the paydown plan.NewDays position is that it increased Mr Rs payments in order to ensure he can pay off the 
balance in a reasonable period of 48 months. And it says the increases were linked to 
additional spending on each card before it was suspended, and more recently a late 
payment fee (after the complaint had been referred to our service).
Mr Rs position is that the additional spend was modest. He wants NewDay to revert to the 
previously arranged payments on each card but using the lower of the two interest rates. 
And he says that if this means it takes longer than 48 months to pay down, then so be it.
There are a number of CONC rules which apply here, and Ill summarise the relevant part to 
this complaint below. The full wording can be found within the FCAs Handbook online. 
Its not in dispute that the FCAs persistent debt guidance applies to each account, so Ill 
focus on Mr Rs concerns regarding the amounts in the paydown plans.
CONC 6.7.33 states:
(1) The aim of the options a firm sets out under CONC 6.7.31R(3) [which includes provision 
of a paydown plan] should be that the consumer repays the balance in a reasonable period.
(2) The FCA expects a reasonable period under paragraph (1)to usually be between 
three and four years. Only in exceptional circumstances should the repayment period 
extend beyond four years (my emphasis in bold).
So, I think this shows NewDay is required to ensure the balance can repaid in a reasonable 
time of 4 years. And Ive not seen anything which would lead me to conclude exceptional 
circumstances apply in this case.
Both the terms of each credit card account, and the paydown plan letters NewDay sent to   
Mr R, contain information about how use of the card would likely affect the contractual 
minimum payments:
If we allow you to continue to use your account after we have set up a PayDown Plan, we 
will also increase the contractual minimum payment you need to make in respect of any new 
balances.
The PayDown Plan monthly instalment will be included as part of your contractual minimum 
payment, so please check your statement each month for the payment you need to make 
and remember any additional spending on your account will incur a higher contractual 
minimum payment.NewDay has shown our service how the additional spend and late payment fees have 
increased the repayment amounts to ensure Mr R can paydown the balance in 4 years. Im 
satisfied this is in line with the rules set out above. So, I think that this shows NewDay acted 
correctly in increasing Mr Rs payments to ensure he could paydown the balance in a 
reasonable period. And I think the information it provided was clear in explaining the 
paydown plan repayments would be linked to any additional spend. Overall, I find NewDay 
has acted fairly here.
Next steps
Mr R says that NewDay should know his funds are limited, and hes said it should show him 
forbearance and agree to his reduced repayment proposals.
I can see our investigator has attempted to mediate between the parties in order to help 
reach an agreement. But as the matter stands, Mr R hasnt provided any evidence to 
NewDay that hes unable to make the required payments under the paydown plan. So, as 
Ive determined that NewDay can fairly request these amounts, I wont require it to do 
anything further here.
However, since the complaint has been raised with our service, its not clear to me whether 
Mr R is choosing to make less than the required repayments as a result of his dispute with 
NewDay, or whether hes unable to due to his circumstances. The rules do say that NewDay 
must take appropriate action where there are signs of actual or possible financial difficulties, 
and its required to treat Mr R with forbearance and due consideration should the account fall 
into default or arrears. 
So, should Mr R be unable to make less than the required repayments, I would expect 
NewDay to step in and treat him with forbearance in line with the relevant rules. And should 
this happen, its reasonable for NewDay to require further information about what Mr R can 
sustainably afford to repay. And I would encourage Mr R to engage with the process.
In conclusion, I dont think NewDay has acted unreasonably, so I dont uphold this complaint, 
and I wont require it to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about NewDay Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
