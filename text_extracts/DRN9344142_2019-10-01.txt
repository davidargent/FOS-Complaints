Miss Cs representative says that the lending was irresponsible  and that Sunny should  have 
realised that Miss C wouldnt be able to repay  the loans  without  borrowing  more. It says 
Miss C was in a spiral  of debt taking out new loans to repay existing ones.
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  it carried out affordability and credit 
worthiness checks.  
Our adjudicator didnt  think she had seen enough  to say that loans one to five shouldnt  have 
been provided. However by the time loan six was provided she thought  that Miss Cs overall  
pattern of borrowing suggested  she had become persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
Because of this she recommended  that the interest  and charges applied  to loans six to 13 
were refunded along with interest.
Sunny didnt accept  our adjudicators view.  It said that the repayments on the loans 
averaged 3% of Miss Cs monthly income.  It said that there  wasnt evidence to suggest that 
by loan six, Miss C was dependent on the loans or that the loans werent  sustainably  
affordable. It said that based on the information  it gathered the loans were affordable and 
that Miss C didnt experience issues with her repayments.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss C 
Ref: DRN93441422could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that there was enough evidence to say that the first five loans  
shouldnt have been provided and I agree  with this. However, by the time loan six was 
provided I think that Sunny should have  had concerns about Miss Cs possible dependency 
on short  term loans. I say this because Miss C had taken out six loans in around a year often  
taking out new loans before the previous loan had been repaid. This suggests  Miss C was 
experiencing difficulty managing her money and raises concerns that she was borrowing 
again in order  to make her repayments.
Given Miss Cs pattern of borrowing I dont  this that is was reasonable to consider loans  six 
onwards as being sustainably affordable. The loan amounts didnt reduce significantly over 
this time further suggesting a reliance on the loans. Because of this I uphold this complaint in 
regard to loans  six to 13.
Ref: DRN93441423my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  six to13. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Miss C towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans six to 13, including payments made to a third party  where applicable, but 
not including  anything that has already been refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Miss C which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Miss C originally made  the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) pay Miss C the total of "A" plus "B".
D) The overall pattern  of Miss Cs borrowing for loans six to 13 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so these loans should be removed from Miss Cs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) to 
deduct tax from this interest.  It should give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax has 
been deducted, if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 November  2019.
