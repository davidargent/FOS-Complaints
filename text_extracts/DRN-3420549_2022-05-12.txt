The complaint
Mr B has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to make it clear 
that by agreeing to a repayment plan to clear his overdraft, this would have a negative 
impact on his credit file.
Mr B says that his circumstances meant that he was vulnerable and that NatWest failed to 
take this into account when dealing with him.
What happened
NatWest apologised that it wasnt made clear to Mr B that agreeing to a repayment plan 
would impact his credit file. NatWest agreed to remove the adverse information from Mr Bs 
credit file and also paid him £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused to him by this 
matter and also credited £63.71 into his account to cover debt interest that had accrued on 
the account.
Unhappy with NatWests response to his complaint, Mr B referred his complaint to our 
service. One of our adjudicators assessed the complaint, and they thought that what 
NatWest had done to put matters right was reasonable in the circumstances. 
Mr B disagreed with the adjudicators findings, and so the matter was referred for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having weighed everything up, I think that what NatWest did to put matters right was 
reasonable. And so I wont be asking NatWest to do anything more (than it has already 
agreed to do) to put matters right in this case.
Looking at all of the responses that the consumer has sent us, it seems that Mr B is most 
aggrieved about a conversation he had with NatWest that led to him agreeing to a 
repayment plan. Unfortunately, our service has not been provided with a copy of this call, 
and looking through NatWests file, it seems it is unable to locate the call recording.
Nevertheless, Mr B has said that he felt pressured into agreeing to a repayment plan and he 
says that by doing so, NatWest took advantage of a vulnerable consumer. However, Im not 
persuaded that NatWest was taking advantage of Mr B, if it did suggest (even strongly) that 
he set up a repayment plan instead of repayment in full. 
The reason why I say this is because by August 2021, Mr B essentially only had two options 
available to him to avoid the account from defaulting. They were to either repay the amount 
owed in full, or to gradually repay the amount owed under a repayment plan. And it would be 
more in NatWests interests to obtain immediate repayment of the overdrawn balance in full, 
rather than agree to instalments over a long period of time. Afterall, whenever a repayment 
plan is agreed between a financial business and a consumer, there is always a risk that a 
consumers circumstances could change over the course of the repayment plan, resulting in 
the financial business not getting back the full amount owed. So I think that by agreeing to 
setup a repayment plan, NatWest was trying to be accommodating and provide Mr B with a 
reasonable solution to clearing the debt. 
Therefore, Im unable to say that NatWest was trying to take advantage of Mr B, or was 
being unreasonable, if it agreed that Mr B could set up a repayment plan as an alternative to 
him repaying the full outstanding balance in one go. 
Having said that, its not in dispute that when the repayment plan was agreed, NatWest 
failed to make it clear to Mr B that this could lead to adverse information being recorded on 
Mr Bs credit file. And NatWest has been clear from the outset that this shouldve been 
explained to Mr B. But had things gone as they shouldve, I think that Mr B wouldve repaid 
the full amount owed. And this is exactly what did happen shortly after hed agreed to the 
repayment plan. So I cant see that Mr B had lost out financially from the error.
Furthermore, to put matters right, NatWest says it amended Mr Bs credit file. NatWest has 
provided a record of this information and Im satisfied that NatWest has removed any 
evidence that an arrangement to repay was in place on the account in question. 
NatWest also agreed to pay Mr B £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused and also 
credited £63.71 to his account as a gesture of goodwill, to refund interest that had accrued 
on his account. 
Having considered what NatWest offered, alongside what Mr B has told us about his 
circumstances, overall I think NatWests offer was reasonable in the circumstances. I say 
this especially as NatWest was able to rectify matters with Mr B relatively quickly i.e. four 
days, after the discussion about the repayment plan took place.
My final decision
Because of the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint and therefore dont 
require NatWest to do anything further, beyond what it had agreed to do in its final response 
letter, to put matters right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
