Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ps complaint in part and thought from loan 3 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Mr Lender didnt agree and so Mr Ps complaint has been 
passed to me, an ombudsman, to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr 
P could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts 
and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);

the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of 
time during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to 
establish whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be 
able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should 
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
I agree with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there was nothing to indicate 
Mr Lender needed to do more when it approved loans 1 and 2. It asked Mr P for details 
about his income and expenditure. It also says it carried out a credit check. I think these 
checks were proportionate for these two loans. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between Mr P and Mr Lender. The repayments for each loan would have 
seemed affordable based on what Mr P had told it. So, I dont think Mr Lender was wrong 
to give these loans to him.
However, I dont think Mr Lender carried out proportionate checks for loan 3. I say this 
because Mr P had been lending from it for around 6 months and the amount he was 
asking to borrow was significantly higher than his first loan (from £500 up to £900). He 
was also asking to lend over a longer period of time (over 6 months rather than 3 
months). I think Mr Lender should have, at this point carried out a complete review of Mr 
Ps finances.
Had Mr Lender done so, I think it would most likely have made a different lending decision 
about this loan and for all of the loans took out by Mr P going forward. I say this because 
Mr Lender would have seen with better checks that there were clear signs that Mr P was 
struggling to manage his money. At the same time as applying for loan 3, Mr P had taken 
out short-term high cost credit from five other lenders. So, it was most likely he was just 
borrowing to pay off other loans.
It follows that I dont think Mr Lender should have given loan 3 and every loan agreed 
after this point to Mr P.Ive then looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history with Mr P, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ps case, I again agree with the adjudicator 
and think that this point was reached at loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender ought to have realised Mr P was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr P had taken out five loans within 28 months and was 
asking for a sixth. I think it was more likely than not Mr P had to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Mr Lender. Mr 
Lender ought to have known that Mr P was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. Mr P had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to Mr Lender over an 
extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted Mr Lender to the likelihood 
that Mr P was having problems managing his money. I think that Mr Lender 
shouldve been concerned that Mr P might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its 
loans, again increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr P lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 6 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period of time.
The number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So in conclusion, Im upholding Mr Ps complaint from loans 3 onwards and because 
of this, Mr Lender should put things right.
  
Putting things right
  refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 3 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 3-5 from Mr Ps credit file
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 6 to 8 should be 
removed from Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must 
give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
 For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ps complaint. PDL Finance Limited (trading 
as Mr Lender) should pay Mr P compensation as set out above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2021.
