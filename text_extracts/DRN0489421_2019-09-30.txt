K821x#15complaint
Mr K complains that MYJAR  Limited  lent to him in an irresponsible  manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  
11 September 2019, an extract  of which is attached  and forms part of this final decision.  So I 
wont repeat  that information here.  
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I thought  Mr Ks complaint should be upheld  in 
relation to loans  six to 19. I invited both parties to let me have any further comments  and 
evidence. MYJAR agreed with my provisional  decision.  Mr K said he had nothing  further  to 
add. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Mr K nor MYJAR  has provided  me with anything further, I see no reason 
to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  So, I dont think that 
MYJAR should have  given Mr K loans six to 19. To put things right,  MYJAR  should take the 
steps I set out in my provisional  decision.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ks complaint in 
part. I now require MYJAR Limited to:
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans six to 19 and write off any
outstanding interest  and charges on loan 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct from the refund and interest  above any capital sum still due and pay Mr K the
balance;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans six to 19 should  be removed from
Mr Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must
give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask  Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 October  2019.

Mr K complains that MYJAR  Limited  lent to him in an irresponsible  manner.
background
MYJARs records show that it gave Mr K 19 loans between January  2010 and March 2011.
On six occasions,  the records show two loans  of £100 on the same date. MYJAR says it
showed those  loans as two separate  loans of £100, rather than one loan of £200,  as its
systems at the time couldnt  process  that as one loan. It appears  that Mr K hasnt repaid the
final loan. A summary  of Mr Ks borrowing from MYJAR is shown as an appendix to this
decision.
Mr K says that the loans made his debt problem worse and he had to borrow  further to repay
them. He wants a refund  of all interest and charges.
One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Ks complaint. She said that MYJAR shouldnt  have
given Mr K loans seven to 19. That was because, by loan seven, the pattern of borrowing
itself showed that the loans were unsustainable.  The adjudicator set out what MYJAR  should
do to put matters right.
MYJAR didnt agree  with the adjudicator. It said that the adjudicator  hadnt  explained how
she had come to her conclusion or on what evidence shed relied. MYJAR said it wasnt
clear that the adjudicator had reviewed  the information it had provided.
As there was no agreement between the parties, the complaint was passed to me, an
ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr K
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN04894213But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance  defined
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular, the customer  should be able
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context including  MYJARs submission and what  this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
I dont think that MYJAR was wrong  to give Mr K loans one to five. Based on what  Ive seen,
I cant say that proportionate checks would  likely  have shown that the lending was
unsustainable.
Ive looked what  MYJAR  has said about  the steps it took before lending to Mr K and the
checks it carried. Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Mr Ks lending  history with MYJAR,
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. Given the particular  circumstances
of Mr Ks case, I think that this point was reached by loan six. Loan  six was one of two loans
Mr K took out on that date. By loan six, Mr K had been borrowing from MYJAR  for seven
months.
From loan six onwards,  Mr K was provided with a new loan within weeks  of settling a
previous one. So MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Mr K was having
to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and
that Mr Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN04894214Mr K wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 19 was taken out
over 13 months after Mr Ks first loan and it was for a larger amount. Mr K had paid large
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service an intermittent debt to MYJAR over an extended
period.
I think that Mr K lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness  by
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of
time. In addition, the sheer number of loans may have  had negative  implications on Mr Ks
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans six to 19 and MYJAR should  put things right. As
Mr K hasnt repaid  loan 19, MYJAR  may deduct from the refund any capital outstanding from
that loan.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans six to 19 and write off any
outstanding interest  and charges on loan 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
deduct from the refund and interest  above any capital sum still due and pay Mr K the
balance;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans six to 19 should  be removed from
Mr Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must
give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off, if he asks for one.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  given  above, I intend to uphold Mr Ks complaint in part. I intend to require
MYJAR Limited to pay Mr K compensation as set out above.
