The complaint
Mrs and Mr B complain that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) did not fairly 
compensate them after it mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). 
What happened
PPI was sold to Mrs and Mr B alongside a mortgage in or around 2001. The PPI was initially 
sold to cover both Mrs and Mr B. So that means 50% of the mortgage repayments would 
have been covered if Mr B or Mrs B was off sick from work or if they lost their jobs. If they 
had both been made redundant or were off sick at the same time, 100% of the mortgage 
repayments would have been covered. 
I understand Mrs B was removed from the policy in July 2004. From that point onwards, only 
Mr B was covered by the PPI policy. So if Mr B was off sick from work or if he lost his job, 
100% of the mortgage repayments would have been covered. 
RBS told us that several successful claims were made on the PPI policy as follows: 
Date claim started Date claim ended Value of claim (£)
4 August 2004 16 August 2005 3,441
18 July 2007 11 June 2008 3,600
9 December 2009 6 May 2010 3,600
16 October 2013 9 October 2014 4,099.56
22 May 2015 30 March 2016 4,681.22
TOTAL 19,421.78
RBS also told us the insurer had rejected a claim made by Mr B in 2006. 
Mrs and Mr B dispute they made five successful claims. They say only three claims were 
made and the value of those claims was approximately £12,000. 
Sometime later, Mrs and Mr B complained to RBS that it had mis-sold PPI. On 5 June 2020, 
it wrote to Mr B to say that it had upheld the complaint. But it said no compensation was due 
to Mrs and Mr B because the value of the claims theyd made was more than they paid in 
PPI premiums. 
On 14 May 2021, RBS wrote to Mrs and Mr B to say it had undertaken a review of the 
rejected 2006 claim. It said Mr B would have reasonably expected this claim to be paid and 
that claims like this usually lasted for five months. So, it offered to pay to Mrs and Mr B five 
months premiums, which came to £1,708.15. Along with additional statutory interest, RBS 
total net offer was £3,362.98. 
In the letter of 14 May 2021, RBS also made reference to what sometimes happened when 
there was a joint mortgage. It said it had calculated the claim amount on the assumption that 
each policyholder was earning 50% of their joint income. Mrs and Mr B understood this 
paragraph to mean that RBS had only paid half of the compensation that was due. They did 
not accept the assurances of RBS to the contrary and so they complained to this service. 
Our adjudicator considered all of this. He thought the offer RBS made was a fair way to 
settle the complaint. Mrs and Mr B did not agree with this view. They said only three claims 
had been made and the value of those claims was not £19,421. As I said above, I 
understand they valued the claims at £12,000. 
As Mrs and Mr B did not agree with our adjudicators view, the matter has been passed to 
me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs and Mr B, but I havent upheld their complaint. Ill explain why 
below. 
As the parties agree PPI was mis-sold, I dont have to decide what happened at the point of 
sale. Im looking at whether Mrs and Mr B have been fairly compensated for that mis-sale. 
Was the claim value more than the PPI premiums paid? 
I can see there has been some considerable discussion about how much was paid to Mrs 
and Mr B in respect of the PPI claims. RBS says they were paid £19,421.78. I understand 
Mrs and Mr B told our adjudicator they were paid approximately of £12,000. 
RBS agrees PPI was mis-sold. So, in such circumstances, I would expect it to return Mrs 
and Mr B to the position they would be in if PPI had never been sold in the first place. To do 
that, RBS would need to calculate how much Mrs and Mr B paid for their premiums, and add 
statutory interest. Looking at the letter RBS sent to Mrs and Mr B on 5 June 2020, I can see 
it undertook those steps. It worked out that Mrs and Mr B would have been due £2,666.70. 
But RBS did not pay this money to Mrs and Mr B. Thats because it said they had made 
successful claims and the value of those claims was more than £2,666.70. I think it was fair 
for RBS to do this. As I said above, the purpose of compensating Mrs and Mr B is to put 
them in the position they would have been in if PPI had never been sold in the first place. If 
RBS paid this back to Mrs and Mr B, they would be in a better position. Thats because they 
would have been able to benefit from the policy by making some successful claims, as well 
as getting all of their premiums back. I cant reasonably say that would be fair. 
As I said above, Mrs and Mr B do not agree with the figures RBS provided to us about the 
value of the claims. They estimate the value of their claims to be in the region of £12,000. 
Even if I accept Mrs and Mr Bs valuation, they would have still received more for their claims 
than the £2,666.70 RBS calculated they were owed for the mis-sold PPI. So I cant say RBS 
owes Mrs and Mr B anything more in respect of the upheld complaint of 5 June 2020. 
Offer for the declined claim
I have considered the offer RBS made to Mrs and Mr B in respect of the declined claim. 
While I can see how the RBS letter of 14 May 2021 caused some confusion. I am satisfied 
that the offer is fair. 
Mrs and Mr Bs PPI policy was set up to cover their mortgage repayments if Mr B couldnt 
work. So the monthly benefit is based on their monthly mortgage repayment. At times, it also 
covers other costs associated with the home, such as buildings insurance. RBS based its 
offer on the monthly benefit of the PPI being £341.63. This is consistent with 100% of the 
monthly PPI benefit. 
If the £1,708.15 (£341.63 x 5) represented only 50% of the claim to be paid as alleged by 
Mrs and Mr B, that would mean they would have been covered for almost £700 per month. That is not in line with what Ive seen about their cover or their mortgage repayments at the 
relevant time. I think the amount they were covered for was most likely £341.63 per month. 
And that is what RBS based its offer on. So I am satisfied the offer in respect of the declined 
claim is fair. 
It is not clear to me whether RBS has paid this amount to Mrs and Mr B yet. If Mrs and Mr B 
accept my decision, RBS will need to update the 8% compensatory interest up until the date 
Mrs and Mr B get that money back. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint about The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc because I am satisfied its 
offer is fair. However, if The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc has not yet paid Mrs and Mr B, it 
must update the 8% compensatory interest to be paid up to the date Mrs and Mr B get that 
money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
