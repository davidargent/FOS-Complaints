DRN-4006374
The complaint
D, a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
unreasonably deactivated its account and then couldnt reassure D that it wouldnt happen 
again. 
Mr W, a director of D brings this complaint on Ds behalf. 
What happened
D has a business bank account with NatWest. Mr W says that after NatWest placed a block 
on Ds account, he struggled to get help. Mr W says that D couldnt pay its employees, a 
standing order wasnt paid and materials couldnt be purchased. Mr W wanted someone 
from NatWest to contact him to reassure him that the problem wouldnt happen in the future.
NatWest agreed that it couldve been clearer about what additional information D needed to 
provide for its business profile as part of a know your business exercise. And that it gave D 
the wrong information about when the restriction would be lifted. NatWest apologised for Ds 
experience, paid £400 compensation, and waived an unpaid charge fee. NatWest also 
offered to consider any evidence of losses incurred by D while the restriction in place.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ds complaint be upheld. She explained that 
NatWest has the right to carry out reviews of its customers businesses and that it needs to 
keep up to date customer records. The terms of Ds account allow NatWest to restrict access 
if it believes it might be breaching a law or regulation. As HSBC didnt have enough 
information about D, the investigator thought NatWest acted within its rights when it 
restricted the account.
The investigator thought that NatWests compensation payment of £400 together with its 
offer to cover other financial losses if D could provide evidence of these, was fair. She didnt 
ask NatWest to take any more steps to put things right for D. 
The investigator also explained that NatWest couldnt guarantee that it wouldnt restrict Ds 
account in the future if its requests for further information werent responded to in time. 
However, the investigator told D that if in future it provides information to NatWest by any 
stated deadline, there should be no reason to restrict Ds account again.
Mr W doesnt understand why the investigator considers £400 was suitable and points out 
that NatWest paid it without any notice or apology. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should first say that NatWest needs to make sure that it has up to date information for its 
business customers. So, it wasnt wrong for NatWest to ask D to provide further information. 
Im also satisfied that NatWest wrote to D to request the additional information. 
As D didnt update its business profile in time, I dont find that NatWest acted unreasonably 
when it restricted Ds account. However, theres also no dispute that NatWest thinks it 
couldve been clearer with D about the information it required So, my decision focusses on 
whether NatWest has already done and offered enough to put things right for D.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr W but I consider NatWests compensation payment of £400 was 
fair. Particularly when taken with NatWests offer to consider evidence of any financial losses 
by D. 
A £400 payment is at the lower end of the range of award this service might make where the 
mistake has caused significant inconvenience. In Ds case, if NatWest had been clearer, D 
might have provided the right information in time to avoid its account being restricted. So, I 
agree that although the restriction only lasted two days, the impact was significant and 
NatWests award reflects this. 
Although Mr W is unhappy with the way that NatWest made the payment, I dont think this 
means the offer wasnt fair. I also agree with the investigator that I cant require NatWest to 
guarantee that Ds account will never again be restricted. This would depend on whether D 
responds in time should NatWest decide to carry out another know your business review in 
the future. All I would say by way of reassurance is that if it happens again and D thinks 
NatWest has acted unfairly, D could complain.
I leave it with Mr W to decide whether he wants to take up NatWests offer to consider any 
financial losses D might have suffered when its account was restricted. As NatWest has 
said, this would require further evidence from D which this service doesnt have. But overall, 
I think NatWest responded fairly and reasonably to Ds concerns so I dont require it to do 
more than it already has.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint in the sense that NatWest has already 
done enough to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
