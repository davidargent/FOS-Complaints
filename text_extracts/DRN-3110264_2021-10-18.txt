The complaint
Ms M complains AvantCredit of UK, LLC didnt complete reasonable and proportionate 
checks when accepting her for a loan.
Ms M also says she suffered distress and inconvenience because of AvantCredits actions in 
pursuing her for payment of the loan when she was in a Protected Trust Deed (PTD).
What happened
Ms M was accepted for a loan with AvantCredit in December 2013. The loan was for £1,500 
over a period of 36 months. The repayments were around £207 a month and the loan had a 
total repayable value of around £7,450 once interest was added.
Ms M brought her complaint to our service when it couldnt be resolved with AvantCredit.
In summary, Ms M didnt think AvantCredit lent to her responsibly as she said it didnt 
complete reasonable and proportionate checks before accepting her for the loan. She also 
said AvantCredit pursued her for payment to the loan when it knew she was in a PTD.
One of our investigators reviewed Ms Ms complaint and upheld it. He said AvantCredit 
hadnt completed reasonable and proportionate checks when accepting Ms M for the loan. 
He said had it done so it would have seen Ms M wasnt a suitable candidate to lend to. He 
also noted that AvantCredit had continuously communicated with Ms M for her monthly 
payments after it became aware she was in a PTD. Because of this our investigator also 
recommended AvantCredit compensate Ms M £300 for the distress and inconvenience this 
had caused her. 
Ms M accepted our investigators recommendations. AvantCredit agreed in part. It accepted 
it shouldnt have lent to Ms M and agreed with our investigators recommendations about 
what it needed to do to put things right there. But it didnt agree with the amount of 
compensation our investigator recommended for the distressed it caused by continuing to 
communicate with Ms M when it knew she was in a PTD.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
AvantCredit accepted our investigators findings about the sale of the loan and has already 
put things right for Ms M in line with the investigators recommendations. As there is no 
longer a dispute about the sale of the loan, my decision will focus on Ms Ms complaint that 
AvantCredit chased her for payment when it knew she was in a PTD.
 
Ms M told AvantCredit she was insolvent and had appointed a trustee to manage her 
finances in early January 2014. AvantCredit became aware Ms M was in a PTD in early 
February 2014 as the contact notes it has provided to our service confirm this. There is also 
a note that shows Ms Ms trustee contacted AvantCredit directly on 13 February 2014 asking 
it to stop further contact with Ms M.
The very nature of a PTD is to shield the individual from creditors contacting them for 
payment of their debts. The trustee manages the relationship with the creditors, including 
arranging payments. Under the conditions of the PTD AvantCredit was legally bound not to 
contact Ms M directly for any payments towards the loan while she was in the PTD. 
Ive seen AvantCredit continued its correspondence with Ms M after it became aware of the 
PTD. Between late February and early March 2014 it sent a number of payment reminders 
directly to Ms M. The payment reminders sent in March 2014 were followed by several 
payment overdue notices. Each of these payment overdue notices requested Ms M contact 
AvantCredit directly to arrange payment to her loan. So, its clear AvantCredit were 
contacting Ms M when it shouldnt have been. And it hasnt disputed this.
I need to consider what impact AvantCredit contacting Ms M when it shouldnt have been is 
likely to have had on Ms M and whether any compensation is due to her as a result of this.
Ms M has said this continued contact impacted her mental health and she ultimately 
borrowed money from family in March 2020 in order to settle the loan in full and stop 
AvantCredits contact.
Ms M was already in a position of personal and financial distress at the point she entered the 
PTD. Its likely continued demands for payment from AvantCredit, on many different 
occasions, would have been distressing for her. Indeed, shes told us that she was so 
distressed by the contact from AvantCredit, to make it stop she felt the need to reach out to 
family members to borrow money to settle the loan  even though she was already in a PTD 
at this point. I think this shows she wasnt taking things lightly and the impact on her wasnt 
minimal.
AvantCredit hasnt explained why it disagrees with our investigators recommendation to pay 
£300 to compensate Ms M for the distress its caused her. Its never acknowledged its done 
something wrong or apologised to Ms M. Having considered everything, I agree with the 
investigator. I think £300 is fair compensation for the distress AvantCredit caused Ms M by 
contacting her when it shouldnt have done.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Im upholding Ms Ms complaint about AvantCredit of UK, 
LLC. It should pay Ms M £300 compensation for the distress it has caused her.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
