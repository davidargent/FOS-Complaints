One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint details and thought that Provident should put 
things right for Mrs N in relation to Loans 4 to 13. We are not able to adjudicate on Loan 1 as 
it pre-dates our authority  to do so. 
Provident has not responded. Mrs N has not disagreed with our adjudicators  view.  The 
complaint was passed to me for a decision. I do not plan to review loans 1 to 3 although 
I have referred to the regulatory situation, in brief, which covers the time from 2008.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints on our website. These include  all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice about high cost credit lending - including  for home credit.
These loans for Mrs N date back to April 2008  (Loan 2) and at that time businesses were  
licensed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).  Section  25 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974  
Ref: DRN08822192(as amended) (the CCA) required the OFT to ensure that consumer  credit  licences were 
only given to  and retained  by  those who were  fit to hold them. 
Section 25(2) of the CCA contained  specific matters which (alongside any matters  it 
considered to be relevant) the OFT should have regard to when determining  whether an 
applicant for a licence  was a fit person to hold one. One of which, section 25(2) (d) outlined 
the evidence of the kind mentioned in subsection (2A). 
Subsection 2A (e) listed:
engaged in business  practices  appearing to the OFT to be deceitful or oppressive or 
otherwise unfair or improper  (whether unlawful or not).
Subsection 2B went on to provide an example of the type of business  practice  referred to in 
subsection 2A (e). It said:
For the purposes of subsection (2A) (e), the business practices  which the OFT may 
consider to be deceitful or oppressive  or otherwise unfair or improper include 
practices in the carrying on of a consumer credit business that appear to the OFT to 
involve irresponsible  lending.  
     
In January 2008 the OFT produced general guidance on fitness and requirements. That 
documents reference was OFT969.  
This addressed the scrutiny the OFT was likely to carry out on businesses activities  and 
refers to one of the OFTs  main  regulatory interests  which  was to ensure that businesses 
lent responsibly. It says in paragraph  2.13:   Irresponsible  lending is now cited specifically in 
the fitness test as a business practice  that [it] may consider deceitful or oppressive or unfair 
or improper . The significance being that such a practice  may impinge on a business ability 
to successfully apply  for a consumer credit licence if the OFT found  evidence of such 
practices.
And para 2.14 of the OFT969 document contained  interim  guidance on the test for 
irresponsible lending  ahead  of a public consultation  on full guidance  on this test. It says: 
lenders should  always take reasonable care in making loansThey should undertake 
proper and appropriate checks on the potential borrowers creditworthiness and ability  to 
repay the loanThe checks should  be proportionate, taking account of the type of 
agreement, the amounts involved,  the nature of the lenders relationship with the consumer, 
and the degree  of risk to the consumer.
The OFT Guide to Irresponsible Lending (ILG) was published in March  2010 (updated in 
February 2011) and OFT969 was one of its foundations. 
In addition to taking into account the OFT969  document, the Lending Code 2006 (the 
Code) was published  by a trade body which I have used to give me further insight into the 
approach lenders were expected to take around that time. Whether or not Provident  was a 
member of that trade body in 2008  is somewhat irrelevant:  I am able to think about these 
publications as being an indication of market practice at the time. 
The Code does  cover  personal loans and it refers to some  key commitments.  Some  of these  
were to:
Ref: DRN08822193act fairly, reasonably  and responsibly  
help you when you need information  and guidance, including explaining how
the products  will affect  your finances
consider cases of financial difficulty sympathetically and positively.
In April 2014, the Financial Conduct  Authority introduced its Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
rules when it took over as regulator. This is referred to as CONC and reading  the earlier 
versions of CONC there are clear references  back to the specific ILG paragraphs. This 
demonstrates a continuity of the same  concept of lending responsibly. 
I have carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ns complaint.  I am not reviewing Loans 2 and 3. 
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Provident should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include: where a customers income  is particularly low; where the repayments  are 
particularly high; and/or  where the frequency of the loans and the length  of time over which  a 
customer has been given  loans need  to be looked  at: repeated  refinancing could signal that 
the borrowing  had become, or was becoming,  unsustainable.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Provident was required to establish  whether Mrs N could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the OFT ILG defined sustainable as being the ability  to repay without  undue  
difficulties. In particular  the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time, while  
meeting other reasonable commitments,  and without having to borrow to meet  
the repayments.  Later, CONC  built on those same concepts enshrined in the OFT ILG. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
Mrs Ns representative has explained  that she was ill for a long time and had a major 
operation in April 2016. Most of these years  she was in receipt of benefits  and he has said: 
Provident did not act as a responsible lender  and my reassigning [sic] for this are, when my 
mother was in arrears her collector  continued  to offer further loans (£40 pw to £80 pw 
repayments) which put her more and more to debt and unable  to break this continuous
cycle. 
Ref: DRN08822194Loan 4 was approved for Mrs N when she was still some  way off repaying Loan  3, and the 
Loan 4 weekly  repayments were due to increase from £3 to £14. Loan 4 was approved  when 
Providents agent knew that Mrs Ns reason for taking  Loan 3 was to pay off what she owed 
up to that point (June 2009). Mrs N had a poor repayment history when she applied for 
Loan 4 with Loan 3 still outstanding. So I do not think that this was the right decision to 
approve that loan for her. I uphold her complaint for Loan 4.
I have also looked  at the overall pattern of Providents lending  history with Mrs N, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Provident should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Provident should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ns case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 5 and I say this because:
from Loan 5 onwards  Mrs N was provided with a new loan often to refinance  the 
previous one and sometimes  more than one at once. So Provident  ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mrs N was having to borrow further  to cover the 
earlier loan and to carry on borrowing. I think it would  have been apparent  that her 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
by Loan 5 she had been  in debt to Provident  for several years. Plus, loan 5 was 
double the amount  approved for Loan  4 and the weekly repayments were twice  the 
previous repayments.  Mrs N continued to increase the size of her loans from here;
Mrs N wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Provident.  Loan 13 
was for £1,700  plus interest and was more than four times  the principal sum taken in 
May 2011  six and a half years earlier. Mrs N had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Provident  over an extended period;
earlier loans were  refinanced into later ones and Loans 9 and 10 were in arrears and 
yet additional  loans were given after those.  
I think that Mrs N lost out because Provident  continued to provide borrowing from Loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ns indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit use over an extended period.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs Ns ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept her in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  Loans 5 to 13 and Provident should  put things right.
putting things right
Provident should not have  given Mrs N loans 4 to 13.
If Provident has sold the outstanding debts, it should  buy these back if able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Provident  is not able to buy the debts back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
Provident should: 
Ref: DRN08822195A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mrs N towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything  already 
refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mrs N which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs N originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) remove  all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding  loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mrs N as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs N having  made  overpayments  then 
Provident should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint 
is settled. It should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal Provident  
may already have  written-off. If this results in a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to
Mrs N. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance then it should try to agree an 
affordable repayment  plan with Mrs N. Provident shouldnt pursue  outstanding balances 
made up of principal already written-off.
E) remove any adverse payment information  recorded on Mrs Ns credit file in relation to 
Loan 4. The overall pattern of Mrs Ns borrowing for Loans 5 to 13 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Provident should remove these  loans entirely from 
Mrs Ns credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident  to deduct tax from this interest.  It needs to give
Mrs N a certificate showing  how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ns complaint in part and direct that Provident Personal  
Credit Limited does as I have set out above.   Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  
Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or reject my decision before 26 April 2020.
