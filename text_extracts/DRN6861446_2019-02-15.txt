K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN) trading as QuickQuid (QQ)  and PoundstoPocket 
(P2P) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had 11 loans and ten top-ups with CEN. Ive included a table summarising some of the 
information CEN provided about the loans in an appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  this complaint  and recommended it be upheld in part. He thought  CEN 
had done enough  to check whether loans 1-2a (agreed in September and October  2017)  were 
affordable. But he didnt  think this was the case for loans 3-11 agreed in the period  
November 2017 to April 2018. And because he thought proportionate checks wouldve shown  
those loans to be unaffordable, he recommended the complaint about those loans be upheld.
CEN didnt agree with the adjudicator. It said, Based  on the processes and checks  in place at 
the time [Mr H] requested loans 3-11, we cannot agree that these loans  should not have  been 
funded. It also provided a document it has sent on a number of occasions  to this Service 
explaining the processes and checks in place at the time.
As there was no agreement, the complaint has been passed  to me to decide. Since  the 
adjudication theres been no ongoing dispute about loans 1-2a, so I wont be considering these 
loans in my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Hs case.  
In its original submission to this service,  CEN said:
 since 1st March  2015, CashEuroNet UK implemented [an] affordability review, which involved  
collecting and validating income and expense  details from customers, in line with the [Financial 
Conduct Authority]  FCA Handbook. As such,  we believe  [Mr H's] loans issued post 2015 were 
affordable. Please note that we have escalated the broader concern of loans issued  post 
February 2015 to your senior  leadership and are in active discussion in an effort  to reach a 
resolution.
CENs response to the adjudicator essentially summarised and repeated  this original submission. 
It didnt provide any new case-specific information, or directly engage with the case-specific  
points the adjudicator made about the loans CEN provided to Mr H.
This Service has responded  to CEN on this generic  argument  directly and through earlier final 
decisions. So I am not going to address this point here, though I have considered it alongside 
everything else in making my decision. 
I would remind CEN at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  guidance  in how 
complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly  (my emphasis) by businesses.  In particular  
DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling  should   
Ref: DRN68614462ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling, for example  by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman to the individuals in the respondent  who 
handled the complaint and using  it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns  in determinations  by the Ombudsman concerning complaints  
received by the respondent and using this in training and development  of the individuals 
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other  relevant regulators and the Financial 
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with complaints in the 
respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Hs complaint and what  both parties have  said about 
this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr H borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  the 
rules and guidance  set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer  Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC),  I would expect a lenders  affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would expect 
QuickQuid to be conversant with these  through previous  ombudsman decisions, particularly 
recent decisions, which set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater  the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit  in a sustainable  way. So, for example,  Id expect a 
lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks:
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers  income; or
-the longer  the lending  relationship.
With this in mind, Ive considered whether CEN  carried out proportionate  checks before  lending. 
If necessary, I may go on to consider  whether the pattern  and frequency of lending  alone ought 
to have caused CEN to stop lending to Mr H.
For all of the loans provided,  CEN recorded  Mr Hs net monthly income as £1,130.  CEN  also 
asked Mr H about his total monthly living expenses.  What Mr H said varied at times, but for most 
of the loans Im looking at his total expenditure was declared as £525  this included  other 
monthly credit commitments of £150.
Having reviewed everything  CEN provided, I dont think its checks  were proportionate for the 
loans Im looking at. Ive explained why below.
Ref: DRN68614463When Mr H applied  for loan 3, he was already  showing some signs of not being able to properly  
settle his loans without being able to borrow further. Loan 2 was taken out just two days  after 
loan 1 was repaid and was then topped-up two days after it started. There  was then only a 15 
day gap from when  loan 2 ended until loan 3 was approved. Loan 3 was topped-up  twice, which 
meant that Mr Hs largest monthly  repayment more  than doubled.
In my experience, this pattern can arise when a consumer is borrowing from more than one 
(usually short-term) lender at a time  and is unsustainably using  high-cost credit to repay  
high-cost credit. So in the circumstances, I think it was important for CEN  to ensure it obtained 
the details  of Mr Hs short-term credit  commitments  before deciding whether to lend.  
Mr H declared his credit commitments were £150 a month. CEN adjusted this figure  to £302 after 
carrying out a credit check. It hasnt shown us what it found  out from its credit checks.   I dont 
know what was included or excluded  from the £152 adjustment it made  to what  Mr H declared.  
As a result, I havent seen  enough to say CEN carried out proportionate  checks  when  Mr H 
applied for loan 3.
For loan 4, I think CEN shouldve  again  done more.  There was only a two day gap between loan 
3 ending  and 4 being  approved  again clearly  raising the possibility that Mr H wasnt sustainably 
settling his loans. Including the top-ups on the preceding loans, loan 4 was the seventh advance  
to Mr H in about three  months.
So by this time, I consider it wouldve been proportionate for CEN to carry out a full review of 
Mr Hs income and outgoings before deciding on approving further loans. And this ought to have 
included asking  Mr H to provide proof of income and expenditure. I say this as I think  its more 
likely than not that Mr H was in financial difficulty at this time  and so it wouldve been  
proportionate for CEN  to do more than it did for his previous loans. I dont  think it was reasonable 
for it to continue to rely on what  Mr H told it. And I dont think  only asking  questions about certain  
aspects of his expenditure wouldve  still been  enough for CEN to decide  whether  it was 
responsible to lend.
I think proportionate checks would  be the same as above for the rest of the period of lending. 
Having said this, there may have also come  a point where the pattern of lending alone would be 
enough for CEN to realise it wasnt  appropriate  to continue lending.
But I dont think its necessary to decide if or when the pattern of lending ought to have caused 
CEN to stop lending  to Mr H. Thats because I think  proportionate checks for loans 3 onwards 
wouldve shown CEN that the loans were not affordable and it ought to have stopped  lending at 
this point.
Our adjudicator already set out in detail  what proportionate checks  wouldve revealed  about 
Mr Hs other  debt, including specific details about his short-term debt.
For loan 3 he thought CEN wouldve seen that Mr H had over £400 of existing short-term 
commitments to pay in the following  month  and that Mr Hs disposable income  wasnt £529 (as 
CEN estimated) but around £196. This wouldnt be enough to sustainably make the highest 
payment of £187 (before the top-ups) and is less than the largest  payments after the top-ups.
Im aware loan 3 was a multi-period loan and was contractually repayable in two payments in 
December 2017 and January  2018. So it may be that CEN  expected Mr H to save from month  to 
month. But given how much short-term debt he had  and that he routinely  topped up his loans 
while they were running  I dont think it was reasonable for CEN to think Mr H was saving 
money.
Ref: DRN68614464Ive independently  reviewed the figures the adjudicator came to for loan 3 and have also found 
that properly  taking into account Mr Hs other short-term debt wouldve meant  loan 3 wasnt  
affordable. So Im upholding  the complaint about this loan.
For loan 4 and onwards,  Ive reviewed the bank  statements Mr H has provided.  I appreciate that 
this isnt necessarily  what CEN wouldve seen.  But I think  theyre  the most  reliable source  of 
evidence I have to build an accurate picture of Mr Hs income and expenditure at the time. And 
so I think its reasonable to take them into account.
For the period covering  loans 4-11, Ive seen the following:
Mr H was overdrawn  and regularly paying  fees to his bank
even  after being paid, Mr H was barely out of his overdraft and his account was often 
only in credit for the day he was paid
Mr H was repaying multiple other short-term lenders and appears to have  been using 
short-term debt to fund his regular expenditure  and debt repayments
at times,  Mr Hs expenditure actually  exceeded his income from employment
In short, I think a proportionate  review of Mr Hs financial circumstances wouldve made  it clear to 
CEN that he wasnt in a position  to repay the loans  he was asking for sustainably. So I dont  think  
it shouldve approved loans 4-11.
I also noted that Mr H was at times spending more than £2,000  a month on gambling.  It isnt 
necessary to take this into account to find that Mr Hs finances were under pressure and that he 
wasnt in a position to sustainably repay the loans. But I mention it because it does  shed light on 
why he was borrowing so frequently.
Additionally, I think CEN  shouldve realised  that many  of the later loans were not affordable, 
based on the information it actually had. From loan 5 and onwards many of the loans  (with 
perhaps the exception of loans 6-6a and loan 7) would not appear  to be affordable based on 
what CEN calculated Mr Hs disposable income to be.
Many of these loans were multi-period loans. So CEN  has worked out what  Mr Hs disposable 
income would be across two or three months   making an assumption he would save  money  
from month-to-month. As Ive already said above, I dont  think it was reasonable for CEN to 
accept that Mr H was saving money from month-to-month.  He was borrowing regularly, topping-
up most of his loans and had only very modest  and sometimes no  breaks  between the loans. 
Without being able to save  from month to month,  the final balloon payment means  the loans 
appear to be unaffordable  as the balloon payment  exceeds or is too close  to CENs  estimate  of 
Mr Hs disposable income. So theres  another reason to uphold Mr Hs complaint about many  of 
these loans, other than CENs failure to carry  out proportionate checks and its resulting 
irresponsible lending  decisions. I dont need to make any further loan-specific findings, 
however, given what Ive already said above.
As an addendum, I think its worth noting that loans  7-11 were approved  after Mr H made his 
initial complaint. CEN  agreed this service could consider these loans. In his complaint, Mr H said 
the loans  had trapped him into a debt spiral, with the loan repayments taking so much of his 
wages that he had to borrow further loans to cover  the following months  living costs. In essence, 
Mr H was making a statement that he wasnt repaying  the loans sustainably. 
Ref: DRN68614465I acknowledge CEN didnt  have to automatically  accept Mr Hs statement. But in the 
circumstances, its surprising that CEN was happy to approve these loans without any deviation  
from its usual  process.  As Ive mentioned,  CEN has insisted  that all of its post-March  2015 loans 
were always  lent responsibly. But where  a consumer has explicitly said they were not settling 
loans without  further borrowing, Id expect to see some kind of reaction from a responsible 
lender. That nothing different happened when Mr H applied for loans  7-11 undermines  CENs 
insistence that it cannot possibly  have lent irresponsibly since March  2015. But this doesnt 
ultimately affect my finding that CEN was wrong  to approve loans  3-11.
In summary, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint  about loans 3-11 as I think proportionate checks 
wouldve shown CEN that they were not affordable for him.
what CEN needs to do to put things right
CEN must:
refund the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans  3-11
add to the refund  interest at 8% simple per year, from when the interest and charges 
were paid (if they were) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse  information about the loans from Mr Hs credit history
CEN has said that there is an outstanding  balance  on loan 11. If this is still the case, CEN should 
restructure the loan to remove any interest  and charges  and treat any payments made as if they 
were payments towards the principal. If there  is still a balance, CEN can offset what it owes  Mr H 
against that balance.  But it can only do this if it still owns  the debt. If it doesnt still own the debt, 
CEN should either buy it back or otherwise  work  with the debt owner to cap Mr Hs liability at the 
principal sum of £350.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN  to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps  set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or reject 
my decision  before 15 March 2019.
