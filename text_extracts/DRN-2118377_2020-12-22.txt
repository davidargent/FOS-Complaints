The complaint
Mr B complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited for damage to a van that he returned when he ended the hire purchase 
agreement under which the van had been supplied to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new van was supplied to Mr B under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-
Benz Financial Services that he signed in August 2016;
he returned the van when he ended the agreement early and it was inspected by a 
third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Financial Services in August 2019;
the inspection report recorded that the van had been driven for 46,474 miles and 
identified 19 items of damage or issues and estimated the total repair cost to be 
£1,761.86  the report included photos of the damage;
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services charged that amount to Mr B  he paid it £307.60 
for the damage to the front mirror but he complained to it about the other charges;
he wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service and our 
investigator upheld his complaint in part  he recommended that Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services should: waive the refurbishment charges for dents to the nearside 
front door, the nearside sliding door, the nearside quarter panel, the offside front door 
and the rear tailgate, totalling £132.38; waive the charges for replacing the 
dashboard and air vent, costing £57.14; and waive the charges of £60 for the tread 
depth on the front left and back right tyres;
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services has accepted our investigators recommendations 
and has reduced the amount that its charged Mr B to £1,204.74 but Mr B has asked 
for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman  he says that he returned the 
van in a good condition and doesnt know how it was damaged (hes complained 
about some other issues with the van - but that complaint is being dealt with 
separately);
Mr B had agreed that he would:  maintain the vehicle in a condition which is 
consistent with the attached Vehicle Return Standards ; and: If you do not look 
after the vehicle properly, and we suffer loss as a result, you will have to compensate 
us; 
Mr B has accepted that the offside wing mirror was damaged when he returned the 
van and hes paid £307.60 to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services but he disputes the 
other damage and issues identified in the inspection report;
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services has accepted our investigators recommendations 
and has agreed to remove charges totalling £249.52 so Ive considered the other 
damage and issues identified in the report;
I consider that the photos show damage to the front bumper, the offside front wing, 
sliding door and rear quarter panel, and the rear bumper and that the damage is 
more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear under Mercedes-
Benz Financial Services vehicle return standards;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the damage was present when the van 
was returned by Mr B  and hed driven it for more than 46,000 miles in about three 
years  and Im not persuaded that its likely that the damage was caused after hed 
returned the van; 
I also consider it to be more likely than not the van was supplied with a spare wheel 
and tyre and that they were missing when the van was returned  so I find that its 
fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to charge Mr B for the cost 
of replacing them;
the van was overdue for an MOT test when it was returned and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the van had passed an MOT test  so I find that its fair and 
reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to charge him for the MOT test; 
and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those charges have 
been made incorrectly or that theyre excessive so I agree with our investigator that 
its fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to reduce the total 
amount that its charged Mr B to £1,204.74  but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to take any other action in response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that its fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to reduce the total 
amount charge that its charged Mr B for the damage to the van and the other issues with it 
to £1,204.74.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and I order Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited to reduce the total amount charge that its charged Mr B for the damage 
to the van and the other issues with it to £1,204.74.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2021.
