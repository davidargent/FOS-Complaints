The complaint
Mr J is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aquacard, approved him for a credit account 
which he feels was unaffordable for him at that time.
What happened
Mr J applied for a NewDay administered credit account in May 2021. Mr Js application was 
successful and NewDay issued Mr J with an Aqua credit card with a £900 credit limit. 
In September 2021, Mr J raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he felt that the 
credit account that NewDay had approved him for had been unaffordable for him at the time 
of the application, and that NewDay should have known this, had they undertaken checks 
into his financial position at that time. 
NewDay looked at Mr Js complaint. They felt that they had undertaken checks into Mr Js 
financial position at the point of application, and that there had been nothing resulting from 
these checks that had given them reasonable cause to consider that Mr J might not be able 
to afford the credit he had applied for at that time.
Mr J wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, and he was also unhappy that it hadnt been 
disclosed to him at any point during the application process that the particular brand of card 
for which he was applying was an Aqua card. So, he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also didnt feel that there had 
been anything resulting from the checks that NewDay undertook at the time of the credit 
application that should have given NewDay any cause to suspect that Mr J might not be able 
to afford the credit, and so they also didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr J remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. At the time of the credit application they took details 
from Mr J of his annual income to check that he could most likely afford any monthly 
repayments that might become due on the account, and they also obtained information from 
a credit reference agency to better understand Mr Js wider financial position. And NewDay 
contend that there was nothing resulting from these checks that should have made them 
think that the credit account with a £900 credit limit would be unaffordable for Mr J at that 
time.
Having reviewed the information provided by Mr J at the point of application its notable that 
Mr J advised NewDay he had an annual income of £22,000 and that his total amount of 
existing debt was £100. Mr J has denied that he provided this information to NewDay, but I 
find it difficult to rationalise how NewDay would have obtained this information  which had 
to be entered manually into an initially blank field of an online application form  had the 
information not been entered as such at the point of application by Mr J. As such, I feel that 
its more likely than not, on balance, that Mr J did declare his annual income as £22,000 and 
his total existing indebtedness as being £100 at the point of online application.
Furthermore, the information that NewDay obtained from the credit reference agency 
demonstrated that Mr J wasnt at that time in arrears in any of his existing credit 
commitments, and while Mr J had incurred significant adverse reporting previously on his 
credit file, the last instance of such significant adverse reporting was over three years before 
the point of application.
It must be recognised here that Aqua, administered by NewDay, specialise in providing 
credit to customers with less than perfect credit scores, and that this is a commercial 
decision which they are entitled to make. As such, while Mr Js credit score may have been 
relatively low at the time of the application, it doesnt follow from this that it was irresponsible 
for NewDay to have provided credit to him. Instead, NewDay were free to choose to provide 
credit to Mr J, so long as they could reasonably demonstrate that such credit was in all 
likelihood affordable for him.
I think that NewDay did demonstrate that here. Im satisfied that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to consider that the annual income of £22,000 that was supplied to them at the 
point application was large enough so that Mr J would most in all probability be able to afford 
any monthly repayments that might become due on the account, especially in consideration 
of the relatively low credit limit of £900 that the account was approved with.
And Im also satisfied that the checks that NewDay conducted into Mr Js wider financial 
position appeared to demonstrate that Mr Js wider financial situation at that time was 
reasonably stable and didnt provide any indications of immediate or potentially imminent 
financial difficulty such that it was unreasonable or irresponsible of NewDay to have provided 
the applied for credit account to Mr J.
Mr J has also expressed his dissatisfaction that he wasnt made aware that the brand of 
credit account he was applying for was an Aqua account. NewDay have confirmed that the 
application was made online. I find it unusual that no mention of the brand would be present 
on an online application, although I struggle to see what practical impact this would have had 
on Mr J, and I note that when Mr J received the Aqua card he would still have been able to 
close the account within the cooling off period if hed not wanted to use that particular brand. 
All of which means that I find it difficulty to conclude that NewDay have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or 
instructing NewDay to take any further action at this time.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr J was wanting here, but I trust that hell 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
