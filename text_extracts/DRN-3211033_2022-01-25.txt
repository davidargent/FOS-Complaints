One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that STFL should put things 
right for Mr G from loan 5. STFL disagreed and the unresolved complaint was passed to me 
to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
STFL was required to establish whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Mr Gs representative has forwarded to us a message from Mr G to say that he agrees with 
the adjudicators assessment. And so, I do not need to review loans 1 to 4 as it appears 
theyve been resolved. They remain relevant when looking at the lending relationship 
between the parties. 
By December 2016 when Mr G was coming back for loan 5, and another £800, then he had 
been indebted to STFL for seventeen months and had been taking loans back-to-back for 
all that time.  
This shows me that Mr G was needing to ask for credit regularly and that it was not likely the 
reason for his loan requests were to temporarily cover some cash flow gap. And I think that 
STFL ought to have appreciated that this pattern of sequential lending was unsustainable. 
Mr G had got into a pattern of asking for credit every three or four months and by July 2017 
he asked for two loans in a day which demonstrated an escalation.  
I think that Mr G lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Gs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.So, I am upholding the complaint about the loans 5 to 10 and STFL should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr G from loan 5 as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr G may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr G in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mr G would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL has sai that there is a £40 outstanding balance. STFL ought to do as follows: 
refund all interest and charges Mr G paid on the loans 5 to 10; and
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; and
the number of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 5 to 10 should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
STFL is entitled to set off any outstanding balance against the refund monies due to Mr G. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr G 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Gs complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
