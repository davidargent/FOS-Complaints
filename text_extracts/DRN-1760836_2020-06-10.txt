The complaint
Mr B says Provident Personal Credit Limited lent to him irresponsibly. He says the loans 
were taking up a large part of his income and he couldnt afford the repayments. He then 
needed new loans to repay the ones he had taken out. 
What happened
This complaint is about nine home credit loans Provident provided to Mr B between July 
2012 and August 2019. Below is a table that includes some of the information that Provident 
has provided about the lending.

8 09/08/2018 £300 52 10/08/2019
9 10/08/2019 £1,200 52 outstanding
As is shown in the table there were significant gaps in the lending. There was a break of 
over 3 years between loans 3 and 4 and a break of eight months between loans 5 and 6. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that Provident shouldnt have 
approved loan 9. Provident agreed with the adjudicator and made an offer of compensation 
in respect of this lending. 
Mr B didnt accept this offer. This is because he thought that Provident was also wrong to 
approve loan 3 as he was in financial difficulty at the time of this lending. He provided further 
evidence that he said demonstrated this. 
As no agreement was reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high cost lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Provident should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
in part and Ive explained why below.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 and 2 and loans 4 to 8. And 
Provident has agreed to pay compensation in respect of loan 9. Because of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont be making a decision about 
this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr B had with Provident. So 
they are something I will take into account when considering loan 3. And Ive said that 
Provident should put things right in respect of loan 9, as it has agreed to do, in my putting 
things right section. 
Why I think Providents checks were proportionate for loan 3
This was Mr Bs third loan in around nine months. He needed to repay £48 a week for 63 
weeks. Provident recorded Mr Bs income as being between £400 and £500 a week. It also 
looked at his outgoings. And it recorded that, on average, he had a disposable income of just 
over £150 a week. So the loan repayments wouldve seemed affordable to Provident. And 
Mr B didnt have any problems repaying loans 1 and 2. 
I can see that Mr B was having financial problems and he says that he mayve been 
unemployed at some points in the lending. And I appreciate this must have been a difficult 
time for Mr B. 
But I havent seen any information that shows its likely Provident was made aware of any 
serious financial problems Mr B mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it 
to investigate his circumstances further. And this was a relatively early stage in the lending relationship, and  given the information it 
had, I wouldnt have expected Provident to look any further into Mr Bs circumstances. So I 
think it was reasonable for Provident to rely on the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessment Provident did for this loan was 
proportionate. And I think its decision to lend for loan 3 was reasonable. So Im not 
upholding Mr Bs complaint about loan 3. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr B paid on loan 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
given the amount of time that Mr B had been taking loans in this chain of lending 
when he took loan 9 any information recorded about would be adverse. So all entries 
about loan 9 should be removed from Mr Bs credit file.
If Mr B still owes Provident any of the principal balance he borrowed on this loan Provident 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Provident 
should then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr B went to towards the 
principal. But importantly, Provident needs to make sure that Mr B doesnt repay more than 
the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr B hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed Provident can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation. If Mr B has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple* interest from the 
date of payment to the date of settlement
And if Provident no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt entitled to make any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr B.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident to take off tax from this interest. Provident must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Provident Personal Credit Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2020.
