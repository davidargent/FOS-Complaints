The complaint
Mrs G complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and their decision not to reverse 
several disputed transactions she made through her PayPal account.
What happened
Between March and May 2019, Mrs G purchased several items from an online retailer, who 
Ill refer to as K. Mrs G used PayPal to process these payments.
Unfortunately, Mrs G wasnt happy with the quality of several of the purchases she made. 
And she says other items werent received. So, she contacted PayPal and raised disputes 
under their Buyer Protection Policy.
PayPal explained several of the purchases had been made using the Friends and Family 
personal payment option, meaning they werent covered by the protection policy. And for the 
disputes that were eligible, Mrs G didnt provide evidence that shed returned the goods to K 
in the time frames PayPal set. So, these disputes were closed in favour of K. Mrs G raised a 
Section 75 claim for some of the purchases through her credit card provider, and a refund 
was received this way. But Mrs G was unhappy with the service PayPal provided, so she 
raised a complaint.
She complained about PayPals decision not to reserve the transactions. She explained she 
used PayPal to complete the purchases thinking shed be covered by the policy. She thought 
PayPals decision not to reverse the transactions allowed K to send her fake goods, and she 
didnt think this was reasonable. She was also unhappy that PayPal asked her to provide 
proof that she returned goods to K, when she hadnt received the goods in the first place. 
So, she wanted PayPal to reserve the transactions that hadnt been refunded by her card 
providers.
PayPal didnt agree. They explained most of the purchases were made as a personal 
purchase, using the Friends and Family option. And because of this, they didnt fall under 
the protection policy which they thought was made reasonable clear in the protection policy 
documentation. And they thought theyd acted fairly when closing the disputes they could 
consider as Mrs G didnt comply with the timelines they set. They recognised the unfortunate 
situation Mrs G found herself in but didnt think theyd done anything wrong. So, they didnt 
think they needed to do anything more. Mrs G remained unhappy with this response, so she 
referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. He thought most of the 
purchases Mrs G made were completed using the Friends and Family option, which wasnt 
covered under the protection policy. So, he didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong 
when not reversing those transactions. And for the transactions that were eligible for dispute, 
he thought PayPal had acted fairly. He explained Mrs G hadnt provided the required 
information for two of the transactions and for the third, a dispute hadnt been raised and 
now fell out of the policies timescales. Because of this, he didnt think it would be fair for him 
to say PayPal had done anything wrong. So, he didnt think they needed to anything more.
Mrs G didnt agree. She explained she hadnt received the items so didnt think it was fair to 
expect her to show proof of return. And she didnt think it was fair for K to have taken return 
of some of the items purchased using the Friends and Family option, and not return her 
money. She felt shed be left substantially out of pocket and thought PayPal had a 
responsibility to address this as they were allowing K to trade using their platform. As Mrs G 
didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mrs G. Ive no doubt Mrs G 
has been left unhappy with the products and service she received from K. I think its clear to 
see Mrs G had concerns about the authenticity of the goods she purchased and there have 
been disputes about whether some of the goods were sent to her. And I can appreciate she 
spent substantial amounts so I can understand why this would cause her worry and upset. 
But my decision is focused solely on the actions of PayPal as they were acting purely as a 
payment processer. PayPal are separate to K, and they arent responsible for the actions of 
K. Nor are they a regulator who can decide who can and cannot use their services. So, for 
me to say PayPal have done something wrong, Id need to see they failed to assess Mrs Gs 
disputes fairly in line with their Buyer Protection Policy. Or, that they failed to reverse a 
transaction to Mrs G which shouldve been. And in this situation, I cant say thats the case.
Mrs G has provided a large amount of information in relation to the purchases she made. 
And Ive considered this. But, most of this information relates to transactions she made via 
the Friends and Family payment option, which is classified as a personal transaction.
Ive seen PayPals Buyer Protection Policy which explains that there are a number of 
exceptions where a purchase wouldnt be eligible for reimbursement. One of these 
exceptions is stated as 10. Personal transactions. Because of this, I dont think any of the 
purchases Mrs G made through this method qualified for reimbursement under the 
protection policy. So, I cant say PayPal did anything wrong when not reimbursing Mrs G for 
those amounts. 
I understand this leaves Mrs G out of pocket, and I do understand how frustrating this must 
be. But as I explained above, PayPal arent responsible for the actions of K or the products 
they sell. So, it would be unfair for me to ask them to pay for any mistakes K made with the 
goods they sold.
But I can see there were other transactions that were purchased as a business transaction 
for goods provided by K. Of these, two were refunded by Mrs Gs credit card provider. So, I 
dont think she suffered a financial loss for these disputes. 
This leaves two transactions purchases as goods. The first purchase was for $900 on 9 April 
2019 and the second for $1000 on 17 May 2019. After looking at the second purchase, this 
was purchased from a separate retailer, who Ill refer to a V.Mrs G raised her disputed for the first transaction 11 June, and PayPal asked Mrs G to 
return the goods to the seller and provide them with proof of postage. They asked Mrs G to 
do this by 21 June. I can see they chased Mrs G twice for the information within this time. 
Ive also been provided with read reports that show Mrs G read these messages. As Mrs G 
didnt provide this information, PayPal closed the claim on 21 June, finding in favour of K. 
I understand Mrs G says she didnt receive the items to return. And I can understand why 
this wouldve caused an issue for her. But crucially, I cant see that Mrs G contacted PayPal 
to explain why she couldnt follow the directions theyd asked her to take. And I think if she 
had, PayPal may have been able to do more to help her, although I cant say that for sure.
But at the time PayPal closed the claim, I dont think they were aware of the difficulties Mrs 
G faced in returning items she hadnt received. So, they processed the claim as Id expect 
them to do. The Buyer Protection Policy explains that PayPal required Mrs G to co-operate 
with them reasonably while processing the dispute. And I cant say she did that. So, I cant 
say PayPal did anything wrong when closing the claim without the transaction being 
reversed.
Ive seen the dispute for the second transaction was raised on 13 July, where PayPal asked 
Mrs G to follow the same directions of returning goods to the seller. They gave Mrs G until 
23 July to provide the proof of delivery evidence. But again, I cant see that any evidence 
was provided, so PayPal proceeded to close the claim.
Having looked into this further, it seems this purchase was for some form of website design. 
So, Mrs G was paying for a service, rather than goods. But I can see the payment was listed 
as a payment for goods and PayPal have confirmed this wouldve been the payment type 
Mrs G selected. And because of this, a services dispute cant be raised.
As Mrs G purchased a service, rather than goods, I dont think Mrs G wouldve been able to 
return them. So, I cant say that PayPals directions were reasonable. But crucially, I dont 
think PayPal were able to know that it was in fact a service, rather than goods, that Mrs G 
had purchased. And I cant see that Mrs G made PayPal aware of this despite receiving 
emails asking for certain evidence to continue the dispute. So, I think PayPal acted fairly 
when closing the claim after no evidence had been provided.
And I dont think it would be fair for me to say PayPal have acted unreasonably when 
processing the purchase under a services dispute. I think it was Mrs Gs responsibility to 
choose the relevant payment type when paying V for the service they offered. And it seems 
as though in this case, she didnt. As the payment was listed as a goods payment, I think its 
reasonable for PayPal to say only a goods dispute can be raised. This was done and closed 
due to no evidence being provided. Because of this, I dont think its fair to say PayPal have 
done anything wrong as so, I dont think they need to do anything more.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mrs G was hoping for. And I want to re-assure her Ive 
taken all of the information shes provided into account, as well as the fact there are still 
several transactions she feels should be refunded. But I hope this decision goes some way 
to explaining why the majority of these do not fall under PayPals Buyer Protection Policy. 
And helps to explain exactly what PayPal are and are not responsible for in relation to both K 
and V. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl 
& Cie, SCA.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
