The complaint
Miss P complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc wont refund money she lost after she fell victim 
to a scam.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties and has been well detailed in 
our investigators view, so I wont repeat it in detail. But in summary and based on the 
submissions of both parties, I understand it to be as follows.
In February 2021, Miss P received a text message from who she thought was Royal Mail 
requesting a fee for a delivery. Miss P was expecting a package and thinking this was 
genuine followed the link and provided details for payment. She became suspicious when 
she saw the payment wasnt going to Royal Mail, so she contacted HSBC to report she 
thought this was a scam and that shed compromised her bank details. HSBC cancelled 
Miss Ps debit cards and issued her new ones.
Two days later Miss P received a call from somebody pretending to be from HSBC. The 
number Miss P was called from appeared to be the same as HSBCs telephone number 
(although it was different by one digit). The caller told Miss P somebody had tried to make a 
payment from her account and she needed to move all of her money to keep it safe. Miss P 
has said the caller sounded professional and knew all about the HSBC app. Unknown to her 
at the time, Miss P was speaking to a fraudster.
Believing everything to be genuine, Miss P went ahead and made a number of transfers 
from her HSBC account, two of these went to account details provided by the fraudsters, 
with the remainder being sent to an account Miss P held with another provider (from which 
she then moved the funds on again to accounts controlled by the fraudsters).  Miss Ps other 
provider wasnt able to recover any of the funds Miss P lost.
To facilitate the payments Miss P transferred the entire balance of her ISA account (which 
she also held with HSBC) to her current account. The fraudsters also persuaded Miss P to 
increase her overdraft and take out a loan, explaining to her that she needed to do this, as if 
she didnt somebody else could.
 
In total, Miss P sent payments from her HSBC totalling £45,855, a breakdown of these 
payments is below;
Transfers to account details provided by fraudsters;
19/2/2021 £7,495
20/2/2021 £6,195
Transfer to account Miss P held with another provider:
19/2/2021 £2,000
19/2/2021 £500
20/2/2021 £1,250
20/2/2021 £2,500
20/2/2021 £2,750
20/2/2021 £2,250
20/2/2021 £2,495
21/2/2021 £4,375
21/2/2021 £2,200
21/2/2021 £2,250
21/2/2021 £100
21/2/2021 £2,195
21/2/2021 £3,000
21/2/2021 £2,000
22/2/2021 £2,300
Miss P has explained the scammer talked her through making the payments step by step 
and coached her all the way through, telling her that it was urgent that she moved the 
money. Miss P has told us at the time she was taking medication which severely impacted 
her logical thinking. 
Miss P realised shed been scammed when she tried to call the fraudster, but where the 
telephone number was one digit out she couldnt get through. So she then contacted HSBC 
and the scam came to light. 
HSBC is a signatory of the Lending Standards Board Contingent Reimbursement Model 
(CRM Code) which requires firms to reimburse customers who have been the victims of APP 
scams like this in all but a limited number of circumstances. HSBC agreed to refund Miss P 
£13,690, being the funds she had transferred directly to accounts controlled by the 
fraudsters. But it didnt agree to refund the remainder of Miss Ps loss. In its final response to 
Miss P, dated 29 March 2021, it said the funds shed sent to her own account were still 
under her control when they left HSBC, as such these were not covered by the CRM code.  
It added that as the payments had gone to an account she held, it couldnt try and recover 
the funds. HSBC did offer Miss P £100 compensation, by way of an apology for not giving 
her further details about scams when shed contacted it regarding the Royal Mail text 
message shed received.
 
Unhappy with HSBCs response, Miss P brought her complaint to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into things and thought the complaint should be upheld in part. In 
summary he said that at the point Miss P was making a payment of £6,195 on 20 February 
2021 a pattern of fraud had started to emerge, and there was a compelling case that at this 
point HSBC ought to have intervened. It was our investigators view that had HSBC 
intervened at this point it would have made a difference and the scam would have been 
uncovered.
  
Our investigator went on to consider whether Miss P had acted reasonably in the 
circumstances and whether she too should carry some responsibility for her loss. But he 
didnt think she should, in summary he thought she had acted reasonably in making the 
payments and was mindful of the medication she was taking, which impacted her decision 
making. He recommended HSBC should refund Miss P the remainder of the money she lost, 
from the point shed made the payment of £6,195 on 20 February, and that it should pay 
account interest on the funds lost that originated from her ISA, with 8% interest for the loss 
funded by the loan. 
Our investigator issued his view of the complaint on 7 April 2022, giving both parties the 
opportunity to respond by 21 April 2022. Miss P responded and accepted the view. HSBC 
didnt respond. Our investigator contacted HSBC again on 9 May 2022, giving it until 16 May 2022 to provide its response. HSBC got back to our investigator on 9 May 2022, it 
apologised for the delay in responding and said it would try and respond by the deadline 
stipulated.
 
No response was received, so our investigator contacted HSBC again on 26 May 2022, 
giving it until 1 June 2022 to send its thoughts on his view. On 6 June 2022, where no 
response had been received, our investigator let both parties know that the complaint would 
be passed to an ombudsman for consideration. That had a deadline of 20 June 2022, but no 
response was received. Because HSBC hasnt responded to the Investigators view or any 
follow up correspondence, the complaint has been passed to me to consider and issue a 
final decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our statutory rules provide  at DISP 3.5.8 to 3.5.15 of the Financial Conduct Authority 
Handbook  that we may give case-management directions and fix or extend deadlines and 
that we may: 
reach a decision on the basis of what has been supplied and take account of the 
failure by a party to provide information requested;
 
And that: 
If a respondent fails to comply with a time limit, the Ombudsman may: (1) proceed 
with consideration of the complaint; and (2) include provision for any material distress 
or material inconvenience caused by that failure in any award which he decides to 
make.
 
Ive therefore concluded that, in the absence of a response from HSBC, it is fair and 
reasonable to proceed on the basis of the evidence we already have and to take account of 
its failure to reply to the Investigators opinion. 
Having considered everything carefully Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this 
complaint as our investigator. I do think its finely balanced as to whether HSBC should have 
intervened sooner. Where Miss P has made a payment on 19 February 2020 for £7,495, this 
was larger than any payment shed previously made within the months leading up to the 
scam. But Im mindful banks like HSBC have a difficult balance to strike in how they 
configure their systems to detect unusual activity or activity that might otherwise indicate a 
higher than usual risk of fraud. There is a delicate balance to be struck. There are many 
millions of payments made each day and it would not be possible or reasonable to expect a 
bank to check each one. Here, I can see although this payment was high compared to     
Miss Ps typical account activity, it didnt clear the account balance (which can sometimes be 
an indicator of fraud) and Miss P has made a number of transfers in excess of £1,000 in the 
months leading up to the scam.
  
But while, on balance, I think it was fair for HSBC to process the payments on 19 February 
2021, Im persuaded that a pattern of fraud was starting to emerge and given its obligations 
to protect customers from financial harm from fraud, I think there was enough going on, at 
the point Miss P was making a payment for £6,195 on 20 February 2021, that it ought to 
have concerns she may have been at risk of financial harm and I think it ought to have 
intervened. Im satisfied that had HSBC intervened it would have been able to identify that Miss P was at 
risk of financial harm from fraud. I say this as the circumstances had several hallmarks of 
this type of scam, including the payments to new payees, the unusual account activity and 
large payments being made from accounts in quick succession. HSBC also had the benefit 
of being aware, that just days before Miss P had contacted it to alert it that she was 
concerned shed compromised her bank details. 
For broadly the same reasons our investigator gave in his view, I am also satisfied there was 
no contributory negligence on Miss Ps part, I think she was simply the unwitting and 
blameless victim of a clever and manipulative fraudster.
Putting things right
HSBC should now;
- Refund Miss P the remaining money she lost, from the point on 20 February 2021 
where she made a payment for £6,195, being £29,665.
- Pay interest at the ISA account rate, for the payments where Miss P transferred 
funds from her ISA account to facilitate the payments out (to be paid from date of 
transaction to date of settlement). 
- Pay 8% interest on the payments Miss P made on 21 February 2021 for £2,000 and 
£3,000 (from date of transaction to date of settlement)
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
