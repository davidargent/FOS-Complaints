The complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) marked his credit file.
What happened
Mr D had a marbles credit card from NewDay. The statement dated 22 March 2020 had a 
balance of £2,774.80 and the limit was £2,800. The minimum payment of £107.21 was due 
to be paid by 16 April 2020. Mr Ds income was affected by the pandemic and NewDay 
agreed two payment holidays. The first one ran from 3 April 2020 to 20 July 2020; the 
second one ran from 24 July 2020 to 20 November 2020. Mr D didnt make any payments 
between April 2020 until 19 November 2020  when he paid the required amount of £135.18.
Mr D complained. He said he had two payment holidays (PH) and yet his credit file had been 
marked with missed payments. He said this was against the payment holiday (PH) scheme, 
and against what NewDay had told him in letters about them. As a result of what happened, 
his credit score had been affected, and he said he hadnt been able to rent a property. He 
had been made almost homeless. 
NewDay said they acted fairly. In their final response they said that Mr D hadnt made the 
contractual minimum payments and the information reported to the credit reference agencies 
was therefore correct.
Mr D brought his complaint to us. Our investigator upheld Mr Ds complaint  as NewDays 
letters set out that he didnt need to make any payments during the two payment holidays. 
And then, after theyd ended, Mr D had made the necessary payment on 19 November 2020 
 ahead of when the second PH ended on 20 November 2020. He said that Mr Ds credit file 
should be amended and compensation of £200 paid.
Mr D didnt agree with the compensation  he said it should be £25,000. NewDay didnt 
agree either. They said Mr D shouldve paid £107.21 by 20 July 2020  and he didnt. This 
was explained in the call between Mr D and NewDay on 3 April 2020. And the second PH 
didnt start until 24 July 2020. So  theyd said theyd applied the terms and conditions of the 
card agreement and notified the late payment markers to the credit reference agencies for 
the period of the PH. Both Mr D and NewDay asked that an ombudsman look at the 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ds complaint is about the payment holiday scheme. In April 2020, the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) announced guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including NewDay, had to put in place payment 
holidays on many credit agreements, including credit cards  to help customers who were 
affected. Customers could ask for a total of two payment holidays each of three months  
whereby payments could be suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit 
reference agencies, although interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support 
was provided by firms up to the end of October 2020. 
NewDay agreed to two PHs between 3 April 2020 and 20 July 2020; and then from 24 July 
2020 to 20 November 2020. In NewDays case, they went beyond what the FCA laid down  
as they didnt charge any interest during the PH.
The crux of Mr Ds complaint is whether the payment due by 16 April 2020 was due and 
shouldve been paid by then; and when it wasnt, whether it shouldve been paid by 20 July 
2020.
Payment of £107.21 due by 16 April 2020: Mr D spoke to NewDay on 3 April 2020 and set 
up a three-month PH. NewDay wrote to Mr D on 3 April 2020 and the letter said Until 20th 
July 2020 your monthly payments are £0. This means that you do not need to make any 
monthly payments until then. When your payment holiday ends, you will have to start to 
make at least your contractual minimum monthly payment again.
I think the letter here is clear  Mr D didnt have to make any payments for three months, 
including the payment due on 16 April 2020. I also listened to the call on 3 April 2020 and 
the call handler said, referring to the payment of £107.21 with the payment holiday we can 
stop that payment due date for three months. So the £107.21 we can move until 20 July 
2020. He went on to say that Mr Ds credit file will show all up to date.
And so  I think it was reasonable for Mr D to assume that he didnt need to make the 
payment in April 2020. And therefore, any missed payment markers applied by NewDay for 
the period of the first PH wasnt reasonable.
Payment of £107.21 to be paid by 20 July 2020: Mr D asked for another three-month 
payment holiday in July 2020. I havent seen NewDays contact notes but as NewDays letter 
to Mr D was dated 24 July 2020, I assume he called NewDay on that day. This was after the 
due date of 20 July 2020. To be fair to NewDay, on 10 July 2020  they wrote to Mr D to say 
that PH was coming to an end and From 20th July 2020.you will need to start making at 
least your minimum monthly payment again by the date shown on your next statement. Any 
payments that were already due before your payment holiday began will become 
immediately payable on 20th July 2020.
And on the call on 3 April 2020, NewDays call handler did say that £107.21 had to be paid 
by 20 July 2020  he advised it to be paid by 17 July 2020 to allow it to clear. And he said 
that if Mr D needed more help at that time, he should call NewDay then. 
The letter dated 24 July 2020 said Until 20th November 2020your monthly payments are 
£0. This means that you do not need to make any monthly payments until then. When your 
payment holiday ends, you will have to start to make at least your contractual minimum 
monthly payment again. Mr D argues that because he had a second PH, that meant he 
didnt have to make the payment on 20 July 2020. On the other hand, NewDay say that 
because he called after 20 July 2020, he had already missed the payment and so  the 
missed payment markers were fair. 
Ive considered both arguments here. And on balance, I thin Mr D was entitled to think he 
had a second PH which ran from the end of the first one. I say this because -  the letter dated 
24 July 2020 doesnt have start date in it  it only says, Thank you for getting in touch with us recently to discuss your account. So - Mr D couldve considered that it ran on from the 
first PH. And in any case, given that  there were only four days between the PHs  it 
wouldve been reasonable for NewDay to run the second PH on from the first PH. 
I also noted that Mr D wasnt sent a statement in June 2020  which wouldve shown the 
amount due and the July 2020 payment date. Instead he got a letter from NewDay which 
said As per our recent correspondence, you are currently receiving a holiday from your 
payments. As mentioned previously, you will not receive regular statements during this time. 
Mr D then went onto make the payment due by 20 November 2020  on 19 November 2020. 
So  he didnt miss the payment in that month either.
And so, I think it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of Mr Ds complaint that NewDay 
delete the missed payment markers from his credit file. Mr D has argued that the 
compensation should be £25,000. Our service had set out guidelines for amounts to be 
awarded. We say that an award of up to £300 is suitable where there have been repeated 
small errors, or a larger single mistake, requiring a reasonable effort to sort out. And having 
considered what Mr D has said to us  I agree with our investigator that a payment of £200 is 
the right amount for what happened. I accept that Mr D will be disappointed by this, but Im 
satisfied it is right. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd must:
Remove the missed payment markers from Mr Ds credit file between March 2020 
and November 2020.
Pay compensation of £200 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 September 2022.
