K820x#14complaint
Ms G complains about the credit broking service she received from WestWon Limited when 
she ordered a new car using  a finance  agreement. 
background
In May 2018  Ms G enquired about  leasing a car with WestWon.  She received  three  quotes  
for three cars and replied  stating her interest  in one of them. Ms G said the advisor went 
about sourcing  the car and advised  he had found one. She said she signed a proposal  form 
on 24 May 2018 
Ms G said she had to chase up WestWon several  times and received messages from the 
advisor that he had some  personal challenges going  on at the time. She said she had 
various text message conversations where  WestWon advised things were progressing.  On 
13 June she received a call and email informing  her that the car was awaiting registration 
and would be available at the latest  by 26 June. On 22 June WestWon messaged  Ms G to 
say the car was ready to transport and it assured Ms G that it was sorting out her 
personalised number plate. 
WestWons advisor said he would visit Ms G on 25 June to collect  a document  from her to 
take to the dealer himself  but he sent a text message that morning to say he wasnt  well. Ms 
G said texts and calls then went unanswered. She said on 27 June  she received a call from 
the advisor saying  he no longer wished to deal with her. Ms G complained to WestWon.  She 
said she was told the advisor was going through personal issues and had had a problem 
with the car order which he hadnt been  able to fix. Ms G said the manager was rude to her 
and offered no further advice or comments except  to pass her number to someone else who 
could find a car for her. She brought her complaint  to this service. In addition to the customer 
service Ms G complained  that her credit  file now had a negative  marker. 
WestWon disputed some elements of Ms Gs complaint  but accepted the customer service 
shed received wasnt what it shouldve been.  It initially offered £150  to Ms G which  our 
investigator thought  was fair and reasonable. Ms G did not accept this. She felt that £500  
was more appropriate for the seven weeks of inconvenience  and misleading  information she 
had been given. She also felt she had lost out on other car finance deals. 
Our investigator put this to WestWon  who raised  its offer to £200.  WestWon had told this 
service it had taken a business  decision  not to take on Ms G as a customer and she also 
hadnt met their criteria for credit. 
Ms G rejected this second offer. She said email  evidence had proved she had passed  
WestWons credit check and was ordering a car. She also said as she had signed 
documents with WestWon  she wouldnt  have considered going  anywhere else for finance.  
She asked  for a final decision  from an ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I find that £200 is a fair 
offer. Ill explain why. 
Ref: DRN25941532WestWon has accepted it did not provide Ms G with a good  level of customer service. It said 
it had a number  of opportunities to tell her it had made a mistake  with the vehicle lease 
quote but instead had decided to try to find a cheaper solution rather  than explain the 
problem. So its left for me to decide if £200 is a fair and reasonable remedy. 
There are no contact  notes between WestWon and Ms G nor are there any call recordings. 
Ive seen copies  of some emails and texts and from what I can see communication between  
WestWon and Ms G appears  to have been instructive  and cordial during May and to the 
middle of June. 
There was an initial delay  to Ms Gs application and WestWon confirmed this was because 
Ms G had been declined by the first finance  company it applied to on her behalf. But it wasnt 
in a position to tell Ms G why it was declined.  Ms G was accepted by the second as a 
prospective client and she then went on to sign a credit proposal so that WestWon could 
order the car. Ms G has complained that this is a financial binding agreement. WestWon said 
the proposal is not a contract to buy the vehicle and that a number of prospective customers 
would sign a proposal and not proceed with their offer. Ive no reason to dispute  that. 
There followed a series  of texts about the progress of the order. But I can see by 22 June 
the relationship  between  the advisor from WestWon and Ms G had started to break down as 
WestWon was unable  to fulfil the order. And it does  appear it led Ms G to believe her car 
would be delivered  around that time.  Ms G ordered the car and seven weeks  later didnt get 
it. 
Im persuaded that there was a failure  to communicate appropriately to Ms G. Mistakes  do 
happen occasionally and perhaps  had WestWon explained the mistake earlier things 
wouldve ended more  cordially. Ms G and WestWon have provided  conflicting accounts of 
the nature  of the communication but it is clear to me that Ms G was very unhappy with the 
service and WestWon made  a business decision not to take Ms G on as a customer. 
I understand Ms Gs frustration with this situation.  Shes been  delayed in leasing a car which 
she says has caused her additional cost.  Im not disputing that. But unfortunately she hasnt 
been able to provide evidence of how shes been  financially affected. I also believe  that 
although Ms G ordered the car there was no contract in place and Ms G was ultimately able 
to go to another provider. In addition WestWon  has the right to make a commercial  decision 
not to continue to do business  with a customer. So I dont  believe it would be fair of me to 
ask WestWon to compensate her for financial loss. As the investigator has explained it also 
isnt our role to punish a business.  
Ref: DRN25941533I am persuaded, however,  that Ms G did receive misleading information so I do think 
WestWon should  pay her some compensation. Ms G has asked for £500. WestWon  has 
offered £200 and I believe this is closer to what I would expect and I consider  it to be a fair 
and reasonable offer under the circumstances of this complaint. 
WestWon has said one of the reasons it decided not to pursue business with Ms G was 
because she hadnt met their criteria  for credit, which Ms G has disputed. WestWons role in 
this arrangement is as a credit broker. It is the case that Ms G was declined for finance  by 
one finance provider and had been accepted by another.  But this doesnt  necessarily mean  
she would  meet WestWons own criteria for credit. Its not my role to comment on how 
WestWon assesses a potential customers financial risk.
Ms G has also complained that this has left a poor mark  on her credit  file. Ms G intended to 
acquire a car through  a finance  agreement and by doing so would have risked being 
declined for credit irrespective of which credit broker she used. 
my final decision
My final decision is that WestWon Limited should  pay Ms G £200 as compensation for her 
inconvenience. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2019.
