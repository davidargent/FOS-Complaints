K821x#15complaint
Mr N says Provident Personal Credit Limited  lent to him irresponsibly. He says the loans 
caused him to spiral  into debt. This affected his financial situation  and his health. He says 
Provident didnt  assess his situation  properly  at the time of sale and it didnt look into his 
complaint properly. 
background

November 2009  and November 2011.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She didnt think  that Provident was wrong to 
approve loans  1 to 5. But she did think it was wrong  to approve loans 6 to 10
Provident agreed with the adjudicators recommendation and made an offer to settle the 
complaint in line with the adjudicators recommendation.  
Mr N didnt accept this offer. This was because he and his wife had both made complaints. 
He said they had taken a similar amount of loans but Provident had paid a larger amount of 
compensation to her  it had upheld all of Mrs Ns lending. So he thought that his earlier  
loans should also be upheld. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
Ref: DRN28164442These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Provident should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.  I agree that Mr Ns complaint should 
be upheld in part and Ive explained why below.
Provident has accepted our adjudicators  opinion about loans 6 to 10. Because  of this I dont  
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But, Ive included these loans in my putting  things  right section below for 
completeness.
should Provident have approved  loans 1 to 5?
Provident hasnt  been able to supply full information about the checks it did before approving 
loans 1 to 5. And Mr N has also been  unable to supply much  information about his 
circumstances at the time of sale. This is understandable given the time that has passed 
since these loans were  arranged. 
The information I do have  shows  that Provident  is likely to have looked at Mr Ns income and 
expenditure before lending. I think this would  be proportionate in respect of loans 1 to 3 
given that this was early  on in the lending relationship  and the amounts he was borrowing 
were relatively small and wouldve had a fairly  small weekly repayment commitment.  So I 
dont think that Provident was likely to be acting  incorrectly when it approved loans 1 to 3. 
Ref: DRN28164443In respect of loans 4 and 5 it is possible that Provident should have made more detailed  
checks into Mr Ns circumstances  before approving these loans. But as I said above,  Mr N 
hasnt been able to provide enough  information  to allow  me to say with any degree of 
certainty what Provident wouldve seen if it had made these further checks.  So Im not 
persuaded that Provident was acting  incorrectly  when it approved  loans 4 and 5. 
I havent seen  any further information  that shows its likely Provident was made  aware of any 
financial problems Mr N mightve  been  having. And so I also dont think its reasonable to 
uphold his complaint on this basis. 
So, overall, I think Providents decisions to lend for loans 1 to 5 were  likely to be reasonable 
and Im not upholding Mr Ns complaint about  them. 
What seems to have happened here is that Provident has made a commercial decision 
about Mrs Ns complaint to pay a certain amount of compensation.  It hasnt done this in 
Mr Ns case as our adjudicator had already reviewed it. 
Whilst this is unfortunate, and I can see why Mr N thinks it is unfair,  I must  look at each 
complaint individually. And so the fact that Provident  may have treated his wife differently 
isnt really relevant  to Mr Ns complaint. I must reach an outcome that is fair and make award 
based on my consideration of Mr Ns individual circumstances only. Which  Im satisfied  Ive 
done here. 
putting things right  what Provident  needs to do
Provident shouldnt  have given Mr N loans 6 to 10.
Provident should add together the total of the repayments made  by Mr N towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments  made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including  anything Provident  have already refunded.
A) Provident should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual  payments made by Mr N 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr N originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
B) Provident should pay Mr N the total of A plus B.
C). The overall pattern  of Mr Ns borrowing for loans 6 to 10 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so Provident  should remove these loans entirely from Mr Ns credit  
file. If Provident have sold any of the loans Provident should ask the debt purchaser to do 
the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident to deduct tax from this interest. Provident 
should give Mr N a certificate showing how much tax Provident has deducted,  if they ask for 
one.
Ref: DRN28164444my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ns complaint.
Provident Personal Credit Limited  should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 August 2020.
