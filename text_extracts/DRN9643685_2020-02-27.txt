K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) reduced the credit limit on his 
credit card following a missed payment. 
background
Mr S brought his complaint to us as he was unhappy  with the response hed received form 
NatWest to his complaint.  He was concerned about the impact the missed payment and the 
reduction of his credit limit would have on his credit  record.
In their Final  Response Letter (FRL) to Mr S dated 22 March 2019 NatWest  said they 
couldnt confirm  any bank error had been  made. They told Mr S the mobile  app showing him 
a zero balance was confirming correctly in line with their procedures  whereby the arrears 
amount was confirmed  as opposed  to future payments required. NatWest said a customer  
would need to wait until their statement was generated to confirm further payment 
requirements as this information is not confirmed until then. They also told Mr S they were  
able to reduce  the limit on the account  at any time in line with the terms and conditions  on 
the account. And they apologised for not being  able to reinstate the limit at that time due to 
not meeting requirements but they noted Mr S had a conversation  with them  that day 
regarding the next steps in discussing this further.
Our investigator didnt  think NatWest  had acted incorrectly. He could see from the 
statements the minimum payment of £66.34  wasnt paid on 16 March  2019 and this was 
reflected on the March  2019 statement which resulted in a late fee of £12. He said this fee 
was waived when  Mr S called NatWest  on 22 March  2019. He found  the terms and 
conditions showed  NatWest could make the decision to reduce  the credit  limit and our 
service cant recommend it should be increased. And whilst he understood missing  a 
payment can cause an adverse effect on Mr Ss credit rating and Mr Ss concerns about this, 
this service couldnt ask NatWest to amend the credit limit.
Mr S didnt agree. He said his online banking statement showed he had a zero balance on 
the account and this is why the payment was missed. He also told us the April payment was 
£81.83 but when he spoke with the bank  they said the minimum payment due was around 
£15. Mr S said that information proved  the bank can get it wrong and backs  up his point.
After asking the bank for further information the investigator issued a second  view in which 
he was of the same opinion. He said the higher amount of £81.83 was shown as due in 
April 2019 as the minimum payment of £66.34 was missed on 16 March  2019. So a late fee 
had been applied and the higher minimum payment amount  of £81.83  was due by 
13 April 2019. He said if the payment of £66.34 had been met then the April 2019 minimum 
payment wouldve been £15.49 and the reason Mr S paid that amount was because 
NatWest cleared the arrears and fee due as a goodwill gesture when he called them on 
22 March 2019.  Mr S remained unhappy and asked for an ombudsman  to review his case.  
He thought the bank  had admitted fault and hed provided evidence  backing up his claim.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the view 
that this isnt a complaint which I can fairly and reasonably uphold. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN96436852Firstly Im satisfied NatWest can, at any time, reduce the credit  limit on this account.  The 
terms permit this, so NatWest are entitled to take the step they did. The reasons  NatWest  
have given for doing so  after the missed payment a review felt Mr S may struggle to 
service  the card with the increased  limit  dont seem unreasonable  to me in these  
circumstances. I also think NatWest have  explained their reasons for doing this to Mr S.
No one disputes that the minimum payment due on 16 March 2019  wasnt  paid. Mr S made 
two payments to his account in February  2019, £144.78 on 1 February 2019 and £4000  on 
16 February 2019. I can see them on his statement dated 19 February  2019  alongside his 
six other transactions for that month.  But that statement also clearly shows  an outstanding 
balance and that the minimum payment  of £66.34  is required by the 16 March  2019.
Mr S says he wasnt aware anything had to be paid in March  2019 as his online banking 
showed a zero balance, so that missed payment is a result  of this incorrect  information. I 
think the FRL which NatWest sent Mr S along with the letter of 5 April 2019 clearly explains 
that the balance on his online banking  app shows arrears. Its not a substitute for the credit  
card statement.  Its Mr Ss responsibility  to manage this account  within  the terms and 
conditions and to make the minimum payment.  If Mr Ss mobile  banking  app was showing a 
zero balance I think he ought to have queried  that knowing the payments hed made on 
1 and 16 February 2019 were less than his outstanding balance including his spending for 
the period of that statement. So I dont think its reasonable to hold NatWest  responsible for 
the missed payment.
Ive considered very carefully the information Mr S sent to us on 22 April 2019.  Theres  
NatWests letter of 5 April 2019 - sent after his complaint was reactivated and further 
investigated  and the screenshot timed at 13.46 which, although  undated, Mr S says was 
from 13 April 2019. Mr S says this screenshot - showing a totally  different amount of £81.83 
to that which  was due and paid in April 2019  namely £15.49 - backs up his case  that the 
banks system may have  been showing he needed to pay £66 the month before but his 
online banking showed zero.
Whist the app may have  shown a zero balance  in March 2019,  for the reasons already given 
by NatWest, I dont think that meant Mr S had nothing  to pay. And I think he ought  
reasonably to have  been  aware of that from both his statements and his usage  of the card in 
February 2019. So, although  I anticipate  Mr S wont agree with me, overall,  I dont think  
NatWest have done anything wrong  here.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this compliant.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
