The complaint
Ms W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have placed a restriction 
on her account which prevents her from withdrawing her funds. 
What happened
PayPal wrote to Ms W and said, to comply with regulations, theyre required to collect and 
verify information about their customers. They explained they must do this before a 
customers account receives a total of £2,500 in payments. PayPal explained the total 
payments received into Ms Ws account had reached £1,800 so they encouraged Ms W to 
provide the requested identification documents now to avoid any disruption to her account. 
PayPal then wrote to Ms W again a few days later and said her account had now reached 
the £2,500 threshold so theyd now restricted her account preventing her from sending or 
withdrawing money from her account until she provides the information requested.  
Ms W complained and PayPal responded and explained theyd contacted Ms W to say they 
have to comply with regulatory obligations which requires them to confirm the identity of all 
customers who receive a total of £2,500 (or currency equivalent) into their PayPal account 
within a year of the customer receiving their first payment. They said, at that point, Ms W 
was approaching the £2,500 threshold so they informed Ms W she would still have full use of 
her account, however they did encourage her to provide the necessary documentation in 
advance of exceeding £2,500. PayPal said Ms W then exceeded the threshold without 
providing the identification documents, so they restricted her account. 
PayPal explained if Ms W is willing to provide the documents requested they would be 
prepared to release the funds.    
Our investigator looked into things for Ms W. He thought PayPal hadnt acted unfairly in 
withholding Ms Ws funds. Ms W disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Ms W will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
My starting point is the terms and conditions which a customer agrees to when using 
PayPals services. Ive looked at the PayPal User Agreement and under the heading Holds, 
it says, A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the 
transaction level or the account level. When PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the 
money is not available to either the sender or the recipientSome common situations where 
PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that: A user has not 
provided sufficient information to us to enable us to verify their identity The User 
Agreement goes further to say You will need to resolve any issues with your account before 
a limitation can be removed. Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information 
we request. 
The User Agreement also says PayPal can limit the amount of money you can receive 
until you complete the verification process for your account. PayPal have chosen to set that 
limit at £2,500 and I can see this was explained to Ms W at the point her payments had 
reached £1,800. I can see PayPal asked Ms W to provide the relevant documentation before 
reaching the threshold to avoid any disruption to her account. As this wasnt provided, and 
the payments received then reached the threshold, PayPal restricted Ms Ws account. 
So, taking this all into account I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly here. Theyve 
restricted Ms Ws account and withheld her funds in line with their User Agreement as the 
identification documents theyve requested havent been provided. I understand customers 
might find it inconvenient to provide identification documents after theyve already been 
using a service. But I dont find that PayPal did anything wrong in requesting identification 
documents. Its in all our interests that security checks are enforced to reduce the likelihood 
of businesses and their customers becoming victims of fraud. As an online payment service, 
and one where they wont generally deal with their customers face to face, PayPal are still 
required to ensure they maintain a safe and secure platform for customers. So, I dont think 
its unreasonable for PayPal to ask for identification to be able to verify or authenticate all 
information associated with a customers account.  
 
I note Ms W challenges PayPals statement about her receiving £2,500 into her account as 
some orders were refunded which had the effect of bringing her total payments received 
below the threshold. I do acknowledge this and can see Ms Ws payment activity shows 
payments received, payments made and also refunds. But, the policy set by PayPal relates 
to total payments received into the account rather than a balance based on payments 
received against refunds. Ive reviewed the payment activity and this shows total payments 
received into Ms Ws account did reach the £2,500 threshold. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
