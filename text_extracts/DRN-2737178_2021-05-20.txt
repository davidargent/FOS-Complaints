The complaint
Mrs S complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) has not fully compensated her 
and the estate of Mr S for the mis-sale of two payment protection insurance (PPI) policies.
What happened
Mr and Mrs S took out two joint loans with RBS. One loans account number ended 4469 the 
other ended 7153.
Mr and Mrs S were sold PPI policies with both loans.
Mrs S and the estate of Mr S complained to RBS about the sale of the policies.
RBS agreed to uphold the complaints and pay compensation. It offered to refund the PPI 
premiums plus any interest incurred because the PPI was added to the loans. It also offered 
to pay compensatory interest at 8% simple for the time Mrs S and the estate of Mr S had not 
had use of the money.
Mrs S says RBS has not paid the full amount of compensation for both policies.
An adjudicator from this service thought RBS had paid three cheques which represented the 
total amount RBS of compensation owed.
Mrs S disagreed with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold this complaint and I will explain why.
Where a PPI complaint is upheld on a joint loan, the compensation should normally be split 
50/50 between the two policyholders.
In this case both loans were held jointly.
Account ending 7153
For account number ending 7153 Ive seen a copy of a letter dated 28 November 2018 
addressed to Mrs S.
The letter states RBS has upheld the complaint and is prepared to offer Mrs S £720.54 . The 
letter states this represents her 50% share of the compensation owed.
The letter contained an acceptance form for Mrs S to sign. I can see Mrs S signed this form 
and dated it 6 December 2018.
RBS has shown us a screenshot of its internal systems showing that a cheque for £1,449.93 
was issued to her on 6 February 2019 and was cashed on 15 February 2019. 
Ive seen a letter addressed to Mrs S from RBS dated 6 February 2019 stating that a cheque 
was enclosed for £1,449.93 for account ending 7153.
I note that on 25 February 2021 Mrs S confirmed to our adjudicator that she had received 
this cheque.
It seems that RBS caused some confusion when it issued the offer letter dated 28 November 
2018. The letter stated it would only be paying Mrs S £720.54 or 50% of the compensation 
for loan ending 7153. But in fact the cheque for £1,449.93 represented the full amount of 
compensation for loan ending 7153. 
So I am satisfied that Mrs S and the estate of Mr S have received full compensation for the 
PPI sold with loan ending 7153.
Account ending 4469 
For account number ending 4469 Ive seen a copy of a letter sent to Mrs S dated 28 
November 2018 .
This letter offered Mrs S £580.57 as compensation for the mis-sale of the PPI with loan 
ending 4469. Again the letter stated that the £580.57 represented her 50% of the 
compensation due.
Ive seen a copy of the acceptance form that accompanied this letter. I can see it has been 
signed by Mrs S and dated 6 December 2019. 
Ive seen a copy of a cheque made out to Mrs S for £584.37 and dated 6 February 2019.
RBS has shown us a screenshot of its internal system which show a cheque was raised for 
the amount of £584.37 on 6 February 2019.
As part of her complaint Mrs S sent this service a copy of a letter from RBS dated                   
6 February 2019. This was a cover letter sent to her enclosing a cheque for £584.37.
RBS has told us this cheque was cashed on 13 February 2019.
I have also seen a letter from RBS dated 25 October 2019 addressed to Mr S. 
This letter referred to a complaint about PPI sold with loan ending 4469. It offered £598.49 
compensation and stated that this represented Mr Ss 50% of the compensation due for the 
mis-sale of the PPI with loan ending 4469.
I have also seen a letter addressed to Mrs S dated 28 February 2020. This is a covering 
letter. The letter states that a cheque for £605.40 is enclosed which represents Mr Ss 
settlement for the mis-sale of the PPI sold with loan ending 4469.
Mrs S has confirmed to this service that she received a cheque for £605.40 in February 
2020.
So, after looking at all the evidence I think Mrs S has received two cheques for loan ending 
4469, one for £584.37 in February 2019 and one for £605.40 in February 2020 which 
represent all of the compensation due for that loan.So in summary I am satisfied Mrs S has received the full compensation due for both loans. 
In my view some confusion was caused because Mrs S expected four cheques. But RBS 
combined the compensation for both Mr S and the estate of Mr S into one cheque for loan 
ending 7153.
I have noted that Mrs S recalls that she only began to complain to RBS about the PPI in 
February 2019. So she has questioned how the complaint could have been settled by RBS 
so quickly. However , Ive seen correspondence from earlier than February 2019 about the 
complaints. For instance the letter from RBS making an offer for loan ending 7153 is from 
November 2018. So I think Mrs S, or someone acting on her behalf, must have complained 
to RBS sometime in 2018.
My final decision
My final decision is that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc has fully compensated Mr S and the 
estate of Mr S for the mis-sale of PPI with loan accounts ending 7153 and 4469.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S and the 
estate of Mr S to accept or reject my decision before 17 June 2021.
