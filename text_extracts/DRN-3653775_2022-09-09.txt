The complaint
Mrs F complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved a Debenhams and 
Fluid credit card in her name.
 
What happened
Mrs F had previously held two Aqua credit cards with NewDay. The cards were closed 
following financial difficulties with Mrs F in 2014. 
In May 2018 Mrs F applied for a Fluid credit card. Mrs F said she was employed and that her 
income was £20,000 a month. Mrs F also said she was a homeowner. NewDay carried out a 
credit search and found £13,300 of unsecured credit and a default that was 33 months old. 
NewDay approved the Fluid credit card with a £600 limit. 
Around July 2018 NewDay sold Mrs Fs closed Aqua accounts to a third party business. 
In September 2018 Mrs F applied for a Debenhams credit card. Mrs Fs application said she 
was employed with an income of £21,000. NewDay carried out a credit search and found 
Mrs Fs unsecured balances had increased to £17,400 since her previous application and 
the defaults were now 38 months old. NewDay approved the Debenhams card with a £900 
credit limit. 
Last year Mrs F complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay issued a final 
response but didnt uphold Mrs Fs complaint. An investigator at this service looked at Mrs 
Fs complaint and upheld it. They thought NewDay had lent irresponsibly by approving the 
Fluid and Debenhams credit cards and asked it to refund all interest and charges. NewDay 
didnt accept so Mrs Fs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mrs F could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement;
- The existing relationship with the individual
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
NewDay asked Mrs F for details of her income and circumstances. A credit search was also 
carried out. But NewDay had an existing relationship with Mrs F and had previously offered 
two credit cards to her that had been closed following financial difficulties. Those credit cards 
were sold a couple of months after the Fluid application was completed. But its clear 
NewDay was aware that Mrs F had previously been unable to sustainably maintain 
repayments. 
I also think the credit file information shouldve caused NewDay to consider completing 
better checks. Mrs F owed around £13,300 against an income of £20,000. Whilst Mrs Fs 
payments were up to date, a reasonable proportion of her income wouldve been used to 
service existing debt. I think NewDay shouldve carried out more comprehensive checks 
before deciding whether to proceed. 
In much the same way, I havent found that proportionate checks were completed during the 
Debenhams application. NewDays credit search found Mrs Fs unsecured credit balance 
had gone from around £13,300 to £17,400 in a period of about five months. A sharp increase 
of this nature shouldve put NewDay on notice Mrs F mayve been having difficulties making 
ends meet. And NewDay had approved another credit card around five months earlier. 
Taken all the available information into account, Im satisfied NewDay shouldve completed 
better checks before deciding whether to lend. 
There were a range of options open to NewDay to complete further lending checks. Mrs F 
has sent us a copy of her bank statement from the period in question as well as a complete 
credit report. Had NewDay looked at Mrs Fs bank statements I think it wouldve found she 
was unable to reasonably sustain further repayments and declined the applications. In my 
view, NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved Mrs Fs credit card applications. 
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, Im not persuaded its fair for it 
to be able to apply any interest or charges due under the credit agreement. But I think Mrs F 
should pay back the amounts they have borrowed.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Fs complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle in line with the 
following: 
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mrs F along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Mrs Fs credit file. 
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with Mrs F for the remaining amount. Once Mrs F has 
cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be 
removed from their credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must 
give Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. If it 
intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting 
the tax.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
