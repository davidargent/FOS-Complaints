K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund to him the £30 that has 
been debited from his account  as a result of a chargeback claim.
background
Mr H received a payment,  through PayPal, of £30 in June 2017 from a third party  for an 
expansion vessel that hed sold to it. PayPal  received a chargeback claim from the buyers 
card issuer  in August 2017.  Mr H provided evidence to show that he had sent the item to the 
buyers correct address  and that its delivery  had been signed for in June 2017.  But the 
chargeback claim was upheld and PayPal debited the £30 from Mr Hs account. Mr H then 
found out that the reason for the chargeback claim had been given as: Cancelled  a 
recurring payment  but it still came out. Mr H said that he had never  previously dealt with the 
buyer so the reason code  was incorrect. He complained to PayPal which  said that it was 
obliged to accept  the decision of the card issuer.  Mr H wasnt satisfied with PayPals 
response so complained to this service.
The adjudicator recommended that this complaint should be upheld. He thought  that 
PayPals failure to fully explain  to Mr H the reason why the chargeback claim was being  
made meant that the correct reason  wasnt queried at the time. And he thought  that, had it 
been queried at the time, the matter couldve been clarified. He said that it appeared  that the 
transaction would  also have  been covered under PayPals seller agreement. He 
recommended that PayPal should  refund the £30 and the chargeback  fee of £14 and pay 
Mr H £50 for the inconvenience that hed been  caused.
PayPal has asked for this complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman.  It says that:
a decision made in a chargeback case, including the reason code used by the card 
issuer when filing a chargeback,  is beyond its control;
it cant reject the reason code filed by the card issuer and defended the case  by 
providing information about the delivery of the item as the reason code didnt  imply 
that it was a subscription payment; and
the transaction was eligible for PayPals  seller protection but the reason code it 
received was ineligible for coverage.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H has provided evidence  to show that he sent the expansion vessel to the buyer  and that 
the delivery of it was signed for. The buyer  made a chargeback claim which  was defended  
by PayPal on the basis that the item had been delivered.
But the reason  code  for the chargeback  was given by the card issuer  as being 4544  which  
PayPal says is cancellation of a recurring  billing agreement. Mr H says that hes never dealt 
with the buyer before  and that hes never had a recurring payment set up with the buyer.
So I consider that the chargeback claim was defended on the wrong basis  and that Mr H 
wasnt given the correct reason for the chargeback so wasnt  able to properly defend it. And, 
if Mr H had been given  the correct reason, I consider it to be more likely than not that hed 
have been able to provide evidence to show that he didnt have a recurring payment 
Ref: DRN33244972arrangement with the buyer and that this was a single purchase of an expansion vessel that 
had been delivered to the buyer. 
PayPal has debited the £30 that Mr H received from the buyer  from his account and it has 
charged him a £14 chargeback fee. I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances for PayPal to refund to Mr H the £30 payment and the £14 chargeback  fee.
These events have caused  distress and inconvenience for Mr H. I find that it would also be 
fair and reasonable for PayPal to pay £50 to Mr H to compensate him for that distress and 
inconvenience.
 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint. And I order  PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
1.Refund to Mr Hs the £30 thats  been debited from his account.
2.Refund to Mr H the chargeback fee of £14.
3.Pay £50 to Mr H to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 October  2019.
