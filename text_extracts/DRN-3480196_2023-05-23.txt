The complaint
Mr N complains that Canada Square Operations Limited wont refund to him the money that 
he paid for a holiday product. Hes being represented in his compliant by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr Ns then representative says that Mr N bought a holiday product in July 2005 for a total 
amount of US$14,326.01 and that he paid for part of the price using credit for which Canada 
Square Operations is now responsible. It provided credit card statements showing payments 
that Mr N had made of £468.76 in July 2005 and £213.08 in October 2005. His 
representative made claims to Canada Square Operations in September 2019 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday product was 
misrepresented to Mr N and that there were unfair negotiations.
Canada Square Operations said that Mr N had failed to provide it with any of the terms of the 
purported agreement and it had been unable to establish any connection between the 
payments and any agreement between Mr N and the supplier but it said that any claims 
would be time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr N wasnt satisfied with its response 
so a complaint was made to this service. Mr N representative then changed.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ns complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mr N bought the holiday product in July 2005 but didnt contact Canada Square Operations 
about it until September 2019 (more than six years later) to raise a claim, and she thought 
that he was outside of the time limits for making a claim under section 75 so she thought that 
it was fair for Canada Square Operations to turn down his claim. She said that Mr Ns 
representative complaint letter alleged that the sale was high pressured, and the sales 
representative acted recklessly but there was no additional detail to substantiate those 
allegations and nothing to suggest the existence of an unfair relationship so there was no 
substantive argument on section 140A for her to consider and she made no finding on such 
a claim.
Mr N representative, on Mr Ns behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that a full substantive response would follow upon receipt of instructions 
from Mr N but no such response has been received.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ns complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ns complaint is that Canada Square Operations turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that I consider that Mr N is likely to 
have signed to buy the holiday product in July 2005 or a full explanation of the credit 
that he used to pay for it  but I make this decision on the basis that he used credit of 
at least £100 for which Canada Square Operations is now responsible to pay part of 
the price of the holiday product;
Mr Ns claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Canada Square Operations response to those claims 
was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ns claim under section 75 is that the holiday product was misrepresented to him 
and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Canada Square Operations would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr N could have made a claim to the supplier or Canada Square 
Operations about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying the 
holiday product in July 2005 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made to him and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when he would also have used the credit to pay for part of the purchase price;
I consider that his cause of action accrued would have accrued at that time, so he 
would have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either 
the supplier or Canada Square Operations  but a claim wasnt made under section 
75 until September 2019, more than fourteen years later, which was outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Canada Square Operations 
has a defence to the claim and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to reject that 
claim;
Mr Ns representative says that there were also unfair negotiations between Mr N 
and the supplier so a claim was made under section 140A - section 140A gives a 
court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by 
the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
our investigator said that there was no additional detail to substantiate the allegations 
about the unfair negotiations and nothing to suggest the existence of an unfair 
relationship so she made no finding on a claim that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mr N and Canada Square Operations;Mr Ns representative says that Mr N had confirmed that he paid off his credit card in 
full before August 2010;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
even if a claim under section 140A had been fully and properly made to Canada 
Square Operations in Mr Ns representatives letter to it in September 2019, the claim 
would have been made more than six years after hed paid off his credit card in full 
so I consider that Canada Square Operations would have had a defence to any such 
claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected it; 
I consider that Canada Square Operations response to Mr Ns claims was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Canada Square 
Operations to refund to Mr N any of the money that he paid for the holiday product, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2023.
