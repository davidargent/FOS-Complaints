The complaint
Mr C complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for some holiday club membership points. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr C and his wife entered into an upgrade agreement in February 2015 to upgrade and 
enhance their existing timeshare and to receive 7,500 holiday club membership points. The 
total price payable under the agreement was £6,306 and Mr C paid £1,261 of that amount 
using his Barclaycard credit card in March 2015. He paid the balance of £5,045 from his 
bank account later that month.
Mr Cs representative made a claim to Barclaycard in March 2018 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
and the membership points had been misrepresented to Mr C and his wife. 
Barclaycard apologised for the poor way in which it had handled Mr Cs claim and the time 
that it had taken to respond to it and it credited his account with £25. It said that the payment 
of £1,261 was made to a third party payment processing service and its role was to ensure 
that the funds were taken from Mr Cs credit card and given to the holiday company so it 
didnt consider that the third party had breached its contract with Mr C or had 
misrepresented its services. It also said that it was unable to establish a link between them 
to suggest that the debtor-creditor-supplier agreement required for a claim under section 75 
hadnt been broken. Mr C wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the 
contract to Mr C and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Barclaycards decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she said that, 
because there wasnt enough evidence to uphold Mr Cs complaint, she hadnt made a 
finding on the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship.
Mr Cs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendation is manifestly wrong and none of 
the relevant clauses have been reviewed. It says that there have been breaches of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the Unfair 
Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair 
Trading Regulations 2008 and it has provided an indicative and non-exhaustive list of 
terms which it says may be regarded as unfair. It has also provided a generic submission 
from counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a further 
document in which it describes what it says has been a fundamental breach of contract by 
the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Cs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Cs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the membership points were misrepresented to him and his wife 
and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
Mr Cs claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Cs complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mr C and his wife, and his representatives letter 
to Barclaycard in March 2018 describes the misrepresentations that it says were 
made to Mr C and his wife, including that:
the holiday company insisted that the membership would give them access to 
cheaper holidays; and
they were informed that they would be members of an exclusive club and that 
they would receive priority when booking;
and it says that those promises were untrue;
Ive been provided with a copy of the upgrade agreement that Mr C and his wife 
signed in February 2015 and that agreement refers to the terms and conditions, the 
articles of association, a legal and governing documents booklet and a key 
information documents - I consider it to be likely that they would have also signed 
other documents as that time but neither Mr C nor his representative has provided 
signed copies of the documents referred to in the upgrade agreement or any other 
documents that they signed in February 2015;
Mr Cs representatives March 2018 letter to Barclaycard says that the holiday 
company insisted that the membership would give Mr C and his wife access to 
cheaper holidays but any member of the public can secure a holiday at one of the 
holiday companys resorts for less than they pay in yearly maintenance fees;
the letter says that Mr C and his wife were forced to endure an extremely high-
pressured presentation about the benefits of purchasing the membership points but 
no further evidence about the circumstances of the holiday companys insistence that 
the membership would give them access to cheaper holidays has been provided and 
I dont consider that Mr C has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company said that the membership would give them access to cheaper holidays;
Mr Cs representative says that Mr C and his were also informed that they would be 
members of an exclusive club and that they would receive priority when booking  
but theyve been unable to secure accommodation at the holiday companys resorts 
but the same accommodation is available to the public through third party booking 
agents;Ive seen no other evidence to show that they were informed that they would receive 
priority when booking or that the resorts were exclusive to club members and I dont 
consider that Mr C or his representative has provided enough evidence to show that 
Mr C and his wife havent received the points rights and membership on the terms 
and conditions to which they agreed in February 2015;
if the holiday company had made such promises to Mr C and his wife but the 
promises werent contained in the documents that they were then signing, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for the promises to be set 
out in writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr C and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the upgrade agreement by any such misrepresentations or 
that the membership points were mis-sold to them;
Mr Cs representatives March 2018 letter to Barclaycard says that the holiday 
company is in breach of the contract between it and Mr C and his wife and Mr Cs 
complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Mr C and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare 
Directive;
neither the March 2018 letter nor the complaint form provide further information about 
the alleged breaches of contract by the holiday company but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the upgrade agreement was misrepresented to 
Mr C and his wife or that theres been a breach of the EU Timeshare Directive;
Ive carefully considered what Mr Cs representative has said about the unfairness of 
the terms of the agreements that Mr C and his wife entered into with the holiday 
company and the breaches of regulations that it has described (including the various 
submissions that it has provided since our investigators recommendations);
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mr C and his wife are likely to 
have signed with the holiday company in February 2015 but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents was unfair;
Mr C and his wife signed the upgrade agreement and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence in these circumstances to show that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company for which Barclaycard would be liable under section 
75;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Mr Cs credit card statement shows that the payment of 
£1,261 was made to a trustee, and not to the holiday company (even though the 
holiday company is also referred to on the statement), its now possible that there 
was no such agreement in place following the High Courts judgment last year in the 
case of Steiner v National Westminster Bank plc;
but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or breach of contract 
for which Barclaycard could be liable under section 75, I consider that theres no 
need for me to make any finding as to whether or not there was a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement in these arrangements;
Barclaycard apologised for the poor way in which it had handled Mr Cs claim and the 
time that it had taken to respond to it and it credited his account with £25 - I consider 
that the £25 compensation that it credited to Mr Cs account was fair and reasonable 
compensation for those issues and that its response to his section 75 claim was fair 
and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr C and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday club membership points and the health issues that Mr Cs representative has 
described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require Barclaycard to refund to Mr C any of the money that he paid for the 
membership points, to pay him any further compensation or to take any other action 
in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2023.
