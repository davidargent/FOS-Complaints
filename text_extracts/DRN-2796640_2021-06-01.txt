The complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA is holding him responsible for an 
account balance that he doesnt owe.
What happened
Mr T disputed payments of £503.99 and £570 made using PayPal on 1 October 2019. He 
thought the money had been refunded. But PayPal told him he owed it £1,075.07.
PayPal said that it had refunded this money in October 2019. But that on 8 January 2020 it 
received indemnities from his bank for these payments and another from July 2019 for 
£1.08. It said it had to pay against these indemnities and debited the amount to Mr Ts 
account.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint be upheld, and that Mr T shouldnt be held 
liable for this amount. She asked PayPal a number of questions about the payments, but it 
didnt respond. That was despite her sending a copy of Mr Ts bank statements to PayPal 
that it had requested. These showed that in October 2019 the net position for Mr T was that 
the payments of £503.99 and £570 were refunded to him.  There were no related refund 
credits to his bank account paid in January 2020. So, she couldnt see how he owed this 
money to PayPal and it would need to contact his bank to resolve this. 
Mr T agreed with the resolution and PayPal didnt make any comments.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr T had linked his bank account to his PayPal account. So, when he made payments 
PayPal collected these from his bank using a direct debit. And if he was due a credit then it 
paid this back directly. As set out Mr T said someone had accessed his PayPal account 
without his authority and made payments on 1 October 2019 for £503.99 and £570 which 
were then collected from his bank account by PayPal on 3 October 2019. 
PayPal has never said that the payments he made were instead authorised. So, the issue is 
about how these payments were refunded to him. In its final response it says he has been 
trying to double dip - that is to attempt to recover money from both PayPal and the seller, 
bank or card issuer for the same transactions. PayPal says that the claims in January 2020 
related to refunds Mr T had already received. And this includes the small amount of £1.08 
which it says Mr T had received back from the merchant then involved and withdrawn from 
his account in July 2019. So, its position is that it was asked to send a total of £1,075.07 to      
Mr Ts bank. 
As our investigator has set out there is no evidence that Mr T has received this money from 
his bank. And PayPal hasnt dealt with questions she raised about this  after it had a copy 
of his statements. I have to deal with the complaint on the basis that it disagrees with the 
view of the investigator, but I dont have any further evidence about why that is. I agree that 
this is something that PayPal would need to follow up with Mr Ts bank not him personally to 
resolve any mistake.
Putting things right
PayPal hasnt persuaded me that Mr T owes it this £1,075.07 and so I find that he shouldnt 
be held responsible for this debt. I know it has frozen his account and it is a matter for 
PayPal to decide whether it wants to offer him an account or not. It should remove any 
adverse information about this debt that has been reported to third parties.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and I require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et  SCA to:
1) Not hold Mr T responsible for this amount of £1,075.07.
2) Arrange for any related adverse information reported to third parties about this debt 
and his account to be removed including at credit reference agencies. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2021.
