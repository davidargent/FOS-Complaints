The complaint
Mr I complains National Westminster Bank Plc didnt do enough to help him when he was 
having problems with his online banking.
What happened
Mr I has a current account with NatWest and relies on online banking extensively as he 
works abroad for long periods of time.
In September 2021 Mr I complained to NatWest that he was having problems sending an 
£80,000 payment  needed to buy a house  using his online banking. He was having 
problems because NatWest was saying that he needed a code to authenticate the 
transaction and this code was going to have to be sent by post to his UK address  he was 
abroad at the time. Mr I complained to us too.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Is complaint and spoke to NatWest too. Our 
investigator was able to resolve the problem Mr I was having sending the £80,000 payment. 
Having done so, however, Mr I said he continued to have problems with his online banking  
principally because NatWest said it was unable to send one-time passcodes to the foreign 
mobile number Mr I was using. Our investigator recommended £250 in compensation and 
said that NatWest needed to come up with an alternative that would work for Mr I. 
NatWest accepted our investigators recommendations, but Mr I did not. He said hed been 
having problems with his online banking for nine months and that a £250 fine was 
inadequate. He was also unhappy that despite having briefly returned to the UK and spent 
time going to a branch in an effort to fix the problem NatWest had made further mistakes. He 
asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint. So thats what Ive done.
Having looked into Mr Is complaint, I asked NatWest why it hadnt suggested Mr I use a 
card reader to authenticate himself when he was using his online banking, doing online 
shopping or doing something remote and risky. In other words, in the circumstances when 
NatWest needs to apply strong customer authentication measures. I suggested this as Id 
seen it work in other cases involving NatWest  including a case very similar to Mr Is 
complaint. NatWest agreed that this was an option that would work, and Mr I was happy to 
try it. NatWest said it couldnt send a card reader to Mr Is foreign address  even though Ive 
seen it do so in another case  but agreed to refund the costs Mr I incurred getting the card 
reader sent from his UK address to his foreign address. Mr I was fine with this. I also asked 
both parties about compensation but wasnt able to agree a figure. So, I issued a provisional 
decision saying that I was minded to award £1,000 in compensation  the amount NatWest 
agreed on the other case Ive mentioned. Mr I was fine with this. NatWest didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that the only issue that I still have to decide  assuming both parties are still 
happy that a card reader will solve the authentication issues Mr I was having  is how much 
compensation I should require NatWest to pay Mr I. Our investigator recommended £250 
which Mr I thought was an inadequate fine.
Ive explained to Mr I that when we award compensation, the compensation is based on the 
impact on the consumer of what went wrong and not based on what would or would not be 
an adequate fine. Thats because our awards are not meant to punish businesses. Ive also 
sent him the guidance published on our website on how we assess awards. Mr I said that he 
thought an award of £1,500 would be appropriate having considered the impact on him.
Putting things right
Having thought about the distress and inconvenience Mr I has been caused throughout this 
complaint  a significant amount of which would have been avoided had NatWest come up 
with a card reader as a solution earlier  including the number of times NatWest has 
proposed solutions that havent worked and the number of times NatWest has given 
incorrect information, I said in my provisional decision that I considered an award of £1,000 
was fair and reasonable. Neither side has disagreed. So, having considered everything 
again, and as neither side has had anything to add, thats the award Im going to make in 
addition to requiring NatWest to send Mr I a card reader and reimburse him the costs of 
getting that sent to his foreign address from his UK address assuming this hasnt already 
happened.
My final decision
My final decision is that I require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr I £1,000 in 
compensation. In addition, I require National Westminster Bank Plc to send Mr I a card 
reader and reimburse him the costs of getting that sent to his foreign address from his UK 
address assuming this hasnt already happened.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2023.
