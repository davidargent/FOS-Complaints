The complaint
Mr N complains about how Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) is reporting 
information about his loan repayments on his credit file. He says the reporting on the loan is 
inaccurate and has had a negative impact on credit profile. Mr N also says the situation has 
caused him stress. To resolve the complaint, hed like 118 118 Money to report accurate 
information about his loan status on his credit file.
  
What happened
The facts of this case arent in dispute, so I dont intend to set out a detailed background to 
the complaint. In summary 118118 Money acknowledges that it has reported incorrect 
information about Mr Ns payment history following his payment arrangement plan. It says it 
has taken steps to correct the error with the credit reference agency and offered Mr N £40 
for the inconvenience caused.
The complaint was looked at by one of our adjudicators who thought that 118 118 Money 
needed to do more and recommended that it pays Mr N £100 in compensation and correct 
the information reporting on his credit file. 118 118 Money disagreed and so the complaint 
has been passed to me to make a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is not in dispute that 118 118 Money acknowledges it has made an error with its reporting, 
and it seems that since that error in October 2018, it hasnt been able to correct the 
information reported on Mr Ns credit file as the account has been showing as being in 
arrears since that time.
Ive seen evidence that shows that Mr Ns account hasnt been in a payment arrangement 
since January 2019 and apart from a late payment in August 2019, which 118 118 Money 
has said it will report as OK, Mr N has kept to update with his repayments. As this is the 
case, Id have expected the information on his credit file to show that he wasnt arrears for 
those months, but it isnt.
118 118 Money says it has taken steps to correct the error by contacting the credit reference 
agency (CRA) but is unclear to me why the account is still reporting erroneously. To my 
mind, but for 118 118 Moneys error in the first place, Mr N wouldnt have been in this 
position and even though 118 118 Money has taken steps to right the wrong, the account is 
still reporting incorrectly. In my opinion, it isnt enough for 118 118 Money to say it submitted 
the information amendment to credit reference agency, I think it needed to ensure that the 
correct information was also now reported. 
As a result, Mr N says hes suffered stress, which I can understand and shows from the 
email correspondence he has had with 118 118 Money and the credit reference agency. The 
adverse incorrect information will also have had a negative impact on his credit outlook. So 
118 118 Money needs to put things right.
  
Putting things right
118 118 Money offered Mr N £40 in compensation when he initially complained but as the 
issue has persisted, I think it will be fair for it to compensation Mr N for the continuing stress 
and in the circumstances, I think £100 will be appropriate.
118 118 Money now also needs to take further steps to make sure the reporting on Mr Ns 
credit file is correct. Mr N isnt in continuing arrears as the screenshot from his credit file 
suggest and so 118 118 Money should remove the incorrect adverse information.
  
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ns complaint and requires Madison CF UK Limited to put things right as set out 
above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2021.
