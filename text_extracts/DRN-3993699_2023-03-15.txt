The complaint
Mr C complains that PayrNet Limited blocked his account and returned the money to the 
original source rather than to him.
What happened
In September 2021, PayrNet blocked Mr Cs account and held the money in it. They asked 
Mr C for some documentation relating to Mr Cs identity, and the source of funds. PayrNet 
say they received the identification from Mr C but not the evidence of source of funds. Mr C 
provided evidence to our service relating to the source of funds and says these had already 
been sent to PayrNet  so he wanted the money returned to him directly.
Mr C received emails from PayrNet in September 2021, and October 2021 asking for bank 
details to return the money to and informing Mr C it would be released to him. When Mr C 
didnt receive the money, he continuously chased PayrNet and confirmed not having access 
to the money was causing distress  especially as he suffers from anxiety and depression.
PayrNet say they returned the money left in the account to the original sources around 
December 2021 and closed the account in April 2022. 
Our investigator reviewed things and thought PayrNet shouldnt have returned the money to 
the original senders and that it should be returned to Mr C directly. She therefore asked 
them to return £2,312.95 plus 8% statutory interest to Mr C. And pay Mr C £100 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr C accepted our investigators recommendation. PayrNet also responded and confirmed 
they agreed.
In January 2022, Mr C got back in touch with our service as he still hadnt received the 
settlement from PayrNet. PayrNet confirmed they had returned the money to source in 
November 2022 and paid £345.36 to recognise the £100 compensation and the 8% statutory 
interest. Our investigator queried this as her recommendation stated that the money should 
be returned to Mr C  and not to source. She asked for the 8% to be revised to recognise the 
timeframe and asked for an extra £50 compensation to be paid. PayrNet confirmed they 
agreed with the settlement and compensation but as theyd already returned the money to 
source, they couldnt also refund Mr C directly. PayrNet agreed to pay an extra £50 
compensation in the circumstances.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
PayrNet has said they no longer hold the funds and have acted in accordance with the 
regulations by returning the funds to source. The problem is, PayrNet initially said the money 
was returned in December 2021, and in subsequent correspondence has said it was 
returned in November 2022. Either way, I havent received any substantial evidence to show 
that the money actually has been returned to source, or how PayrNet made the decision that 
Mr C wasnt entitled to it.
DISP 3.5.2 states, amongst other things, that an Ombudsman can reach a decision on the 
basis of what has been supplied and take account of the failure by a complainant or a firm to 
provide information that an Ombudsman has requested; .
Ive considered the fact that PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in 
order to meet its legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of new and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict 
customers accounts  either in full or partially while they carry out the review. 
While PayrNet are usually entitled to carry out a review, wed expect them to do so in a 
timely manner and without undue delays. When financial institutions carry out reviews, its 
common practice across the banking industry that the review will require additional 
information from the account holder. Often, the information required is related to the 
consumers identity, proof of entitlement to recent payments or more details on what the 
account is used for. Based on the evidence Ive seen, and alongside Mr Cs testimony, 
PayrNet did ask Mr C for some information. PayrNet confirmed they received Mr Cs identity 
documents but didnt receive the source of funds information. Mr C has provided our service 
with evidence to show why he is entitled to the money which was left in his account and says 
he sent this to PayrNet when they requested it. I appreciate PayrNet say they didnt receive 
it  but I havent seen any evidence thats the case. And based on the evidence I have 
received from Mr C, I think its more likely than not, Mr C provided this to PayrNet in 
September 2021 when they initially asked for it. 
PayrNet made the decision to return four payments back to the original sources  albeit one 
of the sources was Mr Cs account with another bank which had closed so the payment 
couldnt be accepted. Ive had to consider whether it was fair to return the money to source. 
Ive carefully considered the evidence both Mr C and PayrNet has provided. Based on this, 
and the full circumstances of the complaint, Im not satisfied PayrNets actions were fair. 
Ultimately, PayrNet would have to be satisfied that Mr C wasnt entitled to the money himself 
to justify returning it back to the original senders. Having considered the evidence Mr C has 
provided to our service, Im not persuaded PayrNet have made a fair decision.
I also think PayrNet confused matters by asking Mr C for relevant bank details to return the 
money to and informing Mr C he would receive the money within 10 working days in October 
2021. Of course, if relevant evidence was missing  as PayrNet say it was, I wouldnt expect 
this message to be relayed to Mr C  and I would expect them to chase Mr C for the missing 
evidence before making the decision to return to the money to source.
Overall, I dont find any plausible explanation as to how PayrNet satisfied themselves that 
Mr C wasnt entitled to the money and it therefore follows that I think they should refund Mr C 
the full balance of the money which was returned to source. I also dont think its reasonable 
that Mr C has been without his money for a long period of time. So, like our investigator, I 
think 8% simple interest should be paid on this amount.
Putting things right
Overall, based on the evidence received, I dont think PayrNet did enough to satisfy 
themselves that Mr C wasnt entitled to the money in the account  and I think Mr C has 
provided enough evidence to show he is entitled to it. So, I think PayrNet should refund Mr C as he is now at a loss. And I think adding interest to the amount they refund him fairly 
compensates Mr C for the loss of use of his money.
I also consider £150 compensation to be appropriate in the circumstances to recognise the 
distress this situation has continued to cause Mr C.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the following:
Refund Mr C £2,312.95 which they say has been returned to source.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the above amount. PayrNet should 
calculate this from 23 September 2021 up to the date they refund Mr C.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr C a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Mr M asks for one.
Pay Mr C £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Mr C needs to provide an up to date statement (dated in the last three months) to allow 
PayrNet to make the settlement. PayrNet must pay the compensation within 28 days of the 
date Mr C provides the up to date statement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2023.
