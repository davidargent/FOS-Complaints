The complaint
Mrs B, trading as M, complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont refund her for an 
item she returned to a seller.
What happened
Mrs B is a sole trader. In late 2020, she ordered an item for her business but was unable to 
get it fitted until April 2021 because of lockdown. She says she then discovered the item was 
poorly made and not worth what shed paid for it. She contacted the overseas seller, but they 
didnt respond. 
Mrs B reported to PayPal that the item was not as described. PayPal instructed her to return 
the item to the seller within ten days in order to receive a full refund. It said she needed to 
upload the tracking information. Mrs B provided a tracking number, but PayPal says it was 
unable to locate the shipment.
Mrs B complained that PayPal wouldnt issue her refund, but it didnt agree it had acted 
unfairly. Our investigator looked into her concerns but didnt think her complaint should be 
upheld. She was satisfied PayPal had acted fairly and in line with its user agreement 
because it couldnt verify that the item had been successfully delivered to the seller.
Mrs B asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. So, her complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Bs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection scheme in certain circumstances, including where the item is Significantly Not as 
Described. It goes on to explain the dispute resolution process, which includes the wording: 
Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a Significantly 
Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to 
the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide 
proof of delivery.
Proof of Delivery is defined as:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction 
Details page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
I can see Mrs B arranged for the item to be collected and provided the tracking number 
within the timescale specified by PayPal. 
PayPal has provided a screenshot to show that the shipment couldnt be located by the 
tracking number. But Mrs B has provided a screenshot from the couriers website showing 
that the item was collected on 19 April 2021. Unfortunately, theres no further information to 
show what happened after that date and the shipping address for the seller doesnt appear 
on the information Mrs B has provided. I also havent seen any other evidence that the item 
was successfully delivered to the seller. I appreciate this feels unfair for Mrs B who has 
shown that the item was collected. But I cant say that PayPal should have issued her with a 
refund when it hasnt seen the proof of delivery it required.
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mrs B. But Im satisfied that PayPal has acted 
fairly and in line with its user agreement. So, I dont require it to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
