The complaint
Mr W complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) shouldnt have opened a credit card account 
for him because it was unaffordable.
What happened
In 2012 NewDay opened a credit card account for Mr W with an unknown credit limit.
In 2013 NewDay increased Mr Ws credit limit to Â£1,250.
In 2016 Mr W closed his credit card account with nothing owing to NewDay.
In December 2022 Mr W complained to NewDay that it shouldnt have opened a 
credit card account for him because it was unaffordable.
In February 2022 Mr W complained to our service that NewDay shouldnt have 
opened a credit card account for him because it was unaffordable.
Mr Ws complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it 
shouldnt be upheld.
Mr W didnt agree with the investigators view, so his complaint has been passed to me for 
review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or contradictory I have to base my 
decision on the balance of probabilities.
NewDay will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. 
So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about 
our approach to these complaints is set out on our website.
NewDay hasnt been able to provide much in support of its decision to open Mr W a credit 
card account in 2012, or in support of its decision to increase his credit limit in 2013, 
although it has explained what its general underwriting processes were in 2012 and 2013. 
But this lack of evidence or information isnt surprising given the passage of time and 
NewDays obligations under General Data Protection Regulation. 
But equally Mr A hasnt provided any documentary evidence in support of his submission 
that NewDay shouldnt have opened him a credit card account either.
I accept that Mr W might have fallen into financial difficulties after his credit card account had 
been opened and his credit limit increased. But this isnt enough for me to be able to 
conclude that his complaint should be upheld.
So, although I cant discount what Mr W has told our service, Im not persuaded that there is 
sufficient evidence for me to conclude that NewDay did anything wrong in opening a credit 
card account for Mr W in 2012 or in increasing his credit limit in 2013.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2023.
