The complaint
Mr R complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has refused to refund him for the cost of 
an item he bought that was faulty.
What happened
Mr R says he bought a television from a company I will call A for about Â£1,800 in 
December 2020. He says the item was faulty and raised a dispute with PayPal. Mr R says 
he was asked to provide tracking information about the return of the item which he did but 
PayPal refused to refund him his money.
PayPal says it asked Mr R for the delivery information in line with its user agreement. It says 
he didnt provide it by the date given in February 2021 and so it rejected his claim. PayPal 
says Mr R later provided different tracking information but some months after the required 
date.
Mr R brought his complaint to us and said he may have made a mistake with the original 
tracking information but doesnt recall exactly what took place. Our investigator didnt uphold 
the complaint and thought PayPal told Mr R when it needed the tracking information and he 
didnt provide it by that date.
Mr R doesnt accept that view and says he did provide evidence of the return in April 2021. 
He says he didnt want to pay for the delivery initially and may have provided the incorrect 
tracking number.
What Ive decided  and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
I have looked carefully at PayPals user agreement which I think Mr R would have agreed to 
when the account was opened. That agreement says that to be eligible for its protection 
scheme it requires evidence of a valid return by a certain date. I can see that Mr R provided 
details of a return, but PayPal was unable to confirm it was valid. And I can also see that Mr 
R accepts that the return information was incorrect. In those circumstances I dont think 
PayPal made a mistake or acted unfairly by rejecting Mr Rs claim as he didnt provide 
evidence of the return by the required date in February 2021.
I appreciate Mr R says he provided correct tracking information to PayPal in April 2021. But 
Im satisfied that it was too late at that point and that PayPal had clearly told Mr R it needed 
the information by early February 2021. I have also listened to the call between our 
investigator and Mr R about the return issue and why incorrect details were initially provided. 
I dont think its clear what Mr R says about that or why incorrect details were given.
Overall, Im satisfied that PayPal acted in line with its user agreement and was reasonably 
entitled to reject Mr Rs claim as he didnt provide required tracking information by a given 
date. For that reason, I cant order PayPal refund the cost of the television.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2021.
