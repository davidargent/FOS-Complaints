Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint about loans 6 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN20758782the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  In the most  recent  opinion  of this case,  
our adjudicator felt loans  1  5 shouldnt  be upheld, and Mr R seems to have accepted  this 
view. So, as these  loans are no longer in dispute,  I havent considered  these further in my 
decision. But I have  looked at all of Mr Rs loans when thinking  about his lending  history with 
Sunny.
Sunny said it carried out income and expenditure checks and inquired about Mr Rs other
short-term credit obligations before lending him any of these loans. However, at the time
Mr R was applying for loan 6, further  checks of Mr Rs financial situation wouldve been  
proportionate. And I think at this point Sunny had enough information at hand  which  
indicated Mr R was not managing his finances  well. I say this because  at the time of applying  
for loan 6 Mr R had three loans outstanding. I accept  that by allowing customers  to take out 
more than one loan at a time provides flexibility in the way customers can borrow, but at the 
time of applying for loan 6 Mr R already had £450  outstanding  and was requesting  a further  
£300  all in the space  of four months.  And the £300 requested was the most Mr R had 
requested so far. This shouldve indicated to Sunny that Mr R was getting  further  and further 
into debt with it, and it was likely he wouldnt be able to repay this loan,  or any subsequent 
loans, sustainably. So, Im uphold Mr Rs complaint  about loans 6 and 7 on this basis.    
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
Ref: DRN20758783At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out seven loans within four months, and during this time 
there were only ten days where  Mr R had not been in debt to Sunny. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £150 and loan 8 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 8 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan before paying off previous 
loans.
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  11 was 
taken out six months after Mr Rs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr R had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Mr R borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications on 
his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 11 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 6 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 6 and 7 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  8, 9, 10 and 11 should be removed 
from Mr Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN20758784Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
