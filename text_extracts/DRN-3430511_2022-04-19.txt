The complaint
Mr and Mrs Ps complaint is that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt return the 
deeds to their home when they paid off their mortgage. Mr and Mrs P believe NatWest was 
sent the deeds when they took out their mortgage and it likely later destroyed them, without 
their permission or knowledge. 
Mr and Mrs P want NatWest to confirm when and where the deeds were destroyed and who 
authorised it to be done, in order to prove that the deeds were actually destroyed. If the 
deeds were destroyed, they want a reasonable financial offer of compensation, which they 
dont think the £250 that has been offered is. 
What happened
In 2004 Mr and Mrs P re-mortgaged their home with NatWest. They paid the mortgage off in 
2021 and expected NatWest to return the paper deeds for the property to them. This didnt 
happen and they contacted NatWest, the Land Registry, a specialist property data company 
and their solicitors at various points in their search for the deeds and attempts to have them 
replaced.
As Mr and Mrs Ps mortgage was taken out in 2004, NatWest said it wouldnt have needed 
the original paper deeds because the property would have had to be registered electronically 
with the Land Registry. As such, NatWest believed that, if it had been given the deeds, its 
solicitors would have returned them to Mr and Mrs P via their solicitors in 2004. 
NatWest responded to the complaint Mr and Mrs P subsequently made. NatWest confirmed 
that at the time Mr and Mrs P took out their mortgage, its solicitors would have returned any 
documents it didnt need to them or their solicitors. Any other documentation would have 
been placed in NatWests storage facility. However, its records had been searched and, 
while it identified that it had stored several sets of documents under the same surname as 
Mr and Mrs Ps, all of those documents had been destroyed. It also confirmed the deeds 
werent stored in its safe custody facilities. NatWest apologised for any mistake that might 
have happened. It offered them £50 for the administration charges Mr and Mrs P would be 
charged by Land Registry to obtain a copy of all the documentation it held. In addition, they 
were offered £200 for the inconvenience the matter had caused them.
Mr and Mrs P werent satisfied with NatWests response and referred their complaint to this 
service. 
One of our investigators considered the complaint, but she didnt recommend that it be 
upheld. She said that while she appreciated the sentimental value of the deeds, the lack of 
them had no financial effect on Mr and Mrs Ps ownership of the property or ability to sell it. 
As such, she couldnt conclude that Mr and Mrs P had suffered a financial loss because the 
paper deeds were no longer available. In relation to the compensation offered by NatWest 
for any upset it might have caused them, she considered it was reasonable in the 
circumstances.
Mr and Mrs P didnt accept the investigators conclusions. They said they had suffered a 
financial loss as they had spent many hours looking for evidence to help NatWest in its 
search for the deeds, along with the time and money they had spent dealing with the Land 
Registry. They said that they found the whole process with NatWest very unprofessional as it 
couldnt even confirm where the deeds had been stored or when they had been destroyed. 
Mr and Mrs P said that an apology was not enough if NatWest couldnt substantiate these 
facts. Mr and Mrs P questioned whether the deeds might still exist, and that NatWest should 
be doing more. If NatWest was still unable to find the deeds, they believe that it should be 
made to pay for its incompetence. 
Mr and Mrs P subsequently provided evidence of the costs they had incurred in trying to 
obtain a copy of their deeds through a specialist property data company. This information 
was sent to NatWest and it agreed to reimburse these costs. Our investigator didnt change 
her conclusions about the merits of the complaint in light of Mr and Mrs Ps further 
comments. Mr and Mrs P asked that the complaint be referred to an ombudsman for 
consideration.
Subsequently, Mr and Mrs P were asked for a copy of the correspondence they had referred 
to, in which the Land Registry had told them it had sent the deeds to NatWest. This email, 
from April 2021, explained that after initial registration of the property, the original deeds 
would have been returned to the party who had arranged the registration. It explained that 
this would usually be the purchasers solicitor or licenced conveyancer. It also confirmed that 
Mr and Mrs P had no need of the deeds, as the property was electronically registered with it, 
and when a mortgage was repaid, the lender would ask it to remove the details of the 
mortgage from the electronic title. 
Mr and Mrs P also provided a letter, dated 30 September 2004, from the solicitors that 
completed the legal work for the re-mortgage on behalf of NatWest. This contained the 
statement I will register the security documents [my emphasis] with the Land Registry and 
they will then be sent to National Westminster Home Loans Limited until the mortgage is 
discharged.
NatWest also confirmed that Mr and Mrs Ps mortgage was not arranged to purchase the 
property. Rather they already owned it and were re-mortgaging to NatWest from another 
lender. 
Contained within a property title are dates, one of which is affixed to the property register. 
This date records when the property was first registered with the Land Registry. In the case 
of Mr and Mrs Ps property title, that date is 26 June 2002. 
On 25 February 2022 I issued a provisional decision setting out my conclusions and reasons 
for reaching them. Below is an excerpt.
When a property is bought for the first time, it now needs to be registered with the Land 
Registry. Whilst this has been a requirement for a long time, it was not until 1990 that it has 
been strictly enforced and it is hasnt been possible since then to transfer the ownership of a 
property without it being on the registry. As such. it is possible that older properties might not 
have been registered when they were originally built. This means that historically a lender 
would take possession of the property deeds when they granted a mortgage. However, 
taking possession of the property deeds is no longer necessary and more recently still the 
registry has been converted to an electronic format allowing that all actions after the first 
registration can be completed without the need for paper documentation. 
As the Land Registry explained to Mr and Mrs P, when a property is first registered, it is 
usually done by the solicitors acting for the purchaser. When a first registration is done, the purchasers solicitor will provide the paper deeds to the Land Registry. As the Land Registry 
confirmed to Mr and Mrs P, the paper deeds would then be returned to the registering 
solicitors. 
In the case of Mr and Mrs Ps property, it appears from the dates on the title, that the initial 
registration was completed in 2002; more than two years before the re-mortgage with 
NatWest happened. As such, wherever the Land Registry returned the deeds to in 2002, it 
wouldnt have been to NatWest, as it was not involved at that point. So it would seem likely 
that the paper deeds would have, immediately before Mr and Mrs P re-mortgaged to 
NatWest, either been held by their existing lender, the solicitors that completed the 
registration in 2002, or themselves. 
NatWest told Mr and Mrs P that when the re-mortgage was granted, there was no need for 
the paper deeds in the process. That is correct, as the legal charge would have been added 
to the title electronically in 2004. So if NatWest was given the paper deeds in 2004, it is 
correct that it wouldnt have needed them and they should have been returned to whoever 
sent them to it. This is what NatWest has said would have been done.
I have thought carefully about the letter from NatWests solicitors in September 2004. This 
refers to the security documents being registered with the Land Registry and then returned 
to NatWest. The security documents in this situation would be the mortgage deed, which 
allowed NatWest to place a legal charge on Mr and Mrs Ps property. It is unlikely that the 
solicitors would refer to the property deeds Mr and Mrs P are seeking in this way. 
In light of the above, it seems unlikely that NatWest ever held the paper deeds for 
Mr and Mrs Ps property. 
NatWests responses have said that it doesnt believe that it would have had the paper 
deeds in 2004, or if its solicitors were given them, they would have been returned. However, 
it has some records of having held deeds for customers with the same surname as 
Mr and Mrs P. It seems that NatWests records relating to these storage arrangements are 
limited and it isnt able to categorically state that none of these records related to 
Mr and Mrs P. As such, it has apologised in case it did hold the deeds and subsequently 
destroyed them. It has offered Mr and Mrs P £200 for any upset and inconvenience an error 
on its part, if such an error occurred, may have caused them. In the circumstances, where it 
is not clear that an error occurred at all, I can only conclude this is a reasonable offer.
NatWest has also offered to pay the costs Mr and Mrs P have incurred during their search 
for their deeds. Again, given it is not clear that NatWest made a mistake, I think it was very 
reasonable for it to have offered to pay these costs.
Mr and Mrs P have said that they dont think NatWest has done enough to try to find their 
paper deeds. NatWest has confirmed that it completed searches of the storage facilities 
where it might have stored Mr and Mrs Ps deeds, if it had them. While Mr and Mrs P arent 
satisfied with these searches because they havent resulted in the outcome they want, I cant 
in the circumstances ask NatWest to do anything more.
Overall, as NatWest explained to Mr and Mrs P, I think it unlikely that it would have had the 
paper deeds for their home in storage. However, in the event that it did, and it destroyed 
them, I consider the offers NatWest has made Mr and Mrs P are fair. If they wish to accept 
those offers, they should contact NatWest directly.
NatWest confirmed it had received my provisional decision and that it had nothing further to 
add.Mr and Mrs P didnt accept my provisional decision. They said that they had proof that their 
previous lender had sent the deeds for their property to NatWests solicitors in 2004 and that 
they hadnt received them back. They also clarified that they hadnt contacted any solicitors 
involved in the transactions and did not confirm during our investigation that the solicitors 
didnt have the deeds. 
In addition, Mr and Mrs P said that they needed the deeds because details of a right of 
access to a private road were contained in them that any purchasers of the property would 
want that proof. So having the deeds was more than a sentimental matter. Furthermore, they 
said that they found my comments about being satisfied that NatWest had searched the 
places it would store deeds as unsubstantiated, unfair and insulting. They said that 
NatWest should be held responsible for identifying what it did with their documents. 
Mr and Mrs P also repeated their opinion of the letter they received from NatWests solicitors 
about the security documents meaning that the deeds had been placed in storage. 
Mr and Mrs P were asked to provide the proof they mentioned about the original deeds 
being sent by their previous lender to NatWests solicitors. They were unable to provide 
anything from the lender as they said theyd been told that it had in a telephone conversation 
and had been unable to obtain confirmation in writing. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would firstly repeat what I said about the registration of the property on with the Land 
Registry. This would have been done by solicitors on Mr and Mrs Ps behalf and it appears 
that it was done in 2002 at the latest. At this point the deeds would have been provided to 
the Land Registry and any important information contained within them regarding things like 
covenants or access rights, should have been recorded on the electronic register. So while 
Mr and Mrs P are under the impression the paper deeds contain important information that 
the electronic register doesnt, that shouldnt be the case. If Mr and Mrs P believe that this is 
the case, they might want to approach the solicitors that completed the registration on their 
behalf. Thats where the Land Registry has said it returned the deeds to after the electronic 
registration. 
I have read what Mr and Mrs P have said and I am sorry of they feel that my conclusion that 
I couldnt ask NatWest to do more, having had it confirmed that it has searched for the deeds 
in all the places it stores such documents, was unfair and insulting. I didnt intend for those 
comments to be insulting to Mr and Mrs P and I am sorry they took them that way. However, 
I remain satisfied that NatWest wouldnt have needed the paper deeds to complete the 
re-mortgage in 2004 as the property was already in the electronic register. So it is unlikely 
that it would have had the deeds, and if it did, that they would have been retained by it. 
Mr and Mrs P have said their previous lender had the paper deeds in 2004 and sent them to 
NatWests solicitors. While I dont doubt Mr and Mrs Ps understanding of what they were 
told, for the existing lender to be involved with the new mortgage would be very unusual. 
NatWests solicitors wouldnt usually have any contact with the previous lender. Mr and Mrs 
Ps solicitors would have been the ones to liaise with the previous lender, not NatWest or its 
solicitors. So if the previous lender had the paper deeds in 2004, it would most likely have 
sent them to Mr and Mrs Ps solicitors and if they were sent to NatWest, they would have 
been sent by Mr and Mrs Ps solicitors.  
I would apologise if I misunderstood Mr and Mrs Ps comments about having checked with 
their solicitors regarding the whereabouts of the paper deeds. They may want to do so, given that it is unlikely that NatWest had the paper deeds for Mr and Mrs Ps property or retained 
them if they did. 
That said, as I observed in my provisional decision, if NatWest was mistakenly provided with 
the paper deeds and had them in one of its deed storage facilities, I am satisfied that the 
deeds no longer exist. In the circumstances, if NatWest destroyed the deeds, I consider the 
offers it has made are appropriate in the circumstances. I know that Mr and Mrs P will 
remain dissatisfied with this, but NatWest cant produce something that no longer exists. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr and Mrs P to accept or reject my decision 
before 17 May 2022.
