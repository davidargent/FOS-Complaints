The complaint
 Mr C complains about two loans provided to him by Madison CF UK Limited, (118 118 
Money) which he says were unaffordable. 
What happened
 118 118 Money provided Mr C with 2 loans. The details of these are given below:

I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 16 November 2021. Both parties have 
received a copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from 
the decision below. I said;
Were 118 118 Moneys checks reasonable and proportionate for the 2 loans?
Mr C took out his first loan with 118 118 Money in July 2017. 118 118 Money says that it 
carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr C prior to providing him with this 
loan. It says it also carried out a credit check and ran a search with an online income 
verification tool. This check also gave a broad affordability assessment. Mr C declared that 
he was earning around £2200 a month and 118 118 Money says it used an online 
verification tool to verify this. I can then see from a document submitted by 118 118 Money 
that Mr C declared his rent payment to be £150 along with other expenditure totalling £500. 
Mr C declared his credit commitments to be £60 as part of this. I havent seen anything 
further as to what assessment 118 118 Money carried out here or how it used the 
information that it gathered.  
Ive carefully considered what 118 118 Money has said. But when I consider what I have 
already mentioned about the lack of detail it has provided regarding how it assessed the 
information it gathered and also the amount of the loan Mr C had asked for and the length of 
the term, I think that 118 118 Money needed to take steps to verify Mr Cs monthly 
expenditure. I think in particular it should have taken more steps to assess Mr Cs credit 
commitments and find out more about them. It would have seen Mr C had declared his credit 
commitments to be £60 and it would have seen that Mr C had 4 loans and a credit card with 
monthly repayments that would have amounted to more than that. So, I dont think it should 
have relied just on what Mr C had said regarding this to check that he could sustainably 
repay the loan repayments over the 24-month loan term. I think it should have carried out 
further checks with regards to loan 1.
Mr C took out his second loan in March 2020. Again, 118 118 Money asked Mr C for details 
of his income. I can see that it has recorded down an income figure of £2113. But I have not 
seen anywhere in 118 118 Moneys documentation that it asked Mr C for details of his 
expenditure. Again, I consider there is a lack of detail here about the information it gathered 
and also in how it might have assessed this. When I consider the limited amount of 
information it had gathered on Mr Cs expenditure along with the fact this was now his 
second loan application with it and he was looking to lend for another 12 months, I think it 
ought to have considered further checks here. I think the checks it carried out were not 
proportionate for loan 2 either.
I dont currently think that the checks 118 118 Money carried out before providing Mr C with 
his two loans were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to 118 118 Money that Mr C 
would have been unable to repay the two loans?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before loans 1 and 2 were 
provided, I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So, I need to decide whether it is 
more likely than not that proportionate checks would have told 118 118 Money that Mr C 
would have been unable to sustainably repay the two loans.
118 118 Money was required to establish whether Mr C could make his loan repayments 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments 
were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation when it agreed to lend 
to him on both occasions.
Mr C has provided our service with bank statements from the period of time before each loan 
was granted. Ive carefully considered the information provided within these statements. 
I have first of all looked through Mr Cs bank statements leading up to when he was granted 
loan 1 in July 2017. I can see that Mr C was paid close to what he had declared within a 
month of his requesting the loan. But when I look through his expenditure transactions, I can 
see that he took out 4 short term loans only days before he requested loan 1 with 118 118 
Money. He took these loans out on 12/06/17, 13/06/17, 29/06/17 and 30/06/2017. The last 
two short term loans being only a week before he approached 118 118 Money for this one. It 
is clear from seeing this and looking at his account in general, that Mr C was at that time in a 
spiral of debt and he was applying for short term credit to repay other credit. He was 
struggling to manage his finances. If 118 118 Money had carried out proportionate checks, I 
think it is more likely than not it would have uncovered this, and then not lent to Mr C. So, I 
currently uphold Mr Cs complaint about loan 1.
Moving on, I have then looked through the bank statements that Mr C has provided that 
cover dates leading up to 118 118 Money granting loan 2. Mr Cs finances appear to have 
improved at this stage and there is no sign of any short-term loan repayments on his 
statements from the month before he took loan 2 out. His living costs and essential financial 
commitments come to around £460 and his account looks fairly well managed. But Mr C has 
told our service that from February 2020 he was temporarily out of work. Mr Cs statements 
support what he is saying here. I cannot find any entry for the income he declared. I 
acknowledge what our investigator has said about Mr C declaring an income figure to 118 
118 Money. But I have concluded that it didnt carry out proportionate checks and if it had 
done more, I think on balance it would have seen that Mr C did not have a regular income 
amount on his statement and I dont think, on seeing this, that it would have agreed to the 
loan.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would 
more likely than not have shown 118 118 Money that Mr C would not have been able to 
sustainably repay either loan 1 or loan 2. So, Im satisfied that 118 118 Moneys failure to 
carry out proportionate checks resulted in it unfairly providing these loans to Mr C.So, it follows that I currently think that 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. Mr Cs representatives responded on 17 November 2021 and 
said they had no further points to add. 118 118 Money responded on 15 December 2021 
and said it agreed with my provisional decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
  Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have not made any new points for me to respond to. So, as neither party has 
anything further to add that I feel I need to comment on or that will change the outcome of 
this complaint, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings within my provisional 
decision. With that being the case, I uphold Mr Cs complaint.  
Putting things right
  I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr C to repay the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because he has had the benefit of that lending. But as I have concluded 118 118 Money 
shouldnt have provided the loans, so it should look to remove the interest and fees from the 
principal amount. 
118 118 Money should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges on loans 1-2 and treat all the payments Mr C 
has made as payments towards the capital for each of these loans.
If reworking Mr Cs loan accounts results in him having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to loans 1-
2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money should give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as I have described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2022.
