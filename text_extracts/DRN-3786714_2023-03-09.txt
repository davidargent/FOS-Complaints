The complaint
Mrs D, the wife of the late Mr D and the representative of his estate, complains that 
Honeycomb Finance Limited wont refund the money that Mr D paid for a timeshare trial 
membership agreement under a fixed sum loan agreement.
What happened
Mr and Mrs D entered into a timeshare trial membership agreement in March 2019. The 
price of the membership was £4,395 and Mr D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement that 
he electronically signed in March 2019 for a loan of £4,395 from Honeycomb Finance. He 
agreed to make 23 monthly payments of £205.45 and a final payment of £205.36 to 
Honeycomb Finance. 
Mr D complained to Honeycomb Finance in March 2021 that he and his wife had been 
unable to travel throughout 2020 due to the government imposed restrictions in response to 
the pandemic and were unable to make further travel plans due to his health issues. 
Honeycomb Finance said that the holiday company had no control over government travel 
restrictions but had extended the membership to March 2023. It said that it was unable to 
issue a refund. Mr D wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service. The loan has been repaid to Honeycomb Finance and Mr D has sadly passed away 
since then.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
there had been a breach of contract by the holiday company and that, because it had 
extended the time to take holidays to March 2023, Mrs D hadnt lost out. She said that the 
membership was no longer suitable for Mrs D but she was unable to cancel the agreement 
due to a change in her circumstances. 
Mrs D, on behalf of the estate of her late husband, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. She has responded in detail and has provided further 
documents about this complaint. She has described the difficulties that shes experienced in 
booking holidays and says that there are no holidays to book. She says that the holiday 
company has stopped trading and its business has been transferred to another holiday 
company  but it hasnt contacted her. She also says that an exchange programme was 
included with the membership but hasnt been honoured. She says that her dad passed 
away unexpectedly three months after theyd entered into the agreement. shes not used the 
membership and its illegal to have a debt with no goods or services ever received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr D paid for the trial membership using credit in the form of a loan from Honeycomb 
Finance and, in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or 
the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold this complaint, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and that Honeycomb 
Finances response to the claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of that claim as only a court would be able to do that so 
Im considering whether or not Honeycomb Finances response to the claim was fair 
and reasonable;
Mr and Mrs D signed the trial membership agreement which gave them the right to 
take five holiday weeks during the following three year period;
the agreement said: We understand that we will only be entitled to occupation of 
weeks in Apartments and at Resorts and that the exchange programme was for 
exchanges only and that additional fees would apply;
Mrs D has described the difficulties that shes experienced with booking holidays 
since her husband passed away  but the complaint to Honeycomb Finance was 
made because theyd been unable to travel throughout 2020 due to the government 
imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic and were unable to make further 
travel plans due to Mr Ds health issues;
the holiday company has extended the trial membership agreement by twelve 
months because of the issues with travel caused by the government imposed 
restrictions in response to the pandemic  and I consider that to be a fair and 
reasonable response to those issues - I also understand that holidays were available 
in the UK;
Mr and Mrs D would have been able to withdraw from the trial membership 
agreement within 14 days and Mr D was also able to withdraw from the loan 
agreement within 14 days  but they had no other right to withdraw from those 
agreements due to a change in their circumstances, whether that change was 
caused by health issues or other factors;
Ive not seen any evidence to show that Mrs D has complained to the holiday 
company or Honeycomb Finance about any issues with their exchange programme 
membership being lost or not honoured  if Mrs D wants to make a complaint about 
those issues she should first complain to Honeycomb Finance and then, if shes not 
satisfied with its response, she may be able to make a separate complaint about that 
to this service;
the holiday company has stopped trading - which would be a breach of contract  but 
the holiday club is now operated by another holiday company and Mrs Ds trial 
membership continues until March 2023 and has remained available so, even though 
shes had no use of the trial membership, it was available for her to use;
I consider that to be a suitable remedy for the breach of contract and Im not 
persuaded that Honeycomb Finance would have any further liability to the estate of 
the late Mr D under section 75 arising from that breach of contract;
Mrs D has described the difficulties that shes experienced booking holidays  but Im 
not persuaded that those difficulties show that theres been a breach of contract by 
the holiday company;
Mrs D tried to book a cruise using her membership but was told that it was outside of 
her trial membership  the trial membership agreement only applies to occupation of 
weeks in Apartments and at Resorts so I consider that the holiday company acted 
correctly in saying that the cruise was outside of the trial membership;I can understand Mrs Ds frustration and disappointment that she hasnt been able to 
book any holidays and that shes had no use of the trial membership but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company;
I sympathise with Mrs D for the loss of her husband (and her father) and the other 
issues that shes described and the difficulties that shes experienced in booking 
holidays but I consider that Honeycomb Finances response to this complaint was fair 
and reasonable; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Honeycomb Finance to refund to the estate of the late Mr D any of the money that Mr 
and Mrs D paid for the trial membership, to pay it any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D as the 
representative of the estate of her late husband to accept or reject my decision before 
6 April 2023.
