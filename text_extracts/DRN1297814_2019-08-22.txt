K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, lent to him irresponsibly 
after it failed  to make  proper affordability checks  before approving  payday  loans. 
background
Mr M was given  29 instalment loans  by Lending  Stream between 24 December 2012 and 
2 June 2016. Using the information from Lending Stream  I have used one of its loan tables 
(adapted slightly) and it appears at the end of this decision. I refer to the loans by the 
numbers in that table.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ms complaint. He thought  that Lending Stream  should  
put things right for Mr M from Loan 6 to Loan 29. 
Mr M didnt  disagree with our adjudicators view from which I take it that Mr M is content  with 
the non-uphold  opinion  in relation to Loans  1 to 5. So I think that they have been resolved 
and I do not plan to review  them.  
Lending Stream didnt  agree with our adjudicators view. So the case was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to issue a decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Mr M could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN12978142There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Mr M could sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) and its predecessor 
the Irresponsible  Lending Guide published  by the Office of Fair Trading defined  sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties. In particular the customer  should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments,  and without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
I have looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Ms lending history  with Lending Stream with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Lending  Stream should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending  Stream  should 
have realised that it should not have provided  any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
Loan 6. I say this because  by the time of Loan  6, Mr M had been  borrowing from Lending  
Stream for over nine months  without any significant  break in that lending.  During  that time, 
he had borrowed five instalment loans, and each of Mr Ms loans, after his first, were taken 
while he still had an outstanding balance with Lending Stream. This pattern of lending  ought 
to have concerned  Lending Stream, as I think that it would have indicated Mr M was having 
difficulty with his finances. 
In addition, with Loan 6, Lending Stream could have seen that Mr M was still requesting an 
amount of Â£300  - similar to what he had sought with his first loan, and his fifth. This would 
have further highlighted that his finances werent  improving,  despite these loans being 
intended as a short term cash-flow solution. 
So from the overall pattern of lending by the time of Loan 6, I think  that Lending Stream 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable.
Following Loan  6, Lending  Stream went on to lend a further 23 loans to Mr M, over a period 
of around 32 months. Each of these  loans overlapped  with more than one previous loan, and 
the overall amounts being borrowed werent  decreasing. 
I think these loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time. And I believe the number  of loans 
alone was likely to have had negative implications  on his ability to access mainstream  credit, 
and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost  loans.
Ref: DRN12978143So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 6 to 29, because  the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful,  
and he lost out as a result.
what Lending Stream should do to put things right
To put things right for Mr M, Lending  Stream should:
refund all the interest and charges paid as a result of loans 6 to 29; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement ;
the number of loans  taken by Loan 6, and onwards, means any information  recorded 
about these loans is adverse. So all entries about  loans 6 to 29 should be removed 
from Mr Ms credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  It must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mr Ms complaint in part. Gain  Credit LLC, 
trading as Lending Stream should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 September  2019.
