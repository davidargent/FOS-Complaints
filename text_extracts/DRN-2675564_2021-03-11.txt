The complaint
Mr D complains about the way that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as 
Audi Finance, has dealt with the end of a hire purchase agreement under which a car had 
been supplied to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr D under a hire purchase agreement with Audi Finance that he 
signed in January 2016. The agreement ended in July 2019 and Audi Finance sent him a 
default notice later that month because he hadnt returned the car and hadnt made the final 
payment. He asked for an extension of time and then complained to Audi Finance that he 
hadnt been contacted regarding the end of his agreement and that it should have been 
aware not to try to debit the final payment due to the arrears on his account. 
Mr D wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator 
recommended that his complaint about not receiving reminder letters about his agreement 
ending should be upheld and that Audi Finance should pay him £100 for the trouble and 
upset that he was caused. But he didnt consider that the other parts of Mr Ds complaint 
should be upheld.
Mr D has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. Hes provided a copy 
of an e-mail that he sent to Audi Finance before the default notice expired which he says 
summarises the phone conversation that he had with Audi Finance after hed received the 
default notice, clearly mentions his offer to give the car back and also asks about his options. 
He says that Audi Finance was able to collect all payments except the final payment, other 
than two payments that he missed, so he asks why it didnt issue a default notice for the two 
missed payments rather than £11,333.79. He also says that the agreement that he signed 
isnt a hire purchase agreement as it doesnt give him the option to give the car back.
Audi Finance says its unfair to ask it to pay Mr D £100 as a gesture of goodwill for letters it 
isnt obliged to send. It agrees that its best practice to send those letters but it isnt legally 
obliged to send them and it correctly issued the one month reminder to him. It says that it 
would be happy to offer £25 to £50 as a gesture of goodwill.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr D signed the hire purchase agreement for the car to be supplied to him  the price 
of the car was £23,424 and he agreed to make 41 monthly payments of £353.77 and 
a final payment of £10,615.25 (plus a £10 option to purchase fee);
Im satisfied that it was a hire purchase agreement and that Mr D had the option to 
return the car at the end of the agreement if he didnt want to make the final payment;
he didnt make all of the payments that were due under the agreement and he was 
sent arrears notices for the missed payments;
Audi Finance sent him a letter in June 2019 about the end of his agreement and set 
out the options that were available to him  including returning the car, refinancing 
and making the final payment of £10,626.25;
Mr D says that he didnt receive that letter but it was correctly addressed to him and I 
consider it to be more likely than not that the letter was sent to him even if he didnt 
receive it;
even if he didnt receive that letter, I consider that Mr D ought reasonably to have 
known that his agreement was ending  but he didnt contact Audi Finance to 
refinance or to return the car so it tried to collect the final payment of £10,625.25;
Im not persuaded that Audi Finance shouldnt have tried to collect the final payment 
from him because of the outstanding arrears on his account;
it was unable to collect that payment so it sent a default notice to Mr D for the amount 
of the final payment and the other arrears on his account;
Mr D responded to the default notice by the e-mail referred to above and Audi 
Finance sent a letter to Mr D in August 2019 which said that he would be contacted 
by its partner either for the return of the car or full settlement; 
Mr D didnt return the car or pay the outstanding amount to Audi Finance so it 
obtained a court order for the return of the car and received it back in December 
2020  the car was then sold and the sale proceeds were applied to his account 
which reduced his outstanding balance to £4,385.79  which it says is still 
outstanding;
Audi Finance says that its best practice to notify a customer six months and four 
months before the end of the agreement (but it didnt send those letters to Mr D)  
and its legally obliged to notify the customer one month before the end of the 
agreement so it wrote to Mr D in June 2019, one month before the end of the 
agreement, explaining that it was coming to an end; 
although it wasnt legally obliged to send the letters to Mr D six months and four 
months before the end of his agreement, I consider that it would be fair and 
reasonable to expect it to have complied with what it says is best practice and to 
have sent those letters to Mr D  if it had done so I consider that some of the issues 
that have since taken place may have been avoided;
I consider that its failure to send those letters to Mr D has caused him some distress 
and inconvenience and I find that it would be fair and reasonable for it to pay him 
£100 to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience; and
other than that, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Audi 
Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the end of Mr Ds hire purchase 
agreement.Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Audi Finance to pay £100 to Mr D to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused. But I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to reduce or waive 
the outstanding balance of his account, to pay him any other compensation, to remove any 
adverse information that its recorded on his credit file or to take any other action in response 
to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint in part and I order Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Finance, to pay him £100 to compensate him for the 
distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2021.
