The complaint
Mr S is unhappy because PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has made a payment to an
electronic marketplace from his account after he had cancelled authorisations to do so.
What happened
Mr S sold an item on an electronic marketplace Ill call M and the buyer credited £548.95 to
his PayPal account on 7 October 2020.
Mr S says he went into the automatic payments section on his PayPal account on 11 or 12
October 2020 and cancelled the authorisation instruction for M.
The buyer complained the item didnt work when it arrived. The buyer says the item was
returned and requested a refund.
Mr S says he opened a case with M on 18 October against the buyer claiming the item
hadnt been returned.
M upheld the dispute in the buyers favour and M refunded £548.95 to the buyer on
22 October 2020. M then claimed the £548.95 from Mr Ss PayPal account and it was
debited on 1 November 2020. As the balance of Mr Ss account was less than the refund
prior to the debit this meant that on 1 November 2020 Mr S owed PayPal £356.74.
Mr S contacted PayPal using its online chat facility and asked why it had allowed M to take
money from his account when he had disabled disputed payments. PayPal told him that as
the disputed payment was with M, it couldnt investigate the matter because it was the
financial services provider.
The investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He was satisfied M had begun
investigating the buyers dispute before Mr S switched off payments and refunds to M. So,
he didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong.
Mr S disagreed with the investigators view. He said:
PayPal is wrong to assert that the case was submitted before the cancellation of the 
direct debit on 12 October 2020. The case that was decided against him was 
submitted by him (the seller) on 18 October 2020 well after the cancellation of the 
direct debit and was subsequently decided on 22 October 2020. Therefore, PayPal 
had no right to issue payment.
M requires an automatic payment detail on its account if it needs to charge the 
sellers account for fees or any dispute. But he had removed his PayPal account for 
any such payments prior to this case so M did not have a mandate to charge his 
PayPal account.
PayPal as custodian of clients money should have asked M to produce an active 
consent on its account for this demand. But PayPal has refused to demand M 
produce this mandate.
PayPal has been flip-flopping from one point of view to another. On 1 November 
2020 it presented an entirely different reason and said that it was a debt transfer from 
his account with M to his PayPal account. But he never consented to have a debt 
transfer made to his PayPal account from any one.
The investigator issued a second view. In it he said PayPal had confirmed that M had begun
its investigation before Mr S cancelled his authority on 12 October 2020. After M upheld the
buyers dispute it then asked PayPal for the £548.95 back as allowed by the user
agreement which Mr S had with PayPal. PayPal then debited Mr Ss account. So, the
investigator didn't think PayPal had done anything wrong here.
Mr S reiterated that he had cancelled the direct debit with both PayPal and M. He says:
PayPals terms are only effective if M had his PayPal account on its platform as a 
source of funds for fees and disputes. PayPal is assuming that M had this consent on 
its platform and hence it had to comply based on PayPals terms but that was not the 
case. And PayPal failed to investigate this when he provided screenshots showing 
this was not the case.
The dispute was started by him and started on 18 October after he had cancelled the 
direct debit on 12 October 2020.
Payment was not taken as a direct debit because there was no mandate; it was 
rather carried out as a debt transfer. And he never gave consent to allow PayPal to 
transfer a debt from a third company and especially a disputed one. There was no 
clause permitting this in the user agreement.
PayPals user agreement says: you can also cancel this instruction by contacting 
us. It doesnt say that if PayPal has been notified of the mere existence of a case, 
not the decision, then the cancellation of such payments will be considered 
ineffective for those claims. Moreover, it never explicitly states that PayPal will have a 
right to debit all funds available and issue an unauthorised overdraft to cover the rest. 
There was never an unauthorised overdraft agreed. There simply are no such written 
agreed clauses in the agreement with PayPal and PayPal is misinterpreting the user 
agreement in a way that suits it.
He also thinks Ms agreement doesnt provide for PayPal to make a payment to it if 
that payment would make the PayPal account become overdrawn.My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on 15 July 2021. In it I said:
The PayPal user agreement provides: We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces
to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case
may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace's own resolution process,
which we call marketplace due amounts. If you give such an authorisation and the
marketplace has notified us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any
marketplace due amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that
marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace's instructions
to us. It goes on to say: You can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.
I am satisfied that the buyer raised a dispute with M and in turn M notified PayPal of the
dispute prior to Mr S going into his PayPal account and cancelling the authorisation. 
M hadnt completed the resolution process by the date PayPal has told us Mr S cancelled
the authorisation. Mr S thinks PayPal should not have paid M the due amounts in these
circumstances. He also thinks that PayPal should have investigated Ms request for money
after he told it that he had cancelled similar authorisations with M.
Having looked at the wording carefully I think the user agreement could have been a lot
clearer about when a cancellation would take effect in the circumstances of a claim having
already been notified to PayPal. I can understand why Mr S thought that his actions would
have prevented PayPal returning the £548.95 to M.
The services jurisdiction requires me to come to a decision which is fair and reasonable in
all the circumstances of the case. So, Ive thought about what is fair and reasonable here.
Looking at all the circumstances of the case I am very sympathetic to Mr S. He feels he has
been scammed by the buyer and M hasnt considered the facts properly. But it feels
inherently unfair for PayPal to have to suffer the loss here. Mr Ss dispute is really with the
buyer and M, not PayPal. It doesnt seem fair for somebody to avoid a liability to somebody
by simply switching off the payment authority. And therefore, whilst I remain sympathetic to
Mr S I dont intend to order PayPal to reimburse him.
Mr S has said he didnt agree for his PayPal account to go overdrawn. It is for PayPal to
decide if it will make a payment in circumstances where it will cause the account to have a
negative balance.
Responses to my provisional decision
PayPal had no further comments to make.
Mr S disagreed with it. In summary he said: 
as the direct debit was cancelled before the payment demand date any payment 
made would violate the direct debit guarantee
so, as the payment wasnt made by direct debit it was a debit transfer which he never 
agreed to and so PayPal had aided and abetted theft
looking at PayPal and Ms user agreements together PayPal should have upheld its 
commitment to let M deal with him directly by issuing an invoice to him
he thinks I should reconsider my provisional decision in light of the financial 
irregularities PayPal has committed and the actions it has taken which were never 
agreed in user agreement.
he thinks my provisional decision is partial and sympathetic towards PayPal.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr Ss strength of feeling here and I am sorry he feels I am partial and 
sympathetic towards PayPal. As I said in my provisional decision, I am very sympathetic to 
Mr S. I appreciate Mr Ss detailed point and his emphasis on what he sees as the financial 
irregularities which have occurred.
As an ombudsman I need to look at what is fair in all the circumstances. That means taking 
a step back and looking at the situation as a whole. Here Mr S sold an item and had agreed 
that if there was a dispute about the sale M would determine that dispute. He had also given 
authority for that payment to be returned if M found against him. But after the dispute was 
raised and after M had told PayPal about the dispute, he withdrew the authority. In my view, 
this placed PayPal in a difficult position. Because of the user agreement and ultimately how 
disputes are dealt with, I can understand why PayPal allowed the account to be debited.  To 
do anything different would have meant another party stood the loss and that doesnt feel fair 
here. 
It follows that I dont require PayPal to do anything further to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
