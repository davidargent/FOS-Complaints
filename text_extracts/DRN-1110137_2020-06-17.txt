The complaint
Mrs G complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc(NatWest) dealt with a 
chargeback.
What happened
Mrs G paid £100 for an airport transfer with a taxi firm. The taxi firm was unable to pick her 
up from the airport and agreed to refund Mrs G £50. Mrs G says the £50 was refunded on 29 
May 2019 but taken back out of her account the same day as well as a further £50. She says 
she asked NatWest to raise a chargeback but it said it could not. Mrs G says she then spent 
time trying to sort matters out before NatWest did agree to raise a chargeback and repaid 
the money. She says NatWest then paid £50 into her account before taking the money out, 
Mrs G would like her money back and further compensation for what has taken place.
NatWest accepts it ought to have raised a chargeback when Mrs G  called it on 19 June 
2019. It says it did raise a chargeback for the first payment and paid £50 as a gesture of 
goodwill for the second £50 being debited. NatWest says it was entitled to ask Mrs G for 
further information about the transaction and has paid £30 compensation for what took place 
and refunded her call costs.
Mrs G brought her complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest had dealt fairly with 
it. The investigator thought the problem was caused by the taxi company. But NatWest had 
given Mrs G incorrect information when she called, before correcting the position some four 
days later. The investigator thought the compensation was fair and reasonable and that we 
couldn't look into NatWest's complaint handling and the deduction of the £50 gesture of 
goodwill payment.
Mrs G doesn't accept that view and maintains the compensation should be increased.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Mrs G will be disappointed by my decision and I 
appreciate how strongly she feels about what's taken place. 
I'm satisfied the problems here were mainly caused by the actions of the taxi company. I can 
see that it was unable to pick Mrs G and her family up from an airport, and then agreed to 
refund £50 but deducted it shortly after refunding it. I appreciate that NatWest ought to have 
been able to have raised a chargeback when Mrs G called it and there is no question that 
NatWest didn't deal appropriately with Mrs G's complaint. I have no doubt that caused Mrs G 
inconvenience and resulted in a wasted call to a different business.
I have listened to the call between the parties that took place shortly after Mrs G was given 
incorrect information. I'm satisfied that NatWest provided correct information during that call and apologised for the earlier call. I'm also satisfied it acted fairly by agreeing to raise a 
chargeback,  paying £50 as a  gesture of goodwill as well as compensation and call costs. I 
think at that stage Mrs G appeared to accept that offer and resolution.
I appreciate that the £50 gesture of goodwill was debited from Mrs G's account. It's not clear 
why that took place but in any event I can see that it has been credited again to Mrs G's 
account. The investigator has explained that payment is connected to NatWest's complaint 
handling process and not something we would intervene in. I can also see that NatWest 
hasn't looked into that matter and would need to do so before we could have considered if 
we could have looked at that part of the complaint.
Overall I'm satisfied NatWest has fairly apologised for the part of the complaint it was 
responsible for and has paid what I think is a fair and reasonable level of compensation. I 
don't think Mrs G suffered any financial loss as a result of the incorrect advice NatWest gave 
her or as a result of its actions. I'm also satisfied that NatWest was entitled to ask Mrs G for 
further information to support a  chargeback claim and I don't think such requests are 
unusual or unfair. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2020.
