K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains on behalf of D a limited company about the reserve amount applied by 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to a PayPal account  after a review  in June 2019.
He says that the reserve amount that PayPal are applying will affect Ds cashflow and the 
business. He says that he has repeatedly asked where this money is held and if the reserves  
can be reduced, but PayPal will not agree to any reduction.
background
Mr R says that from memory, he thinks he opened the PayPal account in 2009.  He says that 
he does not remember  receiving a copy of Ds user agreement.
PayPal say the account was opened  in 2007 and have provided a screenshot  of Mr Rs 
agreement to open an account. They say that the account was opened in Mr Rs personal 
name but in opening the account he would have registered the business account, and 
accepted PayPals user agreement. 
In June 2019, D applied to PayPal  for a pro virtual terminal review from PayPal. This is a 
payment processing  solution built on PayPal technology and enables  a merchant to accept 
credit card payments online as well as processing mobile and retail credit cards. D had been 
using this service since  2017.
Following this review PayPal placed reserves  (a holding charge) on the business account.  
This means  that PayPal will take 20% of all transactions  via PayPal and hold them  for 
60 days. 
D says that this action  by PayPal will damage  the business and could  put them under and 
says that this wasnt mentioned at the time of the review. D has cancelled the pro account,  
in the hope that the account can go back to how it was before the application  for the PayPal 
Pro account review, but PayPal will not agree to this.
Mr R, on behalf of D complained to PayPal and showed concerns about Ds cashflow and 
wanted to know  specifically where the reserves are held. 
On behalf of D, Mr R asked for reassurance that the funds are protected  like the risk 
assessment that PayPal  introduced to protect  their assets via holding funds, Id like to know 
if these same funds are at risk should PayPal run into financial problems.
PayPal have issued  a final response letter and say reserves were placed  as a result  of an 
internal risk review having been taken  of Ds business and it is entitled to do this in line with 
the terms and conditions of the user agreement 
PayPal also offered D a Working Capital Facility  (WCF) as D was worried about cashflow, 
but once D accepted this and found out about the 20% reserve and complained  to PayPal,  
PayPal have explored the possibility of allowing it to repay the WCF (which  is not normally  
repayable after 3 days).
Ref: DRN44493072D asks why on the one hand PayPal would take a 20% reserve over 60 days  after a risk 
review, but then offer a WCF. There is no evidence that the WCF  has been  cancelled.
D has had various discussions with PayPal, trying to get the reserve  reduced to below 20%,  
however PayPal have  said that on the information  provided by D and its accountant, the 
minimum reserve they are willing to consider is 20%.
PayPal have agreed for the rolling  reserves be removed  and a minimum reserve  applied  
instead on 19 June  2019. The account is eligible  for review 180 days  from then.
PayPal have said that the new reserve of £27,690 will be held based on an average  monthly  
income of £120,000, but if more than £120,000  is received,  another review may trigger and 
the reserve may change.
D has threatened to leave  the PayPal service  and whilst PayPal are saying they would  not 
wish to lose the business, they are unable to reduce the reserves  any further.
D says that PayPal have still not dealt with the questions on where  the reserves  are kept and 
what they do with them. 
D has raised the complaint with PayPal and then with this service.
 PayPal have offered  £100 compensation for not notifying D of the reserves but does  not 
believe that the reserves applied have been  applied incorrectly.
Our investigator has looked at all the available evidence and has referred  to the clauses 
within the User agreement that D has agreed  to, in particular clauses 10.4 Reserves  and 
10.7 Disclosure of reasons for our actions. 
They are clearly set out in the initial investigation and referred  to in my findings below. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said PayPal have acted  in line with the 
user agreement after reviewing the change activity  on Ds business account.  She said that 
even though D has a 100% seller status  on eBay  and says that this should be taken into 
account when  setting the reserves,  PayPal  are acting within the terms of the user agreement 
and have carried out a review of the accounts and it would be unfair to say they had done  
anything wrong.
Our investigator also picked up on the poor communication about the reserves and agreed 
that it was not evident that D was provided  with notice which  PayPal says should  have 
happened. D is not happy with the Investigators findings and says that PayPal have acted 
unfairly and outside  their own policy.
Ref: DRN44493073my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done this, I am not upholding this 
complaint and I will explain the reasons why below. 
I appreciate that D feels strongly about the situation and I hope my explanation will help it 
understand why Ive reached this decision.
In seeing whether the reserves have been applied fairly to Ds account, I have to determine 
whether PayPal have  applied  the user terms fairly.
 I have referred to clause  10.4 Reserves. 
PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a Reserve on funds  held in your Account when 
PayPal reasonably believes  there may be a higher  than acceptable level of risk 
associated with your Account. If PayPal places a Reserve on funds  in your Account, the
funds will be held in your Reserve Account and those funds will be shown  as "pending"  in 
your PayPal Balance. If your Account is subject to a Reserve, PayPal will provide you with a 
notice specifying  the terms of the Reserve.  The terms may require that a certain percentage 
of the amounts received  into your Account are held for a certain period of time, or that a 
certain amount  of money  is held in reserve, or anything else that PayPal determines  is 
necessary to protect against the risk associated with your Account. PayPal may change  the 
terms of the Reserve  at any time by providing  you with notice of the new terms. You may 
close your Account if you object to the Reserve. If your Account is closed for any reason, we 
have the right to hold the Reserve  for up to 180 Days. 
The clause does  say that PayPal can place  a reserve  on funds in an account if it considers 
there to be a higher  than acceptable level of risk associated  with your account In this 
situation, I can see that PayPal have carried out a risk review  of the account by obtaining 
information from D and its accountant. The clause has not been used unfairly.
Turning to Ds request  for information on how and where the reserves are held, I refer to 
clause 10.7 below.  PayPal are not obliged to provide such details and again, in my opinion,  
they are not acting  unfairly in relying  on this clause in the user agreement.
10.7 Disclosure of reasons for our actions
Our decisions to take the actions set out in this section 10 and any other  actions we take 
under this Agreement, whether they restrict or extend your access to the Service,  our 
infrastructure, our websites, our software  or our systems (including any networks  and 
servers used to provide  any of the Services)  whether operated  by us or on our behalf 
(including, without  limitation, any blockages, limitations,  suspensions, terminations,  holds  
and reserves) may be based on confidential  criteria that are essential to our management  of 
risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers. In addition, we 
may be restricted by regulation or a governmental  authority from disclosing certain  
information to you about such decisions. We have no obligation  to disclose the details of our 
risk management or security procedures or our confidential information to you.
Ref: DRN44493074It is not for this service to comment or advise on the internal processes and systems a 
business uses and we cant force PayPal to provide an explanation of how the reserves are 
held and where. 
My remit  is to see whether PayPal  has acted fairly and it is not unreasonable  for a business 
to follow  its terms and conditions after reviewing the account.
Whilst I appreciate the frustration that D has experienced here, for the reasons stated, I am 
not upholding this complaint as I cannot see that PayPal have acted unfairly  other than not 
sending notification of the reserve. 
For omitting to send D the notification,  they have offered the sum of £100.  
The £100  compensation  is for not notifying D of the reserves  in accordance with their terms 
and conditions. As this service cannot  usually award compensation for trouble and upset to a 
limited company, I leave  it to Mr R on behalf of D to decide whether he wishes  to accept  the 
sum of £100  from PayPal.
I appreciate that D will be disappointed with my decision, but Ive looked  at all the 
circumstances and as PayPal are not acting unfairly,  I am unable to uphold this complaint.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.
