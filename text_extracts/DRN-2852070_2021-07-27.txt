The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as G, are unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) managed the business banking relationship.
What happened
G took a business loan from NatWest to develop a property. The intention was to develop 
seven flats on the site. 
The development was completed, and two flats were sold in 2008. However, G couldnt sell 
any further flats until they were eventually sold by the receivers in 2014.
As a result of the failure to sell the flats, in September 2011 the management of Gs 
business account was reassigned to a Specialist Relationship Manager (SRM) and 
subsequently transferred to the Specialist Management Unit (SMU) in November of that 
year.
After several extensions to the loan, in October 2013 NatWest appointed independent 
marketing support for the unsold flats who provided recommendations to G on how to 
proceed. G didnt act on the recommendations provided to it and the flats remained unsold. 
This led to NatWest appointing receivers to sell the remaining unsold properties in the Spring 
of 2014.
The receivers succeeded in selling the flats. After the final sale, NatWest wrote off a 
substantial sum which remained outstanding and closed Gs account.
G wasnt happy about what had taken place and believed that NatWest had acted 
unreasonably in the way it had charged fees and increased margins when it had renewed 
the loan. G also felt that the independent marketing review had been unnecessary and had 
led to unreasonable fees being charged.
G also felt that NatWest hadnt been supportive and had forced the sale of the properties at 
under market values. So, G raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Gs complaint, but it was satisfied with how it had managed the loan 
account and the business relationship with G. So, NatWest didnt uphold the complaint.
G wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so it referred its complaint to this service. One 
of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that NatWest hadnt acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in how it had managed Gs account or with the level of support 
NatWest had provided to G over the course of what had taken place. So, they also didnt 
uphold the complaint.
G remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
G has raised several complaint points that were addressed by NatWest in two different 
complaint response letters  one covering the period when Gs relationship was managed by 
the SRM, and one from the business as usual team at NatWest. However, from the 
perspective of this service, Im satisfied that these two separate complaints can be 
considered as one unified complaint and I have therefore considered all the complaint points 
raised by G within my review.
G have stated that they believe that NatWest wasnt supportive regarding the difficult 
position that G found itself in and it feels that NatWests actions exacerbated the problems 
that G was facing, rather than helping G overcome them.
Im not convinced by Gs position here, and one reason that I say this is because, following 
the completion of the project in 2008 and the subsequent failure of G to sell most of the 
developed flats, NatWest continued to extend Gs loan facility for several years beyond the 
original term of the loan.
NatWest did appoint receivers to sell the unsold properties in 2014, but given the overdue 
status of the loan, it would have been within NatWests rights to have taken this step much 
sooner than they eventually did. As such, Im satisfied that NatWest did provide to G a 
degree of forbearance and support that enabled the property project to continue as an 
ongoing concern above and beyond that which was mandated by the terms and conditions 
of the business loan that G entered into with NatWest.
G have also stated that they believe that NatWest forced it to sell the unsold properties at 
below market rates. But again, it must be recognised that NatWest effectively gave G a 
period of over five years beyond the initially agreed loan redemption date to arrange the sale 
of remaining developed properties, but that G were unable to arrange these sales. 
Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that NatWest were under no obligation to extend Gs 
loan facility indefinitely, and following Gs non-acceptance of the recommendations put 
forward by the NatWest appointed marketing review, I feel that it was reasonable in 2014 for 
NatWest to appoint receivers to arrange the sale the properties and to recover as much of 
NatWests financial outlay for NatWest as possible at that time.
In its correspondence with this service, G has stated that it feels that NatWest didnt 
sufficiently monitor the actions of the receivers to ensure that the best possible sale price for 
the flats was secured. However, Im satisfied that having appointed the receivers, NatWest 
were entitled to accept the judgement of the receivers, and I dont feel that the level of 
monitoring that G refers to here is consistent with the act of appointing a specialist third party 
to undertake the specific tasks that the receivers were instructed to complete. 
G also believe that NatWest reviewed the loan account too often and charged excessive 
fees to G as a result, and G has also stated that it is unhappy with how NatWest increased 
the margin following account reviews.
Having reviewed Gs loan account, its evident that account reviews were initially undertaken 
annually but then became more frequent following the failure of G to repay the loan by the 
original redemption date because of the non-sale of the majority of the developed flats. 
This doesnt seem unreasonable to me, and I would expect a lender to increase the 
frequency of account reviews in response to an increase in perceived risk, such as NatWest 
have confirmed was the case in this instance.Following reviews, NatWest agreed to extend Gs loan facility on several occasions, and G 
incurred several arrangement fees as a result of this. Arrangement fees are a normal part of 
agreeing banking facilities and I dont consider NatWests application of these fees to be 
unfair or excessive. 
It also must be noted that even though NatWest increased the frequency of its reviews, it 
amended the rate of the fee charged to ensure that G wasnt charged more than 1.5% a 
year. For example, if a fee was charged for a loan extension after six months, then NatWest 
charged half the annual fee. This feels fair to me.
With regard the margin, its evident that NatWest only increased this once, by 0.75% in 
2012. It must be noted that at that time the developed flats had remained unsold for four 
years past the intended project finish. In consideration of this, I dont feel that it was 
excessive for NatWest to have increased the margin on this occasion, especially given the 
increase in perceived risk that the ongoing non-sale of the developed flats had caused.
G also stated that it feels that the marketing review was unnecessary and caused G to incur 
unnecessary fees as a result. However, it must be recognised once more that by the time 
that NatWest initiated the marketing review, the flats had been unsold for several years and 
Gs loan facility had been extended on several occasions beyond the term of the initial 
agreement. 
Because of this, I dont feel that it was unreasonable for NatWest to have sought to find a 
resolution in the manner that they did here and to have initiated the marketing review. I also 
dont feel that it would have been fair for NatWest to have borne the cost for this review, and 
so Im satisfied that it was reasonable for G to have incurred a charge for the marketing 
review.
G has also expressed its dissatisfaction at the number of Relationship Managers (RMs) it 
has had during its business relationship with NatWest. However, its notable that the same 
RM was assigned to Gs account from the loan being initially agreed in 2007 until May 2012, 
and that while there were three other RMs assigned to Gs account in the following years, it 
was only on one occasion where one of these RMs was in place for a short period of time. 
So, while I can appreciate that G may have wanted a singular point of contact throughout the 
lifetime of the business relationship, I dont feel that the number of RMs assigned to Gs 
account was unduly excessive - especially given the approximate 8 year length of that 
relationship. 
Finally, G have stated that NatWest mis-sold the business loan initially on the basis that the 
force majeure clause wasnt properly explained. However, I dont feel that this is an aspect of 
Gs complaint that its within the remit of this service to consider.
The Financial Ombudsman Service isnt free to consider every complaint thats brought to it. 
The rules that were governed by set out the complaints we can and cant look at. Theyre 
called the Dispute Resolution (DISP) rules and are found in the Financial Conduct 
Authoritys handbook.
These rules include certain time limits. In particular, DISP 2.8.2 says that unless the
business involved gives its consent, or if exceptional circumstances apply, the ombudsman 
cant consider a complaint if the complainant refers it to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
more than:
(a) six years after the event complained of; or (if later)(b) three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought 
reasonably to have become aware) that they had cause for complaint
The initial sale of the loan was something that happened more than six years before G made 
its complaint. Also, Im satisfied that when G first had sight of the loan agreement it ought 
reasonably to have known that it didnt understand the force majeure clause at the time.
Furthermore, NatWest hasnt given its consent for this service to consider this aspect of Gs 
complaint, and I cant see that the exceptional circumstances clause applies in this instance. 
As such, Im satisfied that this isnt an aspect of Gs complaint that this service can consider 
at this time.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that G was wanting, but having considered all of the 
information here, Im unable to conclude that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably in 
this instance. 
It follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or asking NatWest to take any 
further action at this time. I hope that G can understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive 
made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
