K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket  was 
irresponsible when  it provided him with a number of loans. 
background
For ease of reference Ill refer to CashEuroNet UK LLC as CEN.
I've prepared a table  showing  some  of the information CEN has provided about Mr Bs loans. 
This can be found at the end of this decision in the annex. 
There were two distinct chains of borrowing  separated by a period of around four years. 
The first chain included  six payday loans and a flexcredit account (Loans 1 to 7). These were 
taken between 30 October 2012 and 31 July 2013 (although  the flexcredit account wasnt 
settled until 30 June  2014). All of these loans  were provided by QuickQuid.
The second  chain began on 30 May 2018  and the last advance was made on 
9 November 2018.  These are Loans 8 to 13. Loan  10 was an instalment loan provided by 
Pounds to Pocket.  The rest were payday loans from QuickQuid. From the statement of 
account provided by CEN it seemed that there was an outstanding  balance on Loan 13. 
The table shows that some of the payday  loans were topped  up on one or more  occasions. 
This means  that Mr B increased  the amount of principal he borrowed before hed repaid the 
original loan. To identify  these in the table  I've added a letter to the loan number.  For 
example Loan  4 was topped twice and these top-ups are identified  as 4a and 4b.
CEN initially objected  to this Service looking into Loan 1 because it said Mr B had 
complained too late. Our adjudicator went on to explain  why he thought this Service could 
look into Loan 1 and went on to consider the merits of Mr Bs whole complaint. 
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Bs complaint about Loans  6 and 7 and the top up to 
Loan 13 should be upheld. CEN didnt agree so the matter  came to me for a decision. 
A few weeks  ago I issued  a provisional  decision explaining why I was minded to uphold  
more aspects of Mr Bs complaint. I invited the parties to let me have any further comments  
or evidence  they wanted me to consider before  I make my final decision.
Mr B has told me that he accepts my provisional decision and recently provided evidence 
that Loan 13 has been repaid. CEN has also sent a response. It doesnt agree with my 
provisional conclusions.
  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Ref: DRN58834602I mention above  that Mr B accepts  my provisional decision. CEN has sent an email 
message, the contents of which had been included in its response to our adjudicators  
assessment so I had taken those into account when  I reached my provisional decision. 
Although CEN hasnt  provided me with anything new,  Ive nevertheless  considered the 
points it raised, once again.  Having done so, I'm not persuaded to change  my mind. 
This is what  I said in my provisional  decision:
For most  of Mr Bs first chain  of borrowing the regulator was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).  
Towards the end of that chain  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became  the regulator. 
Although there  were two regulatory regimes the requirements  on CEN were  broadly similar  
throughout. Indeed much  of the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook Chapter 5 - which 
relates to this type of activity - refers in great part to the OFTs Irresponsible  Lending 
Guidance. In very basic terms lenders have a duty to act responsibly and fairly. 
CEN needed  to make  checks to see whether  Mr B could afford to pay back each loan 
sustainably before  it lent to him. Theres no set list of what a lender  should do to check  
affordability in every  case.  But checks should be proportionate  to things like the size of the 
loan, the repayments, what the lender knows about  the consumer and what the consumer 
tells the lender about  their circumstances. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more 
assurance the greater the potential risk to the consumer  of not being able to repay  the credit 
in a sustainable way. 
So, for example, Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed  
checks
the higher the loan amount,
the lower the consumers income
the greater the number and frequency of the loans
the longer the lending relationship
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.  I think  its important to remember that the 
purpose of short term credit is to provide a solution to a short term cash  flow problem and 
using this type of credit to meet ongoing financial need is likely to be unsustainable.
I note that CEN  has provided us with a document relating to the checks it did at the time of Mr 
Bs second loan chain.  It says it implemented  an affordability review, which involved collecting 
and validating  income and expense  details from customers, in line with the FCA handbook. It 
has previously  sent this document to this Service as a matter of course on many of its 
complaints. It is a generic  document which  explains why CEN is of the view that all of its 
lending decisions were  made  responsibly after March  2015.
This Service has responded to CEN on this generic argument directly and through  earlier final 
decisions. As such, I am not going to expand on this point  any further here, though I have 
considered it alongside everything else in making  my decision.
And Ive thought  about these overarching  questions:
For each  loan, did CEN carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr B would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable  way?
If it didnt  carry out those  checks, would they have shown that Mr B could have repaid 
the loans sustainably?
Ref: DRN58834603Given this type of loan is intended for short-term use only, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Did CEN  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
the first chain of loans
Mr B declared  a monthly income of £704 during the period he took Loans 1 to 7. It seems that 
CEN doesnt have details of his outgoings. This was a relatively low income but I also note 
that the amounts Mr B was borrowing - to begin with - were also relatively  modest.  There was 
a gap of almost six months between Loans  1 and 2. 
In these circumstances I cant safely say CEN failed  to do enough  when it provided Mr B with 
Loans 1, 2 and 3.
However, as Mr B had topped up Loan 3 it meant that Loan 4 was his 5th advance  in 29 days. 
This pattern of borrowing was unusual  Mr B was borrowing and repaying  loans in quick 
succession  which I accept mean that he was often paying only very small  sums in interest.  
But given these circumstances  I think that CEN shouldve  been asking  for details of Mr Bs 
monthly expenses at the point  he took Loans 4 and 5. And as I havent seen that CEN did 
this, I'm not persuaded  it did enough. 
However I dont have  clear  enough information about Mr Bs circumstances at that time to 
conclude whether  CEN wouldve decided  against providing Loans 4 and 5 even if it had done 
proportionate checks.
So I'm not proposing to uphold Mr Bs complaint about  Loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
However I'm satisfied that CEN  acted  irresponsibly at the point it approved Loan 6 on 17 July 
2013. This was the eighth advance in less than two months. This is something which 
shouldve led CEN to conclude that Mr B was not using  these high cost short  term loans  for 
their intended purpose - to bridge a temporary cash flow problem. And that he was not 
managing his money  well. Mr B was repeatedly  borrowing  - one loan after another. And he 
was having to top-up loans - often on consecutive days - before repaying the original amount 
hed borrowed. He topped  up Loan 6 three times meaning that the amount repayable was 
more than £275  over 40% of his declared income. The pattern of borrowing  and the 
amounts being borrowed by the point he took Loan 6 meant this wasnt likely  to have been 
sustainable for Mr B. 
This unsustainable pattern of borrowing  continued  when,  on the day Mr B repaid Loan  6 he 
took the flexcredit loan. He was provided with a credit limit of £450  significantly more than 
hed previously borrowed. The flexcredit agreement also stated please note, this type of 
lending is a very expensive form of credit, and is not suitable for long term or regular 
borrowing but for short-medium term, borrowing needs. 
According to the agreement, if Mr B drew down  the maximum amount immediately and repaid 
the loan over a ten month period without  drawing  down again the maximum he would repay in 
any month was around £141.  But that was premised on him not making any further draw  
downs. Im mindful that this was approved after Mr B had taken five payday loans (made up of 
12 advances) over the previous ten weeks. It wasnt likely  that Mr B would only draw  down 
once on his flexcredit agreement. And indeed he proceeded to make 50 withdrawals over the 
11 months he had the account. 
With all this in mind  and, although the flexcredit was a different sort of high cost credit 
product, I am also of the opinion that CEN  shouldnt  have provided Loan 7 to Mr B. It wasnt 
Ref: DRN58834604likely hed be able to repay that sustainably either. So I intend to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
about Loans 6 and 7.  
the second chain of loans
As Ive mentioned, our adjudicator upheld  Mr Bs complaint about  the top up to Loan 13. But 
I'm minded to uphold his complaint from a much earlier point. 
I accept that it was fair for CEN to conclude that after a four year gap, even if there had been 
any dependency on short term credit in the first chain, it was likely that the situation had been 
resolved. So I think it was reasonable  for CEN  to treat this as a fresh  chain and I've borne that 
in mind when reaching  my provisional conclusions.
Throughout this second period of borrowing Mr B declared that his monthly income  was 
£1,298. CEN  also asked  him about his monthly outgoings which he declared  to be £325,  
leaving him a declared  disposable income  of £973.  CEN says it also did some  further checks  
and from those it identified an estimated monthly disposable  income (EDI) figure. However I 
note that apart  from Loan 13 it reached an EDI identical to (or very close to) the disposable 
income declared by Mr B.
At the point Mr B took Loans 8 and 9 I think CEN  shouldve been concerned about  the 
accuracy of the figures  Mr B had declared for his credit  commitments. He declared he had 
none. On the face of it Mr B had £973 of disposable  income and yet was seeking short term 
loans of £50 and he declared he had no other credit  commitments. 
However I accept that, given  the amounts  involved and how early  in the new lending 
relationship this was, CEN was reasonably entitled to rely on the information  it had. This 
suggested that Mr B could  afford to repay those two loans  sustainably.
However ten days after repaying Loan 9, Mr B changed his pattern of borrowing. He didnt go 
back to QuickQuid for a payday  loan. He applied to Pounds  to Pocket  for an instalment loan 
of £200 which was approved on 18 June 2018. This was to be repaid over six months through 
12 fortnightly instalments of £23.95.  Once again Mr B declared he had no monthly credit  
commitments.
CEN tells us that it did credit  checks on 17 and 18 June. It adds that it analysed [Mr Bs] 
current financial commitments, insolvency records, delinquency records,  County Court 
judgments, credit enquiries  and other credit accounts currently  open. In addition,  
CashEuroNet UK verified information obtained from [Mr B], we also consider an applicant's 
credit-scoring information from Credit  Reference Agencies.. plus various other 3rd party  
reports.
Mr B has provided  us with a copy of a recent credit report. According to this  the source  
being the Insolvency Service - Mr B entered a debt relief order (DRO)  on 12 June 2018 which 
was discharged on 12 June  2019. Additionally he had defaulted on a credit  card debt in April.  
Given the credit  checks CEN did on 17 and 18 June I think its likely that the DRO  wouldve  
been recorded. At this stage  (2018) credit report information was usually recorded in real time 
 with hardly any delay. But even if the DRO didnt appear  the debts which were included in it 
wouldve been  apparent   even though Mr B had been declaring to CEN that he had no 
monthly credit commitments.  
So, on its own checks CEN shouldve recognised that Mr B was in financial  difficulties - and 
as such,  it shouldve  acknowledged that it wouldnt be responsible to provide  Mr B with further 
credit as it was unlikely hed be able to repay it sustainably.
Mr B repaid his Pounds to Pocket instalment  loan just four days after he took it. Five days 
later he returned to QuickQuid for another payday loan (Loan 11). 
Ref: DRN58834605Loan 12 was taken six days after Loan 11 was repaid and was extended  twice. Mr B was also 
charged a late fee. He eventually repaid Loan  12 almost a month later than originally agreed. 
I accept that there  was then a gap of 51 days before he took Loan 13 but in the meantime  
three further defaults had been recorded on his credit file which are likely to have shown  up 
on the credit  check CEN did on 21 October 2018. So I dont  accept that a seven week  break 
in the circumstances  Ive outlined was sufficient for CEN to conclude  that Mr B was in a 
position to repay any further credit sustainably. 
Loan 13 was Mr Bs highest payday loan at £250. And as he was due to repay  it through three 
instalments which were all in November, he was due to repay almost  £330 in that month.  The  
indications  including  his pattern of borrowing and his credit file information  - were that no 
further credit was sustainable for Mr B, let alone  a loan of £250 on these  terms.
I acknowledge that Mr B may not have provided  wholly accurate information about his 
financial situation to CEN but given what  it wouldve found out had it done proportionate 
checks and based on the information it actually  had, including all the history I've outlined and 
the credit file results  I'm currently satisfied that CEN  was wrong to provide further credit to 
Mr B from (and including) Loan 10 on 18 June 2018.
Having thought about everything again  I remain satisfied that CEN  should not have granted 
loans 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and any top-ups on those loans -  as referred to in my table in 
the annex below.
putting things right
With reference to my table in the annex,  this is how I require  CEN  to put things right:
1)refund all interest  and charges Mr B paid to CEN on Loans 6  and 7
2)refund all interest  and charges Mr B paid to CEN on the loans he took from and 
including Loan 10 on 18 June 2018  *
3)pay interest of 8% simple** a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement
4)remove adverse information  from Mr Bs credit file relating to Loans 10, 11 and 12
5)the number of loans  taken by 17 July 2013  (Loan  6 in the first chain) and by 
21 October 2018 (Loan 13 in the second  chain) means any information  recorded 
about loans 6, 7 and 13 is in itself adverse. So all entries about these loans should 
be removed from Mr Bs credit file
* Mr B has provided information showing that he has repaid Loan 13. If that loan has been repaid then 
CEN should  do as I've outlined in 2) above.  But if there is an outstanding balance  on Loan 13 CEN  
should apply  all repayments Mr B made on this loan as though  they were towards the principal sum. If 
Mr B repaid more than the principal sum this will leave  a balance owing  to him. Interest  of 8% simple** a 
year should be applied to that balance owed to Mr B from the date on which the principal balance was 
repaid. The overpayment and interest should be refunded to Mr B
**HM Revenue & Customs  requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN58834606my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above and in my provisional decision I uphold Mr Bs complaint in 
part and require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right in the way I've explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 September 2019.
