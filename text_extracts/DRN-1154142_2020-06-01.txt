The complaint
Miss S complains about the service she received when trying to order a new debit card for 
her National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) current account. Miss S also complains that 
NatWest sent an email containing private information to her mother. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Everyone agrees that NatWest made errors when ordering new cards and PINs for 
Miss S and that the process took too long. In addition, all parties agree that NatWest 
incorrectly emailed Miss S mother with private information. I need to decide whether 
NatWests existing offer to settle Miss S complaint is fair. 
In response to the investigators view Miss S said she did not disagree with the 
outcome of the debit card issue but remained concerned that the settlement she had 
received, after NatWest shared her private information, didnt go far enough. I agree 
that NatWest made a serious mistake when it sent Miss S private information to her 
mother. But NatWest paid Miss S £150 in recognition of its error, sent a gift and 
apologised. Im satisfied that the settlement NatWest has paid fairly reflects the 
impact of its error on Miss S, so Im not telling it to increase the award. 
Overall, I can see there were delays by NatWest and errors when arranging for a 
new debit card to be sent. NatWest resolved the situation by reissuing debit cards 
and ordering a new PIN. I agree the service Miss S received wasnt good enough. 
But, NatWest has paid £141.60 to cover her costs and the inconvenience caused. I 
think thats reasonable. 
Im sorry to disappoint Miss S but I havent been persuaded to tell NatWest to 
increase its offer. I agree that the service provided was poor and its clear NatWest 
acted in error when it sent private information to Miss S mother. But, the debit card 
issues were resolved and NatWest has apologised for the service provided. NatWest 
has also apologised for the email it sent. Im satisfied the compensation NatWest has 
already paid is fair in all the circumstances, so Im not telling it to increase its offer or 
take any further action.  
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint because National Westminster Bank Plc has 
already paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 June 2020.
