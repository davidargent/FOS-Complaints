The complaint
Mr S, on behalf of T, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked Ts 
account card.
What happened
Mr S says he travelled to the United States of America (USA) in February 2020 for a 
business trip. He says he travelled to the USA on 5 February 2020 and booked a return flight 
for 16 February 2020 but planned on amending that return date whilst there. Mr S says he 
paid £3,600 for accommodation until 23 February 2020. He says whilst in the USA he tried to 
pay for a flight for a colleague using Ts account card, but NatWest incorrectly placed on 
block on the account and card due to its mistake in asking an incorrect question. Mr S says 
he was forced to return to the United Kingdom (UK) on 16 February 2020 which meant T lost 
out on important meetings and he would like NatWest to pay compensation of £3,672. He 
says that compensation is made up of all the flights and his total accommodation cost. Mr S 
also complains about how NatWest has dealt with this complaint.
NatWest accepts it made a mistake and has apologised as well as paying T £150 
compensation. It says it asked Mr S for further information about the travel and for his return 
flight details and when it was booked. But didnt receive the answers to its questions. 
Following the complaint being referred to us NatWest has offered to refund the 
accommodation costs from 16 February 2020 until 23 February 2020 and refund the flight 
costs to the UK of £357.31 as well as increase its compensation offer by £200.
Mr S had brought the complaint to us and provided information about the planned meetings. 
Our investigator thought NatWest had acted fairly by apologising and thought its 
compensation offer fair and didnt think it should pay for the cost of any lost contracts.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says he gave NatWest the required information and says 
he paid for the accommodation personally.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has made a fair and 
reasonable compensation offer and I dont require it to increase that offer for the reasons I 
will explain. I also make clear to Mr S that this is a complaint by T and not Mr S. So, I have to 
consider the impact on T and not Mr S. And Im satisfied that I find NatWest was entitled to 
ask Mr S for further information when assessing the claim and didnt receive answers to 
some of its questions. 
There is no question here that NatWest made a mistake and blocked Ts account which 
meant Mr S travelled to the UK to sort matters out. I can see that NatWest has apologised 
and the only real issue for me to consider is the level of compensation. There is no need for 
me to repeat in detail what took place, but I accept there was an impact on T.
Im satisfied that Mr S was able to travel to the USA and was able to use the accommodation 
until his return. So, I cant fairly order that NatWest refund the cost of the flight to the USA or 
for the accommodation that was used.
I appreciate Mr S says he was planning on amending the date of his return from 16 February 
2020, but I think the important issue is that Mr S was planning on returning. So, I dont think 
Mr S or T has paid for a further flight and it follows that I think NatWest has acted fairly by 
offering to refund the return flight cost in circumstances where I dont think T has suffered a 
financial loss. And in circumstances where I dont think NatWest was obliged to make such 
an offer.
I accept that Mr S has provided details of his accommodation cost which clearly shows it had 
been paid up to 23 February 2020. And so, I think NatWest has correctly offered to refund 
the unused part of that cost. I have made clear that I think it would be unfair to order 
NatWest to refund the full accommodation cost where Mr S has had the benefit of part of it. I 
can see Mr S says he paid personally for the accommodation costs not T, but I dont think a 
separate complaint needs to be set up in the light of NatWests offer.
I appreciate Mr S says he had set up meetings which he was unable to attend. But I have no 
way of knowing if those meetings would have resulted in contracts as Mr S suggests they 
would. In those circumstances I cant fairly order NatWest to pay for the cost of any lost 
income and can see that Mr S hasnt been able to say what if any those costs were.
Im satisfied that in addition to offering to refund costs, NatWest has offered what I think is a 
fair and reasonable compensation offer of a further £200. I think that offer fairly reflects the 
inconvenience T has suffered as a result of NatWests mistake.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has made a fair and reasonable compensation offer which I 
think in respect of the return flight was not obliged to make. I appreciate Mr S says he is 
considering other action and so I will leave it to him to decide if he wishes to accept the offer 
on behalf of T. I can see Mr S has been told what the implications are for him in accepting 
the offer and in taking further action.
Putting things right
NatWest has made a fair and reasonable compensation offer of £1,937.56.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has made a fair and reasonable 
compensation offer. Mr Ss acceptance, on behalf of T, of that offer would be in full and final 
settlement of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2021.
