The complaint
Mr L complains that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money (118 118) provided 
him with credit he couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
Mr L says that two loans he was provided with by 118 118 were unaffordable for him. The 
details of the loans are as follows:
Loan 1  approved 30 March 2019 for £1,000 and repayable through 12 equal payments of 
£101.62.
Loan 2  approved on 4 December 2020 for £2,000 and repayable through 24 equal 
payments of £157.77.
Since Mr L has referred his complaint to this service 118 118 have agreed that the first loan 
shouldnt have been provided and was unaffordable for Mr L. But they dont agree that the 
second loan was. Theyve explained that they completed reasonable and proportionate 
checks before approving that loan and that they asked Mr L for details of his income and 
expenditure. Theyve also provided a copy of the credit file they reviewed and, all told, they 
say it was clear that repayments were sustainably affordable for Mr L.
Our investigator agreed with 118 118 about loan 2 but suggested they refund all charges 
and interest that had accrued on the first loan.
As Mr L didnt agree the complaint has been referred to me, an ombudsman, for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable here. 
Theres no dispute here that loan one was unaffordable and 118 118 shouldnt have 
provided it. Ill come back to that later.
I think 118 118 completed proportionate checks before they approved the second loan. They 
asked Mr L about his income and expenditure and they also considered statistical 
information to ensure the expenditure being declared was sufficient. The money being 
loaned wasnt particularly large given Mr Ls stated income and I dont think it would 
therefore be proportionate to expect 118 118 to verify his income or review his bank 
statements. The information it gathered suggested that after loan 2 was taken into account 
Mr L would be repaying about £287 a month towards his credit commitments and having 
taken his income of £1666 and expenditure into account I dont think 118 118 were 
unreasonable to consider the loan affordable.
The credit file didnt show any signs of financial difficulty either. Whilst Mr L had exceeded 
the credit limit on a credit card in the preceding month he had quickly brought that account 
back up to date with a large payment, and he hadnt missed any payments on his credit 
commitments for six months or had any County Court judgements or defaults registered 
against him in recent times.
I dont therefore think there is evidence loan 2 was unaffordable. So, Ill go on to consider 
what action 118 118 should take in relation to the unaffordable first loan.
Putting things right
The first loan was repaid in 2019 but as I dont think 118 118 should have approved that loan 
I dont think its fair for it to charge any interest or charges on it. However, Mr L has had the 
benefit of the capital he lent so I think he should pay that back. 
While I think its fair that Mr Ls credit file is an accurate reflection of his financial history, I 
dont think its fair that he should be disadvantaged by 118 118s decision to lend to him 
irresponsibly. Therefore, I think 118 118 should remove any negative information they have 
recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation to this loan.
118 118 should:
Refund any interest and charges Mr L paid on the first loan and add 8% simple 
interest* per year calculated from the date the overpayments were made until the 
date of settlement). 
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation to this loan
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires the business to deduct tax from this interest. They 
should give the consumer a certificate showing how much tax theyve deducted, if the 
consumer asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put things right in the 
way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2022.
