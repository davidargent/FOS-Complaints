An adjudicator considered  Mr Ps complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt 
think Satsuma shouldve  approved loans 3, 8 or 9. Satsuma didnt respond  to the 
adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Satsuma needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Satsuma should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN12416072refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Satsuma was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) and its predecessor 
(the OFTs  irresponsible lending guidance), defines sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
In common with the adjudicator, I dont think loans 1 and 2 or 4 to 7 were lent irresponsibly. 
There were a number of significant gaps in the chains  of lending  most notably between  
loans 1 and 2 and then between loans 3 and 4. So it wasnt  always that case that Mr P was 
clearly retuning for new loans as soon as he settled  one. Nor were  there  always  signs that 
Mr P was struggling to manage his money or was inappropriately  relying  on short-term credit  
to subsidise expenditure which exceeded  his income.
But for loans 3, 8 and 9 I think proportionate  checks would likely have led Satsuma to decide  
they were not affordable to Mr P. Ill explain why.
Satsuma says it carried out credit checks before lending to Mr P. Ive noted  from Mr Ps 
credit file that at the time of loan 3 he had significant outstanding balances  with around three 
other short-term lenders.  Together these totalled  over £1,000  and at least  two of the loans 
were in arrears, with overdue  payments. Had Satsuma carried  out proportionate  checks into 
Mr Ps existing  credit commitments, I think it wouldve likely been  aware  Mr P was struggling  
to manage his commitments  at this time  and so likely wasnt  in a position  to sustainably 
repay loan 3. In saying  this Ive taken into account  that what  Mr P told Satsuma about his 
income and expenditure suggested  his disposable  income was roughly equal to his existing 
short-term debt  so new debt wouldnt likely be affordable at this time.  As I think  Satsuma 
ought reasonably  to have realised loan 3 wouldnt  be sustainably affordable, I dont think it 
shouldve approved it.
From September 2016 onwards Mr P was regularly  accessing Satsumas short-term loans. 
Loan 6 was taken out just three days after Mr P repaid loan 5 and loan 7 just one day after 
loan 6 was repaid. Loan 8 was then taken out before  loan 7 was repaid  and Mr P borrowed 
twice as much.
By the time of loan 8 I think Satsuma shouldve realised, from the pattern of consecutive 
borrowing, that Mr P was again likely  to have been struggling to manage  his money and that 
there was a significant risk he wouldnt be able to sustainably repay this new loan. I think the 
Ref: DRN12416073same applies  to loan 9, which was also taken out before Mr P repaid loans 7 and 8. Given  
the pattern  of borrowing, I think Satsuma ought to have realised it was likely Mr P was 
having to keep borrowing to plug a systematic  hole in his finances   which isnt a sustainable 
situation.
I also think it was unfair  for Satsuma  to continue approving loans  after loan 7. It had the 
effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness with it by allowing him to take expensive 
credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
Im therefore  also upholding the complaint about  loans  8 and 9.
putting things right
Satsuma should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr P paid on loans  3 and 9
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr P paid the interest 
and charges until the date of settlement
remove adverse information about loans 3 and 9 from Mr Ps credit  history
I understand theres still an outstanding  balance on loan 8. Satsuma  should  therefore rework 
the balance of loan 8 to remove  all interest  and charges  and treat any payments made as if 
they were payments towards the principal. It can then deduct what  it owes  Mr P (for loan 3 
and 9) from this balance   but only if it still owns the debt.  Satsuma  should  also remove 
adverse information  about loan 8 but it doesnt have to do this until the loan is repaid.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest. Satsuma must give 
Mr P a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Ps complaint in part. Provident Personal  Credit 
Limited must  put things right by taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 September 2019.
