The complaint
Mr J complains that Chetwood Financial Limited (trading as BetterBorrow) was irresponsible 
to lend to him.
What happened
Mr J had two loans from BetterBorrow in January 2022 and May 2022 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 26 Jan 2022 £9,500 24m £481.44 20 Jan 2024 22 Feb 2022
2 26 May 2022 £5,000 24m £274.60 20 May 2024 1 Sep 2022
Mr J says BetterBorrow agreed to lend to him, even though other companies turned him 
down at the time. He says his expenditure exceeded his income and he had other loans and 
credit cards to repay. Mr J says he had to borrow again to repay the loans.
BetterBorrow says Mr J declared his income and expenditure and it carried out checks with 
the credit reference agencies. It says it was confident that the lending was affordable.
Our investigator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. She wasnt satisfied 
that BetterBorrow had carried out proportionate checks for either loan, but considered it had 
enough information to show loan 1 was likely to be unsustainable. However, she found that 
had BetterBorrow conducted proportionate checks for loan 2, it was likely it would still have 
approved that loan. Our investigator recommended that any repayments over the loan 1 
amount should be refunded with 8% interest and any negative information about loan 1 
should be removed from Mr Js credit file.
Mr J responded initially to say that he did not agree with the investigators calculations for his 
expenditure for loan 2, but subsequently accepted her recommendations.
BetterBorrow responded to say, in summary, that its calculations showed Mr J had sufficient 
disposable income to afford the repayments on loan 1.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
Bearing this in mind, in coming to a decision on Mr Js case, I have considered the following 
questions:
Did BetterBorrow complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing 
Mr Js loan applications to satisfy itself that he would be able to repay the loans in a 
sustainable way? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did BetterBorrow make a fair lending decision?
Did BetterBorrow act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Loan 1
When Mr J applied for the loan, Ive seen evidence to show BetterBorrow asked him about 
his income and housing costs and also checked his credit file. I can see that BetterBorrow 
also verified the declared income. However, based on the information it received, Im not 
satisfied the checks went far enough. I say that because:
The loan was for two years and BetterBorrow needed to be confident that the 
repayments were sustainable over that period;
Mr J was already committed to spending around 27% of his income on credit 
repayments;
His two existing loans were both taken out within the last six months and a credit 
card was taken out within the last three months;
BetterBorrow used an estimate for Mr Js regular expenditure based on statistical 
averages;
I consider that, given the term of the loan and the relatively high level of new, existing credit, 
compared with Mr Js income, BetterBorrow needed to have a full understanding of his 
financial circumstances.
As such Ive looked at Mr Js bank statements from the time as a reasonable proxy for what 
BetterBorrow may have seen had it carried out proportionate checks. They show:
Mr Js income was roughly in line with the £2,825 hed declared;
Mr J contributed around £900 per month to cover his share of the rent, energy bills, 
council tax, TV licence and gym membership;
As well as the credit commitments, Mr J was also paying for broadband, a mobile 
phone, water and life insurance totalling over £170 in the month before the lending;
There was also a regular payment to his partner each month to cover his share of 
childcare. That was £750 in December 2021.
Including the £750 of existing credit commitments, Mr J was left with around £250 of 
disposable income each month and so Im satisfied he could not afford a further loan 
repayment of £481.
Therefore, I find BetterBorrow would have made a different lending decision had it carried 
out proportionate checks and I uphold Mr Js complaint about loan 1.Loan 2
As both Mr J and BetterBorrow agreed with the investigators findings on loan 2 I wont 
consider it further here.
In summary, based on all the evidence, I find BetterBorrow did not make a fair lending 
decision for loan 1, although I cant see it acted unfairly in any other way.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Chetwood Financial Limited (trading as 
BetterBorrow) should: 
Add up the total amount of money Mr J received as a result of having been given 
loan 1. The repayments Mr J made should be deducted from this amount and the 
overpayments should then be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated 
from the date the overpayments were made until the settlement date); *
Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Js credit file regarding loan 1.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires BetterBorrow to take off tax from this interest. 
BetterBorrow must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2023.
