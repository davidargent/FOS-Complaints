The complaint
Miss C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly allowed her to 
take out a loan which was unaffordable.
What happened
Miss C says she applied for the NatWest loan in branch in March 2019 for just under 
£15,000. She says she was the victim of a fraud and told to tell NatWest she needed the 
loan for a vehicle or for home improvements. Miss C says in any event the loan was 
unaffordable and NatWest didnt carry out appropriate checks. She says she told NatWest 
that part of her income was made up of benefits that would shortly stop when her children 
reached a certain age.
NatWest says Miss C declared an income of about £1,345 a month and was in employment. 
It says it did carry out appropriate checks and calculated her expenditure. NatWest says it 
has no record of being told about the change in Miss Cs future income position.
Miss C brought her complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought NatWest had carried out appropriate checks on the loan application and 
couldnt fairly conclude NatWest had been told about the income reduction. 
Miss C doesnt accept that view and question why the investigator is accepting what 
NatWest says about the change in income.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Miss C will be disappointed by my decision.
Lenders must carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any lending application. 
Those checks will of course vary depending on the amount and type of that lending.
I can see from NatWests records that Miss C applied for the loan for just under £15,000 in 
March 2019. I can see that NatWest checked Miss Cs income and also carried out checks 
on her outgoings as well as on her credit file. Im satisfied that Miss C had on the face of it 
income in excess of her outgoings and I have not seen any adverse information on her credit 
file at the time of lending. So, Im satisfied that NatWest did carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks on Miss Cs loan applications and that the lending was affordable and 
so not irresponsible.
I appreciate Miss C says she was a fraud victim and told to tell NatWest that the loan was for 
a vehicle or home repairs. And I appreciate Miss C says she told NatWest about the 
forthcoming reduction in her income. I cant be sure in these circumstances that NatWest 
was told about that reduction as it doesnt have a record of being told that and I think it 
unlikely that NatWest would have ignored that information having obtained evidence of that 
part of Miss Cs income. I also have to consider the position Miss C was in and that at the 
time of the lending she was unaware she was dealing with a fraudster. I think on balance it 
unlikely that Miss C would have told NatWest about that income reduction as that may have 
jeopardised the loan, which I think at the time she wouldnt have wanted to do.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest did carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on Miss 
Cs loan application. I dont think it possible to be entirely sure what was said about the 
potential income reduction, so I have consider what I think on balance more likely to have 
taken place.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 September 2021.
