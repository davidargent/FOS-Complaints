K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender)  was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
background
Mr A had two instalment  loans from Mr Lender between April 2017  and September  2017 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Max Repayment Repaid
1 20 Apr 2017 £500 6m 31 Oct 2017 £247.33 4 Sep 2017
2 4 Sep 2017 £750 6m 28 Feb 2018 £285.00 Outstanding
Mr A says his expenditure exceeded  his monthly  income each month so there was no way 
he could afford additional  loan repayments. He says that he was having  to borrow  again 
each time he made a repayment and that his debt problems were getting worse  as a result. 
Mr A says Mr Lender should  have  seen he was in financial difficulties from looking at his 
credit report.
Mr Lender says it asked Mr A about his income and expenditure and found he had sufficient 
disposable income to easily cover  the highest  repayment. Mr Lender added that it also 
checked Mr As credit  file and considered  him to be a credit worthy customer. It says that 
when Mr A told it that his financial  circumstances had changed, it agreed a repayment  plan 
on loan 2, and has now offered to set up a further plan given Mr As more recent 
circumstances.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He considered  Mr 
Lender did enough checks before approving the loans and didnt think  Mr Lender  was wrong 
to conclude the loans were affordable.
Mr A responded to say that hed like an ombudsman  to reconsider the complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make  sure Mr A 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr A was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Loan 1
When Mr A applied  for his first loan, he told Mr Lender his income was £2,200 and that his 
monthly expenditure was £1,536. Mr Lender  also checked his credit file and, based  on the 
results of that, and Mr As calculated disposable  income, it approved the loan. As the highest 
repayment on this loan was a relatively  small proportion of Mr As declared income, I cant 
conclude Mr Lender should have carried out any further checks, nor that it was wrong to find 
the loan affordable.

Mr A repaid  his first loan early, on 4 Sep 2017, and applied for loan 2 the same day. The 
maximum repayment due on this loan was £285.  Mr A said his financial circumstances 
hadnt changed since loan 1 and his declared  disposable income remained at £664.  As a 
result of this, and Mr As repayment record, Im satisfied there was nothing  that indicated  to 
Mr Lender it needed  to do additional  checks before approving  this loan.
 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 April 2019.
