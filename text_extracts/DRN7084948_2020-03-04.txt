K821x#15complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 65 loans Sunny provided to Mr C between  August 2015 and 
September 2018. Sunny have already  agreed to uphold Mr Cs complaint about  loans 14 
onwards, so I havent considered these  further in my decision. Ive attached  a table at the 
end of my decision setting out some of the information about  loans 1  13. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint about loans 4 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Mr C disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
Ref: DRN70849482difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.  Our adjudicator  didnt uphold Mr Cs 
complaint about  loans  1  3, and Mr C hasnt  responded  to say he doesnt agree with this 
opinion. So as these  loans are no longer in dispute,  I havent considered these  loans further. 
But I have kept them in mind when looking at Mr Cs overall lending  relationship with Sunny.  
Sunny has told us that before agreeing to lend Mr C any of the loans it enquired about his 
income and expenses at the time to check if the loans were affordable for him. But our 
adjudicator felt, and I agree, that by loan 4 Sunny shouldve carried  out more thorough 
checks of Mr Cs financial situation.
Had Sunny  completed  a full review of Mr Cs financial situation and considered what it 
already knew about Mr Cs lending history with it, it most likely wouldve uncovered that Mr C 
had several other short-term loans running at the same time with other  providers. And that 
he had loans 1 and 2 still outstanding at the time he applied for loan 4. Loan 4 was also 
requested for a larger amount  than loans 2 and 3. Together this evidence suggests that Mr C 
was not managing his finances  well and was unlikely to be able to pay back this loan. So 
overall, a properly carried our affordability assessment was likely to lead to a responsible  
lender to conclude  that the loan  or any subsequent  ones - was not affordable for an 
applicant in that situation. So I am upholding loans 4 and 5 on this basis.   
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out five loans within six months  and had been indebted 
to Sunny for the entire time. So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more likely than 
not Mr C was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Cs first loan was for £800 and loan 6 was for £550. At this point Sunny ought to 
have realised that Mr C was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr C had taken 
out 65 loans in just over three  years, and many  of these loans were for sums  over 
£300. So, Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN70849483Sunny responded to the adjudicators decision stating that Mr C repaid all his loans early, so 
it doesnt agree that Mr C was struggling.  It also said that Mr Cs loans varied  from £950  to 
as little as £50, so it says that no pattern of borrowing  had emerged,  and Mr C was 
borrowing dependent on his needs  at the time. 
Even though  Mr C had repaid his loans  early, he often had other loans with Sunny running at 
the same  and took out an additional  loan shortly after repaying one. So even though he was 
repaying his loans early, this isnt enough  to suggest Mr C wasnt reliant on short-term  loans 
or that he wasnt having trouble managing his money. Ive also thought  about  the fact that 
some of Mr Cs loans  were for small amounts  as low as £50, but these were all running 
alongside other, larger Sunny loans  so again this doesnt mean  Mr C wasnt in financial 
difficulty.  
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 4 - 65;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Cs credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans 6  65 should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited put things right as outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
