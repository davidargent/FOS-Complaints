The complaint
Miss S complains that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly by granting her a credit card and 
increasing her credit limit several times. She says the lending was unaffordable for her.
What happened
In January 2017, Miss S applied for a credit card with NewDay. Her application was 
accepted with an initial credit limit of £600. The credit limit increased four times over the next 
two years. By December 2018, the limit was £5,550.
In 2020, Miss S complained to NewDay that it had lent to her irresponsibly. NewDay said it 
had carried out an affordability check before approving the credit. It had also assessed 
affordability each time the increases were offered. It said Miss S was given the opportunity to 
opt-out before the credit limit increases but she didnt do so. 
Miss S remained unhappy, so she brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator 
thought NewDays decision to approve Miss Ss initial credit card application was 
reasonable. But she thought NewDay had acted irresponsibly by increasing the credit limits. 
She said information from the credit checks NewDay had carried out indicated Miss S might 
have been experiencing financial difficulty. She also referred to Miss S using the card to 
withdraw cash and said this suggested Miss S didnt have enough to live on. 
NewDay disagreed with our investigators view. It said that although indicators of financial 
difficulty were reported by a credit reference agency, these didnt appear at the times the 
credit limit increases took place. Miss Ss cash withdrawals were in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account. She didnt need to withdraw cash to pay for food and other 
general expenses as she could have used her card. NewDay said Miss S mostly managed 
her credit card account well. It was satisfied the credit limit increases went ahead after 
reasonable and proportionate checks were completed.
I issued a provisional decision on 13 October 2021 where I explained why I intended to 
uphold Miss Ss complaint. In that decision I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Based on what Ive seen so far, I intend to uphold Miss Ss complaint in part. Ill explain why.
The relevant rules, regulations and guidance required NewDay to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Miss S would be able to afford to make the repayments in a 
sustainable manner. 
The checks needed to be borrower-focused. It wasnt enough for NewDay to think only about 
the likelihood of getting its money back. It also had to ensure that she was in a position to 
repay what she borrowed in a reasonable period of time, without undue difficulty (for 
example by getting into further debt).
There isnt a set list of checks that lenders need to carry out, but they should be 
proportionate, taking a number of factors into consideration. These factors include the 
amount, type and cost of the credit as well as the personal circumstances of the consumer.
Initial decision to provide the credit card
When Miss S applied for the credit card, she was asked some questions about her 
residential status and employment. Miss S said she was employed with an annual income of 
£30,000 and other household income of £15,000. She said she had a mortgage balance of 
£137,000 and unsecured debt of £1,700. 
NewDay also gathered some information from credit reference agencies. It says there was 
no payday loan information available at the time and the most recent default was 36 months 
before the application.
 
Given NewDay was initially only agreeing to lend Miss S £600, I think its checks were 
proportionate and the lending appeared to be affordable.
First credit limit increase 
In June 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Ss card from £600 to £1,500. 
NewDay says it reviewed Miss Ss account before offering the increase and this would have 
involved looking at how she was using her account and managing other credit commitments.
Our investigator didnt think NewDay should have granted the increase because a financial 
difficulty indicator was showing on the credit reference agency data NewDay has provided 
for May 2017. But NewDay says that this wouldnt have appeared until the end of the month, 
meaning that it wouldnt have been showing when if offered the credit limit increase to     
Miss S on 4 May 2017 and it was gone by the time the increase took place. 
Our investigator was also concerned that Miss S had used her NewDay credit card to 
withdraw cash in May 2017. But the amount withdrawn was only £20, so I dont think this 
alone was enough to suggest Miss S was in financial difficulty.
The information NewDay has provided shows that Miss S kept well within her £600 credit 
limit, prior to the increase and was paying her balance in full each month. 
I dont think the checks NewDay carried out should have given it reason to believe the 
further lending was unaffordable. But Im not persuaded the checks were proportionate, 
given it was more than doubling the credit limit on the card. 
Miss S has provided us with a copy of her credit file, and Ive reviewed this to see if theres 
anything else NewDay should have been aware of at the time. From what I can see, Miss S 
had three other credit cards with a total limit of £2,650. The credit increase on the NewDay 
card brought her total available credit up to £4,150. It looks like Miss S was keeping up to 
date with her repayments. Aside from Miss Ss mortgage of £514 a month, I cant see that 
she had any other credit commitments at that time. So, I think that further proportionate 
checks would likely have suggested that the increase in lending was affordable. 
From what Ive seen, I think NewDays decision to increase Miss Ss credit limit in June 2017 
was reasonable.
 
Second and subsequent credit limit increases
In November 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Ss card to £2,900. This was a significant increase to almost six times what it was when the credit card was first 
granted. So, NewDay needed to carry out further checks to understand whether Miss S 
could sustainably repay a balance of £2,900 within a reasonable period of time. 
NewDay says it reviewed Miss Ss account before offering the increase and this would have 
involved looking at how she was using her account and managing other credit commitments. 
NewDay has provided us with a spreadsheet of data, which gives some information about 
Miss Ss usage of the card (balance, payments, retail spending, cash spending etc) as well 
as her overall debt (including her mortgage). Given the amount of credit NewDay was 
considering extending to Miss S, I dont think the checks it carried out were proportionate. 
So, Ive gone on to consider what NewDay would likely have seen if it had carried out further 
checks. 
Miss Ss credit file shows shed taken two more credit cards since the previous credit limit 
increase, giving her a total of six. These gave her available credit over £10,000 with the 
increased NewDay limit. Miss S had also taken out a loan in September 2017 which required 
her to pay £190 a month for 36 months. 
Miss S says she was made redundant in around January 2017. She returned to the same 
employment in May 2017, but her hours and pay were lower than theyd previously been. 
Miss S says shed experienced financial difficulty from the time she was unemployed. Part of 
the reason for taking out the loan in September 2017, was to pay back money shed 
borrowed from family members. 
I think that if NewDay had carried out proportionate checks in November 2017, it ought to 
have concluded that Miss S would be unlikely to sustainably repay a balance of £2,900 
within a reasonable period of time, given her income and existing credit commitments. So, I 
dont think NewDays decision to increase Miss Ss credit limit was responsible. 
NewDay also doesnt appear to have carried out proportionate checks when it subsequently 
increased Miss Ss credit limit in June and November 2018, and it doesnt look like her 
financial circumstances had improved. So, I think these further credit limit increases were 
also given irresponsibly. 
I set out what I intended to direct NewDay to do to put things right. And I gave both parties 
the opportunity to send me any further information or comments they wanted me to consider 
before I issued my final decision.
Responses
Miss S said she had no other information to provide and was happy to agree to my findings.
NewDay agreed that the increase in November 2018 should not have taken place. But it said 
it remained of the opinion that the credit limit increases that took place in November 2017 
and June 2018 were completed after reasonable and proportionate checks were conducted. 
NewDay said that, since July 2021, Miss S has been on a payment arrangement for £5 a 
month, which is less than her minimum contractual payment. Since she entered the reduced 
payment arrangement, late payment markers have been recorded on her credit file. NewDay 
said it is required to report how an account is managed accurately so it wasnt prepared to 
remove the late payment markers. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay maintains that the checks it carried out before the credit limit increases that took 
place in November 2017 and June 2018 were reasonable and proportionate. But in 
November 2017 the credit limit increased to almost double what it was previously and almost 
six times the original limit. This was a significant increase which meant that NewDay was 
required to undertake an assessment of Miss Ss creditworthiness and the rules say it must 
be based on sufficient information. 
I explained in my provisional decision, why I didnt think NewDays checks were sufficient. I 
also referred to information on Miss Ss credit file which indicated that she would be unlikely 
to be able to sustainably repay a balance of £2,900 within a reasonable period of time. 
NewDay says it isnt prepared to remove late payment markers from Miss Ss credit file from 
the reduced payment arrangement. I appreciate that NewDay has an obligation to report 
accurate information about how an account is managed. But I think NewDays decision to 
increase Miss Ss credit limit to a level that was unaffordable is likely to have contributed to 
her being in financial difficulty. If it hadnt done so its likely she wouldnt have found herself 
in the position of being unable to meet her contractual repayments. So, I think it would be fair 
for NewDay to remove the late payment markers from the credit file.
 
Having considered NewDays comments, I havent found reason to change the conclusions I 
reached in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
Miss S has had the benefit of the funds she borrowed, so I think its fair that she repays 
them. But shes incurred additional interest and charges as a result of NewDay lending to 
her irresponsibly. So, NewDay should:
Refund all interest and charges incurred on a balance above £1,500 to Miss Ss 
account. 
If these refunds result in the account having a credit balance, NewDay must pay this 
to Miss S along with 8% simple interest per year* from the date the credit balance 
arose to the date of settlement.
If an outstanding balance remains on the account after the adjustments have been 
made, NewDay should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree a suitable 
repayment plan with Miss S.  
Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ss credit file relating to the 
account after the credit limit increase in November 2017.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from this interest. NewDay should give  
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for one. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Ss complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put 
things right by doing as Ive said above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 December 2021.
