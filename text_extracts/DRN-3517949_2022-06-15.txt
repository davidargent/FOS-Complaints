The complaint
Mr M complains about three loans provided to him by Madison CF UK Limited, trading as
118 118 Money, (118 118), which he says were unaffordable. The complaint is brought to 
this service on Mr Ms behalf by a claims management company. But for ease, I shall refer 
below to all actions being taken by Mr M.
What happened
118 118 agreed three loans for Mr M. Some of the information 118 118 provided about the 
loans is shown in the table below.

3. 3/12/2020 14/10/2021 £1,000 12 monthly repayments of 
£118.5612
Mr M says that he got into debt from the loans and suffered financial hardship as a result. 
In its final response letter, 118 118 said that it had asked Mr M for information about his 
income and expenditure, the reasons for the loans and about his employment. It said that it 
had used industry standard verification checks to validate this information. It was satisfied 
that it had acted correctly in approving the loan applications.
Our investigators view
 
Our investigator recommended that the complaint about Loans 2 and 3 should be upheld. He 
said with regard to Loan 1 that the checks which 118 118 completed prior to the approval of 
this loan, should have reasonably made the lender aware that Mr M was exhibiting signs of 
financial difficulty. He believed that there were unanswered questions about Mr Ms 
circumstances that needed answers to ensure that Mr M could repay the borrowing 
sustainably. But having considered all information available to him, he hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that Loan 1 was unaffordable to Mr M at the time.
With regard to Loan 2, the investigator said that based on the evidence that was available to 
118 118, it should have reasonably concluded that Mr Ms overall pattern of borrowing 
suggested that he had become persistently reliant on credit. He said this because the 
amounts Mr M was borrowing stayed roughly the same and because he was repeatedly 
coming back for new loans. So, Mr Ms overall borrowing pattern indicated that the loans 
from here were unsustainable and he didnt think 118 118 should have given Mr M Loans 2 
and 3.
118 118 disagreed with the investigators view with regard to Loans 2 and 3. It said that it did 
not feel that the credit files for Loans 2 and 3 painted a picture of someone who was 
struggling with their finances. The total debt balances remained relatively low in the months 
leading up to both loans and there was no information recorded that would have caused 
concern.
As this complaint hadnt been resolved informally, it was passed to me, as an ombudsman, 
to review and resolve. 
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr M
and to 118 118 on 27 May 2022. I summarise my findings:
Id noted that when 118 118 lent to Mr M the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority 
and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook. 
I said that 118 118 would be aware of the relevant regulations and how we considered 
irresponsible lending complaints, so I didnt go into detail on these points. I summarised by 
saying that it needed to check that Mr M could afford to meet his repayments without 
difficulty before agreeing credit for him. In other words, it needed to check he could make his 
repayments out of his usual income without having to borrow to meet them, while meeting 
his existing obligations and without the payments having a significant adverse impact on his 
financial situation. The assessments needed to take into account the nature of the credit and 
Mr Ms circumstances. 
With this in mind, my main consideration was whether 118 118 treated Mr M fairly when it 
agreed to lend to him. Id thought about whether 118 118 had completed reasonable and 
proportionate checks when assessing his applications to satisfy itself that he would be able 
to make his repayments without experiencing adverse consequences. Id thought about the 
information it knew, and what it ought reasonably to have known. 
Loan 1
Loan 1 was for £2,000. The interest rate was 71.3%, (99.9% APR). If Mr M made each 
payment when it was due, hed pay £3,696.48 in total. Mr M repaid Loan 1 in October 2019.
Id noted that 118 118 had gathered some information from Mr M about his income and 
expenditure. It had also carried out a credit check. 
Mr M told 118 118 he was single and was living with his parents. Hed declared his net 
monthly income as £1,333. He said his living costs were £440 and his card and loan 
payments were £500. But 118 118 ought to have been aware from its credit checks that      
Mr Ms monthly credit commitments would have exceeded £500. Id calculated them to be 
around £800. I thought this suggested further verification was needed bearing in mind the 
term of the loan, the cost of the credit, and what 118 118 saw or ought to have seen in the 
information it gathered. 
Id also noted that 118 118 didnt ask Mr M for payslips or bank statements to verify his 
income and expenditure but relied on an income verification tool from a credit reference 
agency. I hadnt seen the results of its income verification so couldnt say if this was 
accurate.
Id reviewed 118 118s credit checks. Id noted that these showed that Mr M had 12 active 
credit accounts and that 14 accounts had been opened in the previous six months. His total 
credit balance was £3,330.I thought the results of 118 118s credit checks ought to have caused it significant concerns 
as they suggested that Mr M was struggling to manage his money as shown especially by 
his regular use of short term loans. I could see that Mr M had been borrowing short term 
loans every month from May 2018 to December 2018. The credit checks didnt show any 
records from January 2019 (although Id noted from 118 118s credit checks for Loan 2 that 
Mr M did take out a short term loan in January 2019 for £350). The checks showed that 
during those eight months Mr M had borrowed around £6,060, an average of £757 each 
month. The loans were often taken out shortly after the previous loan was repaid. This 
suggested that Mr M was borrowing to fill a hole in his finances that was made by repaying 
his previous loan. Id said that this wasnt a sustainable form of borrowing. As the checks 
showed that Mr M had taken out around 17 short term loans in around eight months, I 
thought this suggested that Mr M was facing serious problems managing his money. As     
Mr M was borrowing a significant amount of short term loans just to fund his existing 
expenditure and credit commitments, I thought there was a very real prospect that he would 
need to borrow again in order to repay Loan 1 and that would likely have a significant 
adverse effect on his financial situation. 
I could also see on the credit checks that Mr M had borrowed a large number of short term 
loans in 2016 and 2017.
Id also noted that Mr M had one credit card with an outstanding balance of £195 which was 
very near the cards credit limit of £200. Id noted that there had been arrears on the credit 
card eight months prior to the loan application and the card balance had exceeded its credit 
limit four months prior to the application and the balance was within £5 of the credit limit in 
the next three months.
I thought 118 118 would also likely have been aware that its credit checks might not have 
revealed the full extent of Mr Ms credit commitments A lender might only see a small portion 
of a borrowers credit file, or some data might be missing or anonymised. Its checks might 
not necessarily be up to date. Also, not all lenders reported to the same credit reference 
agencies.
Overall, I thought the results of its credit checks ought to have caused 118 118 concerns as I 
thought they suggested that Mr M was struggling to manage his money as shown especially 
by his frequent use of and apparent reliance on short term loans. At the very least I would 
have reasonably expected 118 118 to have taken steps to verify Mr Ms income and actual 
monthly expenditure to gain a more thorough understanding of his financial position in order 
to satisfy itself that he could repay the loan without the repayments having an adverse effect 
on his financial situation. 118 118 didnt say that it took steps to do this.
Whilst Mr M had told 118 118 that he would be using the loan proceeds to consolidate debt, I 
couldnt see from the information received from 118 118 that it had made this a condition of 
the loan. So, it couldnt be sure that the loans would be paid off. And Mr M would still have 
been left with some debt to repay even if he did repay some of his debts with the loan 
proceeds. 
I could also see that even if Mr M used the proceeds of Loan 1 for debt consolidation, his 
total indebtedness was still increasing. He said he was using a loan of £2,000 to repay debt, 
but he would need around £3,700 to repay Loan 1.
So even though Loan 1 was for debt consolidation, I thought Mr Ms relatively high amount of 
short term borrowing would have suggested that he was having serious problems managing 
his finances that a debt consolidation wouldnt have solved. Mr Ms finances werent stable, 
and overall, I didnt think that further checks would have provided the assurance 118 118 needed. I also thought 118 118 ought reasonably to have realised that it was unlikely that   
Mr M wouldve been able to repay his loan without him having to borrow to meet the 
repayments, without him failing to make any other repayment he had a contractual or 
statutory duty to make, and without the repayments having a significant adverse effect on his 
financial situation. 
I could also see from 118 118s credit checks on Loan 2 that Mr M continued to borrow from 
short term lenders in the months following Loan 1, and I thought this was foreseeable. Id 
noted that within three weeks of taking out Loan 1, Mr M had taken out another two short 
term loans totalling £250. 
So, I thought 118 118 had made an unfair lending decision when it agreed to lend Loan 1 to     
Mr M. And, subject to any further representations by Mr M or 118 118, I intended to uphold 
Mr Ms complaint about Loan 1. 
 
Loan 2
Id noted that Loan 2 was taken out around three and a half months after Loan 1 was repaid 
and Mr M again borrowed £2,000. I thought Mr Ms need for further credit just a few months 
after repaying Loan 1 might have caused 118 118 concerns. The interest rate was 71.3%, 
(99.9% APR). If Mr M made each payment when it was due, hed pay £3,901.92 in total.    
Mr M repaid the loan in March 2020, less than two months after taking it out.
Id noted that 118 118 had gathered some information from Mr M about his income and 
expenditure. It had also carried out a credit check. 
Mr M again told 118 118 he was single and was living with his parents. Hed declared his net 
monthly income as £1,600. He said his living costs were £555 and his card and loan 
payments were £100. 
Id reviewed 118 118s credit checks. Id noted that the checks showed that Mr M had seven 
active credit accounts. I could see that Mr Ms overall credit balance had reduced slightly to 
£3,295. But the checks also suggested that Mr M had continued to be reliant on short term 
and other loans. I could see on the checks that Mr M had taken out short term and other 
loans every month from January 2019 to December 2019 (except September 2019 and 
October 2019 although 118 118s credit checks for Loan 3 showed that Mr M had taken out 
a loan for £5,000 in October 2019). Since November 2019, Mr M had borrowed three loans 
totalling £2,561. 
Id said that simply performing credit checks wasnt enough. A lender needed to react 
appropriately to the information that any checks showed. I thought 118 118s credit checks 
suggested that Mr M was still facing significant financial pressures.
Altogether I thought Mr Ms apparent continued reliance on short term and other loans that   
118 118 ought to have seen on its checks should have put 118 118 on notice that Mr M was 
still having serious problems managing his money. And I didnt think it could be confident 
that Mr M would be able to repay Loan 2 without having to borrow to meet his repayments. 
So, I didnt think 118 118 had made a fair lending decision to provide Loan 2 to him based 
on what it had already seen in its checks. Agreeing further credit for Mr M was only likely to 
add to his financial difficulties. 
Loan 3
Id noted that Loan 3 was taken out around nine months after Loan 2 was repaid and Mr M  
borrowed £1,000. I thought Mr Ms need to borrow further credit again might have caused     118 118 concern. The interest rate was 71.3%, (99.9% APR). If Mr M made each payment 
when it was due, hed pay £1,422.72 in total. Mr M repaid the loan in October 2021.
Id noted that 118 118 again gathered some information from Mr M about his income and 
expenditure. It had also carried out a credit check. 
Mr M again told 118 118 he was single and was living with his parents. Hed declared his net 
monthly income as £1,600. He said his living costs were £640 and he had no card and loan 
payments. But again, 118 118 ought to have been aware from its credit checks that Mr Ms 
monthly credit commitments would have likely exceeded £200. So, I thought it ought to have 
been concerned about the accuracy of Mr Ms declared expenditure.
Id reviewed 118 118s credit checks. Id noted that the checks showed that Mr M had eight 
active credit accounts. I could see that Mr Ms overall credit balance had increased to 
£8,008. But this was largely made up of one large loan taken out in October 2019, two credit 
cards, a mail order account and two telecommunications loans. Whilst I couldnt see that    
Mr M had taken out any loans (other than telecommunications loans) since Loan 2, I thought 
118 118 might have been concerned that the balances on the two credit cards were 
approaching their respective credit limits.
I also didnt think it was reasonable for 118 118 to rely on the expenditure Mr M declared 
especially as 118 118 would have likely known from its credit checks that Mr M hadnt 
declared all his credit commitments to it. 118 118s affordability assessment wasnt tailored 
to Mr M and I thought it should have been in his circumstances. I also thought 118 118 ought 
reasonably to have questioned why Mr M, who appeared to have a disposable income of 
around £900 based on the amounts hed declared, would need to take out an expensive loan 
for £1,000. This seemed unlikely if his monthly disposable income was around £900.  Mr M 
was again entering into a significant commitment with 118 118. Loan 3 was his third loan 
from it in less than two years. Mr M would need to make monthly repayments of around £118 
for 12 months. Altogether, I didnt think its checks were sufficient for 118 118 to get a clear 
picture of Mr Ms finances at the time. And in view of Mr Ms past credit history, I thought it 
would have been proportionate for 118 118 to independently check the true state of Mr Ms 
finances before agreeing the loan. 
118 118 needed to do more than just ascertain whether the loan repayments were 
technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. It could have done this by, 
for example, requesting bank statements from Mr M, asking for copies of  bills and/or 
receipts for his expenses and by asking him for more information about his existing credit 
commitments. I couldnt see that 118 118 took steps to do this. 
But although I thought 118 118 should have asked for some additional information before 
agreeing the loan, that in itself didnt mean that Mr Ms complaint should succeed. I also 
needed to be persuaded that any further information would have shown 118 118 that Mr M 
couldnt sustainably afford the repayments.
Id noted that the investigator had asked to see Mr Ms bank statements from around the 
time of Loan 3. But despite his request, Mr M hadnt provided us with copies of these. So, I 
wasnt able to get a picture of what his financial situation was like at the relevant time. That 
meant I couldnt say that, if 118 118 had completed further checks, it wouldve found that   
Mr M couldnt afford to repay Loan 3. 
So, based on the information Id seen, I wasnt able to conclude that 118 118 shouldnt have 
agreed to provide Loan 3 to Mr M. Id said that if Mr M was able to provide us with the 
relevant copies of his bank statements, I would reconsider my decision. But subject to any further representations by Mr M or 118 118, I didnt intend to say that Mr Ms complaint about 
Loan 3 should be upheld.
So, for the reasons set out above, I didnt think 118 118 had acted fairly when it provided 
Loans 1 and 2 to Mr M. And subject to any further representations by Mr M or 118 118, I 
intended to say that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld in part, and that 118 118 should put 
things right as follows: 
Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to do
118 118 should:
1. Refund all the interest and charges Mr M paid on Loans 1 and 2;
2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*; and
3. Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to 
Loans 1 and 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one. 
Mr M responded to my provisional decision to say that he accepted it.
118 118 responded to my provisional decision to say that it accepted it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry
practice at the time.
Given that Mr M and 118 118 have both accepted my provisional decision and have given 
me nothing further to consider, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in 
my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold this complaint in part and require 118 118 to 
take the steps set out above under the heading Putting things right - what 118 118 needs to 
do.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, to put things right as 
Ive set out above under the heading Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2022.
