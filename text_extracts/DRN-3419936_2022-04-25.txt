The complaint
Mr J complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and the service they provided after he 
raised a dispute about a transaction hed made through his account for an item he didnt 
receive.
What happened
Mr J held a PayPal credit account, which he used to make a purchase of £13.96 in February 
2021. But Mr J says he didnt receive the item hed paid for. So, on 26 April, Mr J raised a 
dispute with PayPal, under the terms of the accounts user agreement.
PayPal requested information from the seller Mr J purchased the item from, as part of their 
dispute process. And they made Mr J aware the seller had until 7 May to respond to their 
request. Mr J was unhappy with this, so he contacted our service.
While Mr Js complaint was with our service, PayPal refunded Mr J the £13.96 on 7 May, 
after the seller didnt respond. But Mr J wasnt happy with this. He explained he was 
unhappy with the service PayPal had provided him. And he didnt think the refund PayPal 
provided considered the interest hed been charged. So, he wanted to be compensated for 
the upset hed been caused.
Our service referred Mr Js complaint to PayPal and explained they had up to eight weeks to 
issue a response to Mr Js complaint. Mr J said no response was received within this time, 
so our service continued with Mr Js complaint.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They explained from the 
evidence they had available to them, they thought PayPal had acted fairly when handling Mr 
Js dispute and issuing him a full refund. They also provided Mr J the opportunity to provide 
further clarity on his complaint and evidence that interest had been charge at this time.
Mr J didnt agree and maintained his belief that PayPal had acted unfairly, and that interest 
hadnt been factored into the refund. But as no further evidence was provided, our 
investigator explained their view remained the same. As Mr J didnt agree, the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr J. I recognise Mr J paid for 
an item that he didnt receive. So, I can appreciate the frustration and upset this wouldve 
caused him, as well as the financial impact during the time he was without the payment he 
made. I understand he contacted PayPal to secure a refund of this payment and I appreciate 
Mr J wouldve wanted this to be credited into his account as quickly as possible and that he 
doesnt believe PayPal did so.
But for me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts user agreement and Buyer Protection Programme (BPP) 
when processing Mr Js refund. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, that it was unfair 
for them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case. 
I can see Mr J first raised his dispute with PayPal on 26 April 2021. So, by this point Mr J 
had been without the item or his payment for around two months. I can see the following 
day, PayPal progressed his dispute and suspended any interest relating to the payment. 
PayPal then allowed the seller the opportunity to provide evidence to challenge Mr Js 
disputed, which falls in line with the BPP process.
I can see PayPal sent a message to Mr J, confirming this process and explaining the seller 
had until 7 May to reply. And when the seller hadnt responded by this date, I can see 
PayPal processed the refund into Mr Js account. So, it took 11 days for PayPal to refund the 
transaction from the date they received Mr Js dispute. And this falls in line with the time 
frame stated within the terms of the BPP, which explains they aim to escalate a claim for 
reimbursement within 20 days of the dispute opening. So, I dont think Im able to say PayPal 
acted unfairly, or outside of their set process. 
And while I recognise Mr J feels PayPal havent considered the interest hes been charged 
on this payment; I can see from PayPals system notes that any interest was suspended. 
And PayPal have since confirmed no interest was charged on this payment. Without any 
evidence from Mr J to show otherwise, and I note hes been offered the opportunity to 
provide this, I think its reasonable for me to assume interest hasnt been charged. And so, I 
cant say PayPal have done anything wrong by not factoring interest into the refund they 
processed.
Because of the above, I think PayPal have acted fairly on this occasion and so, I dont think 
they need to do anything further. I understand this isnt the outcome Mr J was hoping for. 
And I recognise it doesnt compensate him for the time he was without the item or his 
payment. But I dont think this period was due to anything PayPal did wrong. I also want to 
note my awareness that Mr J did raise another similar dispute around the same time. But no 
complaint has been raised with PayPal about this and so, this isnt something considered 
when reaching my decision.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Js complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2022.
