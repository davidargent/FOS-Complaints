The complaint
Mrs L complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA placed a limitation on her account.
Mrs L is being represented by a third party. 
What happened
On 07 April 2020 PayPal placed a limitation on Mrs Ls account. PayPal said this was firstly 
to look into the possibility it was linked to another account with a large negative balance. 
PayPal also said it decided to look into Mrs Ls selling activity. 
On 11 August 2020 PayPal released the limitation. 
Mrs L has now complained via a representative for the time it took the limitation to be 
removed. Mrs L says she had a large amount of money frozen in the account, and this 
prevented her from buying new stock. Mrs L said the losses her business suffered were 
around £122,000. 
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. PayPal said that it had acted within its 
user agreement and had limited the account as it found it may pose a significant risk to the 
business  namely it being linked to another high-risk account. PayPal did offer to pay Mrs L 
£150 for being a valued customer. Mrs L and her representative remained unhappy, so the 
complaint was brought to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but also didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found PayPal had acted within the terms and conditions of the account and 
found there were reasonable grounds to limit the account whilst it was being investigated. 
Mrs L and her representative didnt agree with the investigators view. Mrs Ls representative 
said PayPals actions were not completed with due skill and care, nor with due regard to her 
interests nor treating her fairly. 
Our investigator wasnt persuaded to change his view, so the complaints been passed to me 
for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having do so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts user agreement. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, 
that it was unfair for it to limit the account in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this 
situation, I dont think thats the case.
Its also common industry practice for firms to monitor accounts for activity which may fall 
outside their risk appetite, and accounts will often be restricted to prevent potential losses 
while carrying out a review
When PayPal decided to limit Mrs Ls account in April 2020, it did so as there was evidence 
it may be linked to an account with a large negative balance. PayPal have supplied 
information to show why it thought the accounts were connected and Im satisfied with the 
reasons its given. Its clear that there are a number of similaritys and matches between the 
company Mrs L is trading from and the account PayPal thought may be connected. These is 
a section in PayPals user agreement that mentions linked accounts.
As outlined in the section Restricted Activities of the PayPal User Agreement, our 
customers must not:
Control an account that is linked to another account that has engaged in any restricted 
activities;
As the investigator has pointed out, Mrs L did sign up to a user agreement when she opened 
an account with PayPal. Having looked through this agreement carefully, Ive found that 
PayPal have acted within the terms of the agreement when it took the decision to limit Mrs 
Ls account. I can see that Mrs L did supply PayPal with the information it asked for very 
quickly, but PayPal took the decision to limit the account whilst it continues to review the 
information and the accounts activity. 
PayPal have said that although it was satisfied Mrs Ls account could stay open even with 
the possible links to the third-party account, it wanted to review Mrs Ls selling activity and 
business model. PayPal classed this account as high-risk and made the decision to limit the 
account for a longer period to safeguard the business against buyer disputes and the risk of 
payments being reversed. Although PayPal are within their rights to limit an account, it 
needs to do so fairly. Ive looked at the reasons for this limitation and how long it took PayPal 
to complete the review. Having done so, I havent found PayPal have acted outside of its 
user agreement or that it limited the account for an unreasonable amount of time. 
I understand Mrs Ls representative has said that PayPal couldve asked for the information 
relating to the linked account before limiting it. PayPal dont have to give a notice period to 
limit an account and its common for PayPal to limit the account at the point it realises a user 
may be in breach of the user agreement, as it has done here. 
Mrs Ls representative has gone on to say that Mrs L had more money in the account than 
the debt owed by the third-party account. Ive thought about this point carefully but having 
done so I havent found it has changed my decision to not uphold this complaint. At the point 
PayPal limited the account, it was looking into the possibility of a breach of its user 
agreement. If PayPal had found Mrs L had breached the agreement, its not clear if it 
wouldve tried to recover any funds or simply closed Mrs Ls account. So, I dont find the 
money outstanding on the third party account to be relevant in the circumstances of this 
complaint.
In summary Paypal can limit an account and aslk foir information from a consumer. It has 
done in the circumstances of this complaint and I havent found it acted unfairly or outside of 
the terms of the account by doing so.   
PayPal have offered Mrs L compensation for being a loyal customer. As I havent found 
PayPal have done anything wrong, I havent reviewed it as part of this complaint. My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2022.
