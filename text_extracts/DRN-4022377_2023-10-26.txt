The complaint
A charity, C, complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wrongly reversed a payment 
that C made to its website provider.
C is represented in this complaint by Mr K, one of its trustees.
What happened
Mr K told us:
Cs website provider submitted a bill to C through PayPal. He fully intended to pay 
that bill, but something went wrong  with the result that a chargeback was instigated 
against the website provider and an allegation of fraud was made.
The website provider then closed Cs account with it, in accordance with its terms 
and conditions. It explained that as chargebacks are typically associated with 
fraudulent activity, [we have] to take a zero tolerance approach, where a chargeback 
is received we have to consider the account in question as fraudulent and close out 
the account immediately to protect the card holder and ourselves from further 
fraudulent activity. Chargebacks are also extremely damaging to our reputation.
He asked PayPal to reverse the chargeback and withdraw the fraud allegation, but it 
refused. PayPal maintained that the chargeback was instigated at the request of Cs 
bank  an assertion the bank firmly denies  and that it was beyond PayPals remit to 
reverse the chargeback.
The impact of the dispute was that Cs website was offline for several months from 
mid August 2022. The timing was particularly difficult because Cs members usually 
renew their subscriptions in September using Cs website. By the beginning of 
October 2021 around 75% of Cs members had renewed their subscription. The 
equivalent figure for October 2022 was less than 20%. The reduction in subscriptions 
is directly attributable to the loss of the website and resulting confusion.
PayPal told us:
On 8 August 2022 Mr K made a payment of £86.39 using Cs PayPal account. Mr K 
says that PayPal reversed this payment and is requesting PayPal to cancel this and 
return the funds to the merchant.
On 12 August 2022 PayPal received a request from Mr Ks bank to reverse the 
funds (although PayPal did not specify which funds the bank was referring to).
PayPal investigated the transaction and found in Mr Ks favour as the merchant was 
unable to provide evidence (again, it did not specify which transaction it meant or 
what evidence it had asked for). The transaction was reversed back to an account 
controlled by Mr K on 18 August 2022.
Overall, it considers that this chargeback case was resolved by a reversal of the 
transaction. PayPal was not at fault, did not initiate the reversal of the transaction, 
and correctly followed all relevant procedures.
We also asked Cs bank for its comments on this matter. It told us:
We were not able to find a record of [a] transaction for £86.39 being returned on the 
account we hold for [C]. We can confirm an auto return via the AUDDIS system for 
the Direct Debit of £31.99, due to the Direct Debit not being active on the account
As the mandate is dormant, the payment is forwarded automatically to an auto-return 
account. From this account, the payment [will] be automatically returned to the 
originator with the reason (advance notice disputed). This is an automated process 
and there has not been any manual decision made in respect of this Direct Debit 
being returned.
One of our investigators recommended that Cs complaint against PayPal be upheld. She 
said it wasnt clear why PayPal reversed the payment to Cs website provider, and in any 
event, PayPal should have notified C when the direct debit became dormant. She said 
PayPal should resolve the issues surrounding the direct debit, and pay in compensation. 
PayPal did not accept our investigators conclusions and asked for the complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision earlier this month. I said:
There are two transactions involved in this dispute:
The £86.69 that C attempted to pay its website provider via PayPal on 8 August 
2022. I will call this the PayPal transaction.
The £31.99 that PayPal attempted to take from Cs bank account via direct debit, 
which I will call the Direct Debit transaction. (It is not clear to me whether this 
was in fact one attempt at a transaction or many. I have seen references to 
various dates between 8 and 12 August 2022, and it may be that the different 
dates reflect several attempts to collect the money. But I dont think that 
confusion is material, and so in this decision I will refer to a single Direct Debit 
transaction.)
The figure of £31.99 is the difference between the £86.69 that C wanted to pay its 
website provider and the £54.40 that C already held in its PayPal account as at 8 August 
2022.
I think there has been some confusion about why the Direct Debit transaction was 
returned unpaid, with PayPal suggesting at one point that Mr K must have contacted his 
bank directly to file a chargeback claim. However, given the banks evidence, including 
the BACS report it provided, I am satisfied that the bank did indeed return the Direct 
Debit transaction unpaid. I am further satisfied that it did so automatically, with no 
manual intervention by anyone.
I can see that PayPal wrote to C on 12 August 2022 to say:
You recently attempted to transfer money from your bank account to your 
PayPal account.Your bank declined the money transfer on 08-Aug-2022.
We werent able to charge the credit card or bank account listed as your backup 
funding source, but we were able to complete your payment to [the website 
provider] by using money from your PayPal balance.
However, it appears that after telling C that it was able to complete the payment to the 
website provider, PayPal then reversed the PayPal transaction.
PayPal has not provided any evidence to suggest that the bank requested the reversal of 
the PayPal transaction or alleged fraud in respect of it. I think it is inherently unlikely that 
the bank would have done such a thing  I cant see any reason for the bank to have 
even known about (let alone cared about) a PayPal transaction between C and the 
website provider.
I also think it is unlikely that Mr K or C requested the reversal of the PayPal transaction. 
Mr K has been clear throughout that he wanted to make a payment of £86.69 to the 
website provider. PayPal has not provided any evidence to suggest that Mr K or C ever 
asked for the PayPal transaction to be reversed, nor has it provided any evidence to 
suggest that Mr K or C ever alleged fraud
On balance, despite its denial I therefore think it is likely that it was PayPal that initiated 
the chargeback of the PayPal transaction  though I might change my mind on that (or 
on any other aspect of the complaint) in light of further evidence from the parties.
In principle, I dont think it was unfair for PayPal to reverse the £86.89 payment that Mr K 
wanted to make to the website provider, even though it had told Mr K that the payment 
had gone through. The failure of the Direct Debit transaction left PayPal in the position 
where the PayPal transaction was partly unfunded, and PayPal had no way to 
automatically collect the missing £31.99. So, on the assumption that it was PayPal that 
initiated the chargeback, I dont criticise it for doing so. That means I dont think it would 
be fair for me to order PayPal to pay any compensation to C for the consequences of Cs 
website being offline. I dont think it was PayPals fault that the bill went unpaid, nor was 
it PayPals fault that C was unable to quickly reinstate its website (either with the original 
provider or a new one).
I also dont criticise PayPal, as the originator of the direct debit, for failing to tell C that 
the direct debit instruction was dormant. I would not normally expect anyone (bank or 
originator) to proactively inform a payer that an instruction had become dormant. That 
means I dont think it would be fair for me to order PayPal to do anything further in 
respect of the direct debit.
However, I do think PayPals customer service was very poor. It told Mr K that it was 
able to complete the payment to the website provider, but did not do so. It blamed Mr K 
and Cs bank for instigating the reversal of the PayPal transaction, but has not explained 
why it reached that view. It also appears to have entirely misunderstood the problem, in 
that it told Mr K that since C had its money back it considered the matter resolved. In my 
view, the point was that Mr K wanted Cs website provider rather than C to have the 
money.
I went on to explain why I thought the investigator was right to recommend that PayPal pay 
£250 in compensation.
Neither party provided any new evidence or arguments in response to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached the same conclusions as I did in my provisional decision, for 
the same reasons. I therefore confirm those provisional conclusions as final.
Putting things right
I remain satisfied that an award of £250 is fair. Im mindful that that amount is almost three 
times as much as the PayPal transaction at the centre of this dispute, but in the 
circumstances of this complaint I think it does represent fair compensation.
The complainant here is the charity C, not Mr K personally, so any compensation should be 
paid to C. The impact of PayPals poor customer service was that Mr K, in his capacity as a 
representative of C, made significant efforts to work out what had happened. If PayPal had 
given him a clear explanation from the start, I dont think he would have needed to contact 
either PayPal or Cs bank so many times. PayPals poor customer service therefore caused 
inconvenience to C.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
pay C £250.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2023.
