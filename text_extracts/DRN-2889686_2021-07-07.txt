The complaint
Mr R complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the way they managed his 
credit account after he changed current accounts.
What happened
In mid-2019, Mr R switched his current account between lenders. As part of this switch, he 
asked for his existing direct debits to be moved across. One of these direct debits related to 
his PayPal credit account.
Unfortunately, Mr Rs direct debit wasnt switched correctly. So, his minimum monthly 
payment wasnt paid on his PayPal credit account in August 2019. Mr R tried to log into his 
PayPal account online to change his direct debit details, but he was unable to do so. So, he 
contacted PayPal.
PayPal explained his PayPal account had been locked as there was an outstanding balance 
on his normal PayPal account. Because of this, Mr R wasnt able to log in and alter details 
on his credit account until this outstanding balance had been cleared. But this balance 
related to a dispute Mr R had ongoing with the merchant and PayPal. And he didnt want to 
pay it. Mr R was unhappy that PayPal werent allowing him to change his direct debit details 
as his account was accruing interest and charges, as well and recording negative 
information against his credit file. So, he raised a complaint.
PayPal didnt initially reply within the eight-week time period. But when they did issue a 
response, they thought theyd acted fairly. They explained theyd attempted to process the 
new direct debit mandate, and that it was Mr Rs bank that had cancelled it. And they 
thought theyd acted in line with their user policy by locking Mr Rs online account until the 
outstanding balance on his normal account was cleared. So, they didnt think theyd done 
anything wrong and didnt offer to do anything more. Mr R was unhappy with this response, 
so he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. She thought shed seen enough 
evidence to show it was Mr Rs bank, and not PayPal, that had caused the error in 
transferring Mr Rs direct debit. So, she didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong with 
this aspect of the complaint. And she recognised PayPals user agreement gave them the 
authority to lock Mr Rs online account if he was in arrears on an account. But she didnt 
think it was fair to lock Mr R out of his credit account, when it was only his normal account in 
arrears. She thought it was clear Mr R wanted to make payments to his credit account, and 
she didnt think PayPal had given Mr R a fair opportunity to do so. So, she thought PayPal 
should remove all interest and charges applied to the account from August 2019, and 
remove any negative information reported to his credit file for the same period.
Mr R was willing to accept this outcome. But PayPal didnt. They maintained their view that, 
as Mr R had an outstanding balance on his normal account, theyd locked his online account 
fairly, in line with the terms of their user agreement. And they didnt think the error is 
switching the direct debit was anything to do with them. So, they didnt think they needed to 
do anything more. As PayPal didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr R. Ive no doubt Mr R had 
every intention of making his monthly payments to his PayPal credit account. And from the 
calls Ive listened to, Mr R was aware failing to make these payments would impact his credit 
file. So, when he realised PayPal had locked him out of his online account, and provided him 
with no alternative options to set up a new direct debit, I think this would been frustrating and 
upsetting for Mr R. 
So, Ive considered whether PayPal acted reasonably when taking this action. Ive thought 
about whether they were at fault for the error in the direct debit not being set up. Ive seen 
the mandate sent to them by Mr Rs new current account provider. And Ive seen they 
attempted to set up the direct debit. From what Ive seen, it was Mr Rs current account 
provider that cancelled the direct debit mandate. Because of this, I cant fairly say that the 
issue with the failed direct debit was caused by PayPal.
Ive then thought about PayPals decision to lock Mr R out of his online account. Ive listened 
to the calls Mr R held with PayPal that have been provided. And Im aware there were other 
conversations, but PayPal havent provided these as they dont think they impact the 
complaint. So, Ive used the evidence I have available to reach my decision, and where 
necessary thought about what I think is most likely to have happened in the other 
conversations.
PayPal made Mr R aware he was unable to access his online account as there was a lock in 
place as he had an outstanding balance on his normal PayPal account. Mr R doesnt dispute 
there was an outstanding balance. And Ive seen from the user agreement that PayPal are 
able to restrict access to online accounts if there is a balance owing to them. So, I cant say 
theyve acted outside the user agreement and I can understand why PayPal think this shows 
them acting reasonably.
But, crucially, Im also able to consider whether I think PayPal acted fairly by relying on the 
terms of the agreement in this situation. And having done so, I dont think they have.
I appreciate Mr R had a balance outstanding on his normal account. But I think its clear Mr 
R had every intention of paying his PayPal credit account and he was aware of the impact 
missing payments on this would have on his credit file. Although I recognise Mr Rs two 
accounts were linked to one PayPal online login, I dont think it was fair for PayPal to restrict 
Mr Rs access to his credit account due to a balance outstanding on a totally different 
account. 
From the calls Ive listened to, PayPal explained they were unable to set up a new direct 
debit over the phone and that is could only be done online. And Ive heard Mr R was passed 
through to PayPals limitations team to try and rectify the issue. I havent had this call 
recording to listen to. But, as Mr R has referred his complaint to us and said his issue hasnt 
been resolved, I think its reasonable for me to assume Mr R wasnt granted access to his online account to change his direct debit details. Or, that PayPal provided Mr R with a viable 
alternative solution.
By failing to grant this access, or provide another solution, I think PayPal forced Mr R into a 
position where he was incurring interest and late payment fees through no fault of his own. 
And this will have impacted Mr Rs credit file, which may impact his ability to obtain future 
credit. Because of this, I think PayPal acted unfairly and I think they need to address this.
Putting things right
As I think PayPal have acted unfairly, Ive then thought about what I think they need to do to 
put things right. Any direction I make is intended to put Mr R back in the position he wouldve 
been, had PayPal acted fairly in this situation.
Had PayPal acted fairly and allowed Mr R access to his account to change his direct debit 
details or provided Mr R with an alternative option to do so, I think he wouldve done this 
when he called. So, I think PayPal should refund Mr R any interest or charges his credit 
account has accrued since August 2019, when he attempted to amend the direct debit.
And as Mr R was prevented from paying his credit account, PayPal have confirmed any late 
payments were reported Mr Rs credit file. As I dont think this was Mr Rs fault, I think any 
adverse data should be removed from Mr Rs credit file from August 2019.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Rs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and direct them to take the following action:
Refund any interest and charges applied to the account since August 2019; and
Remove any adverse data reported to Mr Rs credit from August 2019 onwards.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2021.
