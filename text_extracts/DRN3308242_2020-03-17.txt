K821x#15complaint
Mrs P complains that Evergreen  Finance London  Limited (trading as MoneyBoat)  was 
irresponsible to lend to her.
background
Mrs P had two loans from MoneyBoat between August 2018 and November 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly  
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 20 Aug 2018 £800 6m £216.85 30 Jan 2019 30 Aug 2018
2 18 Nov 2018 £1,500 6m £437.64 25 Apr 2019 Outstanding
Mrs P says MoneyBoat did not carry out relevant affordability checks and did not respond 
sympathetically to her financial difficulties
MoneyBoat says it carried out a credit check and was satisfied Mrs P could sustainably  
make the repayments.  It says it also asked Mrs P about her income and expenditure and 
verified her declared salary. MoneyBoat says Mrs P had sufficient disposable income to 
repay the loans.  It acknowledged that Mrs P was in financial difficulties, but said that was 
due to a change of circumstances rather than an issue with the affordability of the loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He found that the 
information MoneyBoat had showed Mrs P was already having  trouble managing  her money  
and was likely to be unable to sustainably repay the loans. He recommended interest and 
charges should  be refunded on the loans (plus 8% statutory interest), any further interest 
owed should be waived and adverse information removed from Mrs Ps credit file.
MoneyBoat responded to say, in summary, that its checks were proportionate  and it would 
be unrealistic to review every line of a credit file at the early  stages of lending.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MoneyBoat was required to lend responsibly.  It should have made  checks to make  sure 
Mrs P could afford to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those  checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mrs P was borrowing, and her lending history. 
But there was no set list of checks MoneyBoat had to do.
Im satisfied MoneyBoat  did proportionate checks at the time of the lending, as it says it did. 
But it also needed to review the results  of those checks before making its lending  decision. I 
consider it likely that, had MoneyBoat properly reviewed Mrs Ps credit file, it would have 
seen indications that she was already struggling  to manage her money. I say that because 
Mrs Ps credit  file showed she was already  behind  with some repayments and shed opened 
25 new accounts in the previous six months. I accept what  MoneyBoat  says about reviewing 
every line of a credit  file for a first loan application,  but I think  these  top level indicators 
should have prompted further questions.
Ref: DRN33082422If MoneyBoat had asked Mrs P about  her other loans, or if it had checked  her credit file more 
thoroughly, it would have found  shed taken out at least five other loans in the last three 
months and repayments  on those  alone  totalled almost £1,350 per month. In addition,  Mrs P 
had at least three accounts  with debt collection agencies.
So Im satisfied that Mrs P was unlikely to be able to sustainably  repay  either of the loans 
and MoneyBoat should not have approved them.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Evergreen Finance London Limited  (trading as 
MoneyBoat) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mrs P paid on the loans;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 2, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mrs P; 
Remove any negative  information about the loans from Mrs Ps credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest.  MoneyBoat 
must give Mrs P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. If 
MoneyBoat intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it must  do 
so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 April 2020.
