The complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr C has said he got into a cycle of debt leading to repeat borrowing which worsened 
his already poor financial situation.                       
What happened
This complaint is about 23 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr C between 
September 2016 to May 2019 Mr Cs borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought that none of the loans should have 
been give because if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks, it would have seen that 
Mr C spent a significant amount of his income on on-line gambling so it was unlikely he 
would be able to repay the loans sustainably. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 12 onwards but Mr C didnt 
accept the offer. 
Sunny also said there were gaps in the lending between loans one and two, loans six and 
seven and loans nine and ten.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in full. Ill explain why. 
In its response to the adjudicator, Sunny has said there were gaps in the lending. This would 
mean that effectively the borrowing relationship would re-start afresh after any gap and less 
checks would again be proportionate. But I dont think the length of time between loans one 
and two, six and seven and nine and ten (between two and four months) was significant 
enough for Sunny to have assumed that Mr C had overcome whatever the financial problem 
was that caused him to take short-term credit in the first instance. 
Sunny has told us that at the outset of the borrowing relationship it asked Mr C for details of 
his income and expenditure, other short-term lending commitments and carried out a credit 
search. But given the length of the term of the first loan and the amount Mr C was borrowing, 
I think Sunny should have been verifying what Mr C was telling it. This could have been 
done by asking for evidence of what he had told Sunny  such as copies of pay slips, bank 
statements etc.  
And, as our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check at the outset of the borrowing 
relationship Mr C had with Sunny would most likely have shown that Mr C was a frequent 
user of gambling websites. It also would have been clear that Mr C was repaying existing 
borrowing with other short-term credit providers which would have sign posted that Mr C 
wasnt managing his personal finances well. And I note  as examples  that in the two 
months prior to his initial borrowing with Sunny when Mr Cs bank account went into an 
overdrawn position, he took further short-term lending with other providers. So, Mr C was 
already struggling with his finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out six loans within six months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Cs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr C was repaying his loans before the agreed term. While this would have saved Mr 
C charges in interest, it can also be a sign of someone struggling to manage their 
finances. I say this because Mr C would return for further borrowing. And given the 
nature of short-term lending I would question why someone would repay one loan 
only to replace it with another. 
Mr C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 23 was 
taken out over two and a half years after Mr Cs first. Mr C had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint in full and Sunny should put things 
right.
Putting things right
If the outstanding balance due on Mr Cs loans has been transferred to a third party Sunny 
should buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loans back, then it needs to work 
with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr C towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr C originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mr C as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Mr C having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr C. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr C. 
E) Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to loans one to 
five.
The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loan six onwards should be removed from Mr Cs 
credit file. Sunny does not have to remove the outstanding loans from 
Mr Cs credit file until these have been repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans should still be removed.                                                                                          
                                   
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr C still has an outstanding balance due, then Sunny should try and 
work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Mr C in order to repay 
what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Mr C fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2020.
