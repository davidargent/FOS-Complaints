The complaint
Mr K complains about the amount that hes been charged by LeasePlan UK Limited for 
rental of a car under a hire agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr K under a hire agreement with LeasePlan that he signed in 
June 2016. The duration of the hire was extended by a modifying agreement that Mr K 
signed in June 2019 and he then agreed to make monthly rental payments of £382.86. He 
agreed to buy the car in March 2021 and paid the price for it in April 2021. He then received 
an invoice of £382.86 for a monthly rental and an invoice of £38.28 for a termination rental.
Mr K complained to LeasePlan about those invoices but it said that, although hed asked to 
take ownership of the car in March 2021, it didnt receive cleared funds until April 2021 so 
the invoices remained payable. Mr K wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that that the 
car purchase wasnt finalised until April 2021 and he believed that it would be unreasonable 
to ask LeasePlan to absorb the cost whilst the car was still on hire. He also said that hed 
listened to recordings of Mr Ks phone calls with LeasePlan and he didnt agree with Mr K 
that LeasePlan had agreed with his views over the phone and he wasnt persuaded that he 
should be asking LeasePlan to take any further action.
Mr K has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the error 
was the delay in sending him the invoice in the post and during that time he was still being 
charged for rental even though hed agreed to buy the car  and he shouldnt have to pay for 
rental after hed agreed to buy the car. He says that hes been unemployed since last June 
and is not in a position to pay the invoices.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr K had agreed to hire the car under the hire agreement and the modifying 
agreement with LeasePlan, and in March 2021 the monthly rental for the car was 
£382.86;
he contacted LeasePlan about buying the car in March 2021 and agreed to buy it 
later that month - he was sent an invoice for the car by post but it wasnt posted to 
him until some days later and his payment for the car wasnt received by LeasePlan 
until April 2021;
he then received an invoice for a monthly rental of £382.86 and another invoice for a 
termination rental of £38.28 in April 2021  those rentals covered the period until 
LeasePlan had received payment for the purchase of the car;
Mr K clearly feels very strongly that he shouldnt have to pay any rental for the period 
after hed agreed to buy the car and he says that there was an unnecessary delay in 
the invoice being sent to him and that LeasePlan agreed with him in a phone call that 
he shouldnt have to pay the additional rental charges;
theres an important difference between agreeing to buy a car and the purchase 
being completed  I dont consider that Mr K had bought the car until LeasePlan had 
received payment for it and I consider that its fair and reasonable for LeasePlan to 
charge Mr K the rental payments for the period until the payment was received;
I can understand Mr Ks frustration that there was a delay between him agreeing to 
buy the car and the invoice for the car being sent to him  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that LeasePlan unfairly or unreasonably delayed 
the purchase or that it has acted incorrectly in these circumstances;
the monthly rental of £382.86 for which he was invoiced related partly to a period 
before hed agreed to buy the car and to part of the period between his agreement to 
buy the car and his payment being received by LeasePlan  and the termination 
rental related to the remainder of the period between his agreement to buy the car 
and his payment being received by LeasePlan;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that LeasePlan agreed with 
Mr K that he shouldnt have to pay the additional rental charges; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
LeasePlan to reduce, or waive, the outstanding rental payments that are due from 
Mr K, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
Mr K says that hes been unemployed since June 2021 and that he cant afford to pay the 
outstanding amount to LeasePlan. I suggest that he contacts LeasePlan to explain his 
financial difficulties and to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount 
that he owes to it. Its required to respond to his financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically. If he doesnt do so, I consider it to be likely that LeasePlan will take further 
action (to the extent that its legally entitled to do so) to try to recover the outstanding amount 
from him.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
