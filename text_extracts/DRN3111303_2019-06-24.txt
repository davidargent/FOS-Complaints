Mr B, represented by a third party, complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) lent money to him that he couldnt afford to repay.
background
Based on the information provided, Mr B entered into 13 loans with QuickQuid (plus  top up 
loans) between  September 2014 and August  2017.

Mr B says that the lending was irresponsible. He says that QuickQuid should  have realised 
he couldnt afford the loans and that he had to borrow more to make his repayments.  He 
says the loans trapped him in a spiral  of debt.
QuickQuid says that highest  fee associated with the first three loans (provided between 
September and November 2014)  was 6% of Mr Bs disposable income. It says the loans 
were repaid  on time or early and no rollovers or extensions were  requested.  
There was a gap between loans three and four and QuickQuid says that before  loans  four to 
13 were provided appropriate and proportionate affordability checks were carried  out. It says 
there were further gaps  in Mr Bs borrowing and that the amounts borrowed fluctuated. It 
says that Mr B had a good repayment  history. 
Our adjudicator noted that there was a break  of around 18 months between the repayment 
of loan three and the application  for loan four. She didnt  think  there was enough evidence to 
say that loans one to eight shouldnt have been  provided. However by the time loan nine 
was provided she thought  Mr Bs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant  on short-term loans. She didnt  think  QuickQuid should've  given Mr B any 
of loans nine to 13.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. It didnt accept that the number of loans 
provided meant that lending was unsustainable. It said that Mr Bs borrowing history didnt 
suggest he was in financial difficulty and its checks showed he could afford the repayments. 
As a resolution hasnt  been agreed, this complaint  has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to consider.
Ref: DRN31113032my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr B could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
In this case, the first three loans were taken out in 2014 and then Mr B didnt take out 
another loan with QuickQuid until around  18 months  later.  Therefore I think  it reasonable to 
consider the first three loans as part of a lending chain and loans four to 13 (including  top up 
loans) as part of a second  lending chain.
Ref: DRN31113033Although there were  some gaps between the loans in the second lending  chain, these  
werent for a substantial  amount  of time and I dont think  it would  have been  reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  these were any indication that Mr Bs finances  had moved  on from 
whatever situation  had required  his previous  loans.
Information was gathered  before the loans in the fist lending chain were  provided and based 
on what I have seen  I dont find I have enough to say these  shouldnt  have been provided.
Considering the second  lending chain, information about Mr Bs income and expenses was 
gathered and based on what I have  seen I dont think I have enough to say that loans four to 
eight shouldnt have  been provided.
However, I agree with our adjudicator that by loan nine Mr Bs overall pattern of borrowing 
suggested he had become persistently reliant on short-term loans. In this second lending 
chain, Mr B had taken out six loans in eight months, and the loan amounts were roughly the 
same over this period. For the rest of Mr Bs borrowing with QuickQuid the amount borrowed 
didnt significantly reduce and a number  of top ups were provided. Based on this, I think that 
loans nine onwards were  unsustainable. 
Overall, I think that Mr B lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 
loan nine onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr B's indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short term use over an extended period of 
time. The sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr B's 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  nine to 13. CashEuroNet 
UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr B paid on loans nine to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from nine means  any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans nine to 13 should be removed from Mr B's credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.
