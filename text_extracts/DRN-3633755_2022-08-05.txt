The complaint
Miss M complains National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt fixed problems shes been having 
authenticating and has made multiple mistakes in its dealings with her. Miss M complains 
that this means she hasnt had online access to her account for over a year, nor has she 
received the service National Westminster Bank Plc claims it provides its customers.
What happened
Miss M has a current account with NatWest. She opened the account several years ago  at 
the time she was living in the UK. She subsequently moved to New Zealand and was able to 
carry on operating the account without any problems. She had a debit card and card reader.
Miss M contacted NatWest in February 2021 saying that she was having problems receiving 
the one-time passcodes she now needed in order to log into her online banking. She says 
that NatWests staff hung up on her several times when she called about the problems she 
was having and that no-one called back when she was told someone would do so.
NatWest looked into Miss Ms complaint and said that it needed to update her mobile 
number on its system and re-register her for online banking. NatWest sent Miss M an online 
banking activation code  so she could re-register  and paid her £140 in compensation for 
the poor service shed received when shed called about the problems shed been having.
Miss M told NatWest that she received her online banking activation code and had been able 
to re-register herself for online banking. But she remained unhappy. She told NatWest that 
her card reader wasnt working and that shed incurred costs calling about the problems 
shed been having  shed called from abroad. Shed also incurred costs transferring money 
from another account because she couldnt access her NatWest account. Miss M also told 
NatWest that she still wasnt receiving one-time passcodes on her mobile phone and that it 
wasnt a problem with her mobile as she was receiving messages from other businesses.
NatWest looked into Miss Ms complaint further and said that it would send her another card 
reader which would take up to 15 working days to arrive in New Zealand. In the meantime, 
NatWest paid Miss M an additional £110 in compensation for the poor service shed 
continued to receive  taking the total compensation to £250. NatWest said that it would be 
happy to consider reimbursing further costs she said shed incurred if she sent in evidence of 
those costs. NatWest also said that it had looked into why Miss M wasnt receiving one-time 
passcodes and its systems showed the messages were being delivered.
Miss M was unhappy with NatWests response and complained to us saying that she was 
once again unable to log into her account. She said she wanted a permanent fix and 
additional compensation, amongst other things, and wasnt happy with what she felt were 
misleading comments from NatWest about the services it offers.
In April 2021, one of our investigators started investigating Miss Ms complaint and her 
ongoing problems logging into her account. In the meantime, NatWest said it was going to 
send Miss M another card reader as it had sent her replacement card to a UK address it had 
on file for her. NatWest sent this second card reader by recorded delivery. NatWest offered 
Miss M an additional £100 in compensation on top of the £250 it had already paid because 
of the further issues shed experience. NatWest told Miss M that it planned to introduce facial 
recognition for app users in May 2021 as an alternative to card readers and text messages.
In June 2021 Miss M told us that shed received her new card reader  the one NatWest had 
sent by recorded delivery. Miss M complained that this was two months after reporting her 
original card reader wasnt working and that she was still having problems logging on.
Our investigator looked into Miss Ms complaint further and was told by NatWest that it 
wasnt at that stage going to be introducing facial recognition for customers who wanted to 
log into their online banking  the feature it was going to be introducing was for customers 
who wanted, for example, to change mobile number, make a new payment, add a payee or 
amend limits. NatWest offered £100 in compensation for giving misleading information about 
its plans to introduce facial recognition, and then offered £250 in compensation.
In October 2021, Miss M told us that the card reader shed received in June 2021 didnt 
always work. Our investigator asked NatWest to send a new card reader to Miss M in New 
Zealand  in other words, a third card reader.
Our investigator subsequently said that they were going to uphold Miss Ms complaint and 
that NatWests offer of £500 in compensation was fair and reasonable. Our investigator 
didnt think the evidence showed the problems Miss M was having receiving one-time 
passcodes were down to NatWest (as it had provided evidence that theyd been delivered) 
and that a card reader was a reasonable alternative in any event. Our investigator also said 
that they couldnt ask NatWest to reimburse the additional costs Miss M said shed incurred 
without evidence showing when the costs were incurred and why as this was needed to 
show that the costs were incurred as a result of a failure of NatWests part.
Miss M wasnt happy with our investigators recommendations. She said NatWest ought to 
reimburse the charges she had incurred transferring money from another account on top of 
the £500 in compensation. Shortly after our investigator had made their recommendations, 
they found out that NatWest had again sent Miss Ms replacement card reader to the UK 
address it had on file for her. NatWest agreed to send another card reader to Miss Ms New 
Zealand address  it did so in February 2022 and sent it by normal post. That card reader 
hadnt arrived three weeks after it had been sent, so NatWest sent another card reader and 
did so recorded delivery. Miss M received that card reader  her fourth. Miss M has since 
told us that this card reader doesnt always work, that shes still having problems with her 
online banking and that she wants £1,000 in compensation as well as a permanent fix.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision last month in which I said, amongst other things, that no-one 
is disputing that Miss M has had a lot of problems trying to get strong customer 
authentication working so that she can manage her NatWest account online. In that 
provisional decision, in light of Miss Ms experience of one-time passcodes via text message 
and card readers to date, I asked NatWest to explain step by step what Miss M would need 
to do in order to start using the app again, and what she would have to do in order to log into 
the app and what functions the app will allow her to perform including how.
In my provisional decision, I said that I would be requiring NatWest to take the steps that are 
necessary for Miss M to be able to authenticate using its mobile app in my final decision if it 
was clear that the app was a viable alternative for Miss M. Alternatively, I said that NatWest could, should it wish to do so, offer Miss M additional compensation to reflect the fact that 
she wont be able to manage her account in the way shed like to.
Putting things right
Both parties replied to my provisional decision, and based on what NatWest told me I 
consider it unlikely that Miss M will be able to get NatWests app working  although not 
impossible and, of course, both parties are free to explore that (or other options) if they wish. 
Ive contacted both parties since then, and as a result of that NatWest has offered to pay in 
total £1,000 in compensation in full and final of this complaint to reflect the distress and 
inconvenience Miss M has been through and the fact that shes unlikely to be able to 
manage her account in the way shed like to going forwards. I consider that offer to be fair.
My final decision
My final decision is that I require National Westminster Bank PLC to pay Miss M in total 
£1,000 in compensation in full and final settlement of this complaint. National Westminster 
Bank PLC has already paid Miss M £250, meaning it will have to pay her an additional £750.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 September 2022.
