The complaint
Ms J, through her representative, complains that Morses Club PLC lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Ms J had been borrowing from Morses or had borrowed from a company subsequently taken 
over by Morses, for several years. Neither Ms J nor Morses has been able to send to us any 
information about the loans apart from the last six. Those last six are set out here in a brief 
table.

I had no information about the earlier loans from either party and so I was not able I to 
review them. 
Morses has told us that it has no information from any credit searches it may have done for 
Ms J. And so, we asked Ms J for copies of several things such as bank statements, copy of 
her credit file, and other details. Ms J has told us that she cannot obtain any of those and we 
are to proceed with the information we have.
One of our adjudicators thought by loan 5 Morses ought to have ceased lending so he 
thought that Morses ought to put things right for Ms J for loans 5 and 6.
Morses disagreed with our adjudicators view and gave several reasons as to why it did not 
agree, all of which I have reviewed.
Ms J did not appear to disagree with our adjudicators view in that her representative had 
received our adjudicators view and had written to ask us for an update but said nothing 
further. It seemed that Ms J agreed with the adjudicators outcome. And so, I reviewed loans 
5 and 6, as the two remaining disputed loans, within the context of the overall lending 
relationship.
On 21 July I issued a provisional decision giving reasons why I did not plan to uphold the 
complaint. I had reviewed the details surrounding Ms Js finances at the time of approving 
the loans 5 and 6 and I disagreed with the adjudicators view on loans 5 and 6.
Since then, both parties have responded and neither has anything further to send or to add. 
In the circumstances I have no reason to alter my provisional findings which were the same 
as those set out in this decision. These make up my final decision on the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms J 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
I have decided not to uphold Ms Js complaint and have explained why below.
Using the brief information we have about Ms J and her financial circumstances for the last 
two loans, it seems that her income increased, the amount Ms J asked for was reducing to
£200, the terms were shorter  33 weeks rather than 50 weeks  and the weekly repayments 
had reduced slightly. 
Here is a duplication of the information we have about Ms Js income and expenditure from 
Morses records and in the absence of anything else, I have relied on these figures.loan income expenditure disposable 
income
1 £0.00 £0.00 £0.00
2 £0.00 £0.00 £0.00
3 £300.00 £220.00 £80.00
4 £346.15 £162.38 £183.77
5 £277.00 £108.00 £169.00
6 £473.00 £297.00 £176.00
So, I cannot see that Morses did anything wrong when assessing that Ms J was able to 
afford £10 each week for loans 5 and 6. The loans do not overlap. I have reviewed Ms Js 
payment history and I do not see anything there which likely would have caused concern to 
Morses to suggest that Ms J was struggling with the loans. Ms J appears to have repaid 
regularly, on time or early and I see no evidence of reliance there.
I have looked at the submissions put forward by Ms Js representative, particularly a 
document which is an excel spreadsheet named validation report. One of those pages on 
that spreadsheet lists many other loans by other lenders, with start dates from
December 2015 through to November 2018 and end dates ranging from November 2016 to 
April 2019. Theres little explanation about that spreadsheet and I gathered that the implied 
submission on Ms Js behalf was that Ms J had lots of other debt around the time she was 
borrowing from Morses. 
But theres no explanation and no verification about these loans and so I attach little weight 
to that validation report. All I have is a list of other lender names and loan dates. 
The puzzling element is that this information on that excel spreadsheet must have come 
from a credit file of some kind or Ms Js own records. Before I issued my provisional decision 
we had asked Ms J for additional documentation to substantiate some of the aspects of this 
complaint about Morses: nothing further was sent to us.
I referred to this list of other lenders in my provisional decision dated 21 July 2022 but since 
then neither Ms J nor her representative has explained further or said anything to elucidate 
on it. Ms Js response through her representative was 
We do not have any more information to Add To [sic] this complaint please continue 
with complaint of the Ombudsmans Decision.
So, without any verification of that list of other lenders, referred to as a validation report 
then I attach little weight to it. 
On current evidence I do not think that Ms J was unable to afford the loan repayments for 
loans 5 and 6. 
And on current evidence I do not think that the pattern of lending was of a kind that I am 
persuaded that Morses ought to have known Ms J was reliant or otherwise not able to 
sustain the repayments and that it ought to have ceased lending at loan 5.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Js complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2022.
