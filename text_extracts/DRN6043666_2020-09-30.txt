K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that Aviva Life & Pensions  UK Limited caused  delays in providing him with 
information about his pension options,  causing him to lose out on a higher transfer  value. 
background
Mr R held a stakeholder pension with Aviva. In January 2017,  Aviva sent Mr R information 
about his retirement  options. And, from at least August 2017 onwards,  Mr R contacted it with 
queries about  this and for updates on his fund value. 
On 5 January  2018, Mr R began to raise more  specific queries with Aviva about  his options. 
It responded to him on 23 January 2018, also explaining that as drawdown  wasnt  available  
on his current policy hed need to transfer to another plan if he wanted  to do this. The same  
day Mr R asked Aviva further questions by email  about transferring  his policy. On 30 
January 2018,  Mr R followed this up with additional queries. Aviva responded on 6 March  
2020 but it didnt answer  all Mr Rs questions. 
In March and April 2018, Mr R complained  to Aviva that he was unhappy  with the time taken 
to respond to him and with its failure to answer all his questions.  He also said it had caused 
him to lose money,  as the transfer  value of his pension  had since  dropped.  
In response, Aviva  recognised its delays in replying to Mr R, that some of his emails and 
questions werent  answered  and that it failed to record his contact with it in March 2018 as a 
complaint. Aviva offered Mr R £75 compensation for this. And, except for a query  about  the 
amount he could withdraw tax free from a drawdown  policy  with it  which it said hed need 
to redirect to that department  it answered his remaining questions.  
On 20 June 2018, Aviva received the necessary  information  for the pension  transfer. And, on 
29 June 2018,  Mr R transferred his pension to another policy  with Aviva that allows  him to 
drawdown, with an opening fund value  of £72,294.54 .
Mr R brought his complaint to our service, adding that he was passed between Aviva  and its 
drawdown department.  And that, after taking  weeks for an answer, he was told the transfer 
would take a further six weeks,  during which the value  had dropped. 
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Rs complaint. He said he was satisfied that if Aviva 
had replied to Mr Rs final queries made on 30 January 2018 in a reasonable time  being 21 
days  he would have  transferred his pension in February 2018. So it should pay Mr R 
£707.67  the difference  between the transfer value actually achieved and what he wouldve 
got had not delays occurred. He also said Aviva should pay Mr R a further  £100  for failings 
in customer service, taking total compensation to £175. 
Aviva accepted it didnt  answer all Mr Rs queries but says that, given its service standard of 
10 working days, it should have answered  these  by 13 February 2018. And as it would then 
have always taken it 31 working days to receive the necessary information for the pension  
transfer  taking it to 28 March 2018   and a further 7 working days for the funds to be 
released to the new pension,  this should have happened on 10 April 2018  instead of 
29 June 2018.  
Aviva said that as fair compensation depends on whether  Mr R incurred a financial loss as a 
result, it must review the actions he took when the funds were  transferred to the new policy. 
Ref: DRN60436662Mr R told us that after transferring his pension he took a 25% tax-free lump sum of 
£18,070.21, drew  down  two further sums and then invested £40,000 of his pension in a fund. 
Aviva said the transfer value of Mr Rs pension on 28 March 2018 was £69,812.92.  And that 
given it later achieved  £72,294.54 upon  transfer, this means  he was £2,481.62 better off. It 
said this mean Mr R had more to invest in funds and more  tax-free cash than he wouldve 
otherwise had. 
Aviva recognised though that if not for the delays Mr R would have obtained just over 196 
more units in the fund he later invested £40,000 of his pension  in. But it also said that if Mr R 
wanted to buy the units  hes lost out on at todays price this would cost him £228.27. And, 
even when considering this extra cost,  hes still £2,252.75 better off overall due to the higher 
transfer value  he obtained than he wouldve if not for the delays. 
After considering this, our investigator said that while its understandable Mr R thinks hes 
been disadvantaged given the transfer  values  he was sent in January and May 2018  were 
respectively £73,002  and £73,854, it was made clear that these were estimates and subject 
to fluctuation. He also felt it was reasonable to consider the delay using the timescales Aviva 
provided and, based  on these, it was fair to say Mr R was financially better off as a result.  
So, while Aviva caused delays at a time when this made difficult circumstances more 
stressful for Mr R, he wasnt  asking it to do anything more. 
In response, Mr R suggested he would accept a further £250 compensation in resolution of 
his complaint. And, as Aviva wasnt willing to do this, Mr Rs complaints been passed to me 
for a decision.
After reviewing the information on file that Aviva  had given to us about the units  Mr R held at 
the time and the relevant  price, I noticed a discrepancy. So I asked Aviva  about the transfer  
value it had provided as relevant on 28 March 2018. In response,  after checking  this with its 
actuarial department, it confirmed that the transfer value on 28 March 2018 wouldve been  
£68,752.29, rather than the earlier figure  it had given us of £69,812.92.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, while its clear Avivas  
made mistakes, Im not asking it to do anything further. Ill explain why. 
It isnt in dispute that Aviva got things  wrong.  Its recognised it failed to meet its 
10-working day response timescale, causing Mr R frustration, inconvenience  and delays in 
answering his questions,  which impacted on when he was able to transfer his pension fund. 
So I havent felt it necessary  to comment on the communication Mr R had with it in detail, 
other than to say that after considering the events (set out above) across the period in 
question  January  2018  onwards  Im satisfied that if Aviva had responded to Mr R in a 
reasonable timescale, being within or close to its service standard,  then I think  its likely Mr R 
wouldve secured  the transfer value relevant on 28 March 2018. And that his pension funds 
wouldve released to his new policy mid-April 2018,  instead of 29 June 2018. 
This means  that whats  left for me to decide,  and what I think is the main issue  in dispute  
here, is whether  Aviva should  do anything further to put this right. 
Ref: DRN60436663To do this, Ive considered what position Mr R would be in if hed been able to secure  the 
transfer value  on 28 March 2018  in the way he should have,  compared  to what he actually 
secured months  later. When doing so, I think its reasonable to assume that even if Mr R had 
been able to transfer earlier, he wouldve done  the same with his pension  fund as what he 
went on to do, given theres  nothing to suggest otherwise. And its only if Mr R has lost out 
financially that would I expect Aviva to put things right.  
I appreciate Mr R doesnt agree with Avivas calculations as to whether  or not hes lost out. 
But Im satisfied from the information its provided  that if not for the delays he wouldve 
obtained a pension transfer  value  of £68,752.29, which is £3,542.25 lower than the value he 
actually went on to achieve of £72,294.54. And, while Mr R wouldve been  able to buy more  
units with the £40,000  that he used to invest in funds following the pension  transfer, I think 
its reasonable to say that the overall benefits experienced due to the increased transfer 
value he obtained  likely  outweigh  the position he wouldve  been  in if hed been able to buy 
those sooner. Especially  when considering  these  additional units  would  only cost him just 
under £230  to buy today if he wishes, which is a fraction of the additional £3,542.25 in 
transfer value  he obtained. As well as the fact hes received just under £900 more in tax-free 
cash as a result than he would have otherwise and that hes had more funds available to 
draw down from.  
However, Avivas repeated failures  have  caused  Mr R frustration and inconvenience, 
including when it pointed  him to another  department  in its final response to answer a query 
which it later appears to have answered  for him anyway. And hes had to correspond  about a 
complaint during a difficult time as a family member has recently passed away. 
But, while Aviva made  mistakes, for the reasons Ive given above I dont think this has 
caused Mr R to lose out overall. Instead,  I think its fair to say hes in a better position than 
he wouldve otherwise been. And this means  Im not asking Aviva to do anything  further  in 
addition to paying him the £75 its already offered him as part of its final response letter. 
my final decision
For the reasons  explained I uphold Mr Rs complaint and I direct Aviva Life & Pensions UK 
Limited to pay him the £75 compensation set out in its final response  letter.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 October  2020.
