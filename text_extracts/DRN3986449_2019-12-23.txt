K821x#15Complaint
Mr R complains that Uncle Buck  Finance LLP lent money to him that he couldnt afford to 
repay.
Background
Based on the information provided by Uncle Buck  in its final response letter, it provided Mr R 
with 15 loans between  June 2012  and December 2017.

Uncle Buck  says that before the loans were  provided Mr Rs applications went through  a 
credit check  which confirmed  his monthly  income. It says it asked Mr R for his monthly 
expenditure and that based on this the loans were  affordable at the time of application. It 
also says that credit  checks were carried out which didnt raise  concerns that would have  
meant the loans shouldnt  have been provided.
Mr R says that having looked  through  his bank statements he found evidence of loans  prior 
to the June 2012 loan and he asked Uncle Buck to provide further information regarding this. 
He says that the loans he received werent  affordable and that had it checked his credit file 
Uncle Buck  would have been aware of this.
Our adjudicator initially considered the loans recorded in the table above. She thought  that 
there wasnt enough to say that loans one and two shouldnt have been provided but thought 
that further checks shouldve taken place  before  loan three. She said that had these checks 
taken place Uncle Buck would  have  realised loan three wasnt sustainably affordable.
Our adjudicator noted the gap between the loans  in 2012 and then the next loan taken out in 
November 2015  and said this meant that loan four was the start of a new lending  chain. 
Based on this she thought that there wasnt enough to say that loans four, five and six 
shouldnt have been provided but thought further checks should  have taken  place before 
loan seven and that these  would  have shown Mr R wasnt managing his money. From loan 
Ref: DRN39864492eight onwards she thought Mr Rs pattern  of borrowing showed  he was persistently reliant on 
short term lending.
Our adjudicator initially recommended that Mr Rs complaint  be upheld in regard to loans 
three, and loan seven  onwards.
Uncle Buck  responded to our adjudicators  initial view. It said its files showed the application 
for the final loan in 2012 was cancelled and that no interest or charges were applied  to this 
loan. It didnt agree that the loans  provided  from December 2016  to July 2017  were mis-sold.
In regard to the loan taken out in July 2016 it said that at that time Mr Rs income and 
expenditure were  confirmed and that he didnt  raise any concerns about repeat borrowing.  It 
said that this left the loans taken out in May 2016, October 2016 and December 2017. It 
thought the final loan shouldnt have been  provided  but offered as a resolution to the 
complaint to refund the interest and charges on all three of these loans.
Mr R didnt accept Uncle Bucks offer.
A further  review of Mr Rs complaint then took place and by another  adjudicator  who noted a 
further loan taken out in March 2012.  He said that although the loan was recorded as 
declined it was mentioned against  payment details in Uncle Bucks transaction  list and that 
Mr Rs bank statements showed a payment  of £845 on 2 May 2012 which would suggest this 
loan was provided and repaid. He thought that all four loans now recorded  for 2012 should 
be upheld.
Uncle Buck  didnt respond specifically to the new information regarding the 2012 loans but 
instead asked  for an ombudsman  to review the case.
My provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and made the following conclusions.
The loan history  information showed  the three  2012 loans that Uncle  Buck included 
in its final response.  Other loans were  recorded  from this time and earlier  however 
these were recorded as being declined. However transaction  information showed two 
2012 loans with transaction details. One of these appeared to relate to the loan taken 
out on 31 August  2012, the other was a loan taken out in March  2012. The March  
2012 loan had a repayment  amount  that related to a payment recorded  in Mr Rs 
bank statement. Therefore, while the history  information sheet said this loan was 
declined, the other  evidence  suggested it was funded. Given this I found it 
reasonable to include  this loan in my assessment.
Mr R provided  a small number of bank statements.  These showed payments that 
appeared to correlate  with loans included in the original assessment as well as the 
additional March  2012 loan. There were  then two further  payments, one for £975  on 
1 June 2012 and one for £325  on 2 April 2012. I was not able to identify from the 
information provided the loans which related  to these payments. So while  I accepted 
that further loans  may have been  provided, I didnt find that I had enough evidence to 
consider these.
I considered the following loans in my provisional decision and used the numbering  
from the following  table.

*Note, the first loan wasnt included in the initial view but identified later and then included  in 
a subsequent view to Uncle Buck. 
The loans fell into two lending chains. The first loans were  provided in 2012 and then 
there was a substantial gap after which lending  started again in November  2015.  
There were gaps  between some of the loans from November  2015  onwards however 
I didnt find that these were sufficient  to say that whatever circumstances Mr R had 
experienced before had changed.  Therefore  I found all loans from November 2015 
formed part of the second lending chain.
I did not find that I had enough to say that loans one to four shouldnt  have been 
provided.
The second lending  chain consisted  of instalment loans. I didnt think I had seen 
enough to say that the first three loans in this lending  chain  shouldnt  have been 
provided.
By the time the fourth loan was provided (loan  eight  in the current table) I thought 
further checks shouldve  taken  place. Had further  checks  been carried  out, Uncle  
Buck would have  realised that Mr R was making  use of a number of other short  term 
lenders at the same time as borrowing from it. Given this I thought Uncle  Buck would 
have realised that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr Rs situation didnt  change with the following loan (loan nine) and I thought  it 
reasonable to conclude  this was also not sustainably affordable.
By the time the sixth loan in this lending chain  had been provided  (loan  10) I thought  
it would  have been reasonable for Uncle Buck  to have realised  that Mr R was 
dependent on short term borrowing and I didnt think Uncle  Buck should have 
provided this or subsequent loans.
Ref: DRN39864494Mr R raised the question about  further  losses but I thought the fair resolution to Mr Rs 
complaint was for him to be refunded  the interest  and charges on loans eight onwards.
Mr R accepted my provisional  decision and Uncle  Buck  confirmed it had nothing  further  to 
add.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  what's  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr R could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. And there may 
even come a point where the lending history  and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans - not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
I carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information and set out my 
thoughts in my provisional decision.  In this I explained that I had included  16 loans in my 
decision and that these loans fell into two separate lending  chains.  As no further information 
was provided in response to my provisional  decision, my decision is unchanged. 
I find that I dont have enough evidence  to say that loans  one to seven shouldnt have been 
provided but I think that Uncle  Buck  should  have realised lending  from loan eight onwards  
was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN39864495my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loan eight onwards. Uncle Buck 
Finance LLP should:
A.add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr R towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans eight onwards, including payments made to a third party  where 
applicable, but not including  anything that has already  been  refunded.
B.calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr R which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr R originally made  the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C.pay Mr R the total of "A" plus "B".
D.remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Rs credit file in relation to loans eight 
and nine. The overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing for loans ten onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so these loans should be removed entirely 
from Mr Rs credit  file.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle Buck to deduct tax from this interest. It should give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax has been  deducted, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
