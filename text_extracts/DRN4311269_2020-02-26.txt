Miss B complains  she had other loans running with ECI and other  lenders and she continued  
to borrow soon after she had paid off a loan.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. ECI disagreed  with our adjudicators view and asked for 
an ombudsmans decision. ECI said it would agree to uphold  Miss Bs complaint from loan 
11 onwards. I dont think that is a fair way to resolve  the complaint  and so Ive issued this 
decision.
None of the parties has commented on loans 1 to 4 being rejected  so I wont  need to look 
at those loans  again. In this decision,  I will look at loans 5 to 11  although  I will also look at 
Miss Bs full borrowing history with ECI to assess the case  fairly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN43112692consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Miss B could sustainably  repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, I think a proportionate check for loan 5 would most likely have 
shown that Miss B was not managing  her money  well. I say this because  I think  a more 
proportionate check would have shown Miss B still had outstanding loans with ECI, overdraft 
costs, loans with other short-term lenders  and had around four credit  cards which all had 
sums owing on them   those sums ranging from £643 to over £2,000.  A more detailed check 
would have shown  these outgoings  from her declared income of £1,460 would have  reduced  
her disposable  income.  So I think a more detailed check  would  have shown she most likely 
would have had undue  difficulty to sustain loan repayments from loan 5 onwards. It follows 
that I think ECI should not have given  Miss B loan 5 onwards.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which ECI should reasonably have  seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN43112693At this point ECI ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Miss B had taken out 6 loans  within 3 months. So ECI ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss B was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Bs first loan was for £250  and loan 6 was for £100. Although the amount did 
not increase, at this point ECI ought to have known that Miss B was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed ECI. Loan 11 was 
taken out 9 months after Miss Bs first. So I think Miss B had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to ECI over an extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also going  to uphold the complaint  about loans 5 to 11 and ECI should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
A)refund  all interest, fees and charges Miss B paid on loans 5 to 11 (inclusive), 
including payments made to a third party where  applicable, but not including 
anything Elevate Credit International Limited  has already refunded.;
B)pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges 
considered part of A from the date they were paid to the date of settlement;
C)Pay Miss B the total of A plus B;
D)remove any negative payment information about loan 5 from Miss Bs credit  file;
E)the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 11 (inclusive)  should  be 
removed from Miss Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Miss B a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint  and Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as I have set out above.
Ref: DRN43112694Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 March 2020.
