The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for a timeshare trial membership. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs B entered into a trial membership agreement in May 2017 for the right to reserve 
five holiday weeks within the following three years with a timeshare company. The price of 
the trial membership was £3,995 which they paid using a loan from Shawbrook Bank. They 
signed a fixed sum loan agreement for that amount which they agreed to repay by 36 
monthly instalments of £131.36.
They complained to Shawbrook Bank in 2018 as they said that they werent aware that they 
were buying a timeshare or entering into a loan to purchase a timeshare and about the way 
that the trial membership was presented to them. They said that theyd cancelled their direct 
debit and werent going to make the payments due under the loan agreement. Shawbrook 
Bank said that theyd signed the purchase agreement and didnt cancel it during the 14 day 
cooling-off period. It issued a notice of default to Mr and Mrs B in March 2018 and their loan 
account was transferred to a third party in September 2018.
Mr and Mrs B werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
evidence available didnt appear to support their claim for a refund and she thought that 
Shawbrook Bank had fairly investigated their claim. She also thought that it had done 
enough to try and support them about their financial difficulties.
Mr and Mrs B have asked for their complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. Mrs B has 
responded in detail and has described the way that the timeshare was sold to them. She 
says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
she wants to know how much they owe to Shawbrook Bank;
they didnt receive letters from Shawbrook Bank and it sent letters to their address in 
other peoples names;
theyve not taken any services from the timeshare company;
they had to fund the flights and theyre not willing to pay for them;
Mr B lost his job in June 2017 which had a massive impact on their finances and they 
realised that they wouldnt be able to afford the flights;
until she contacted the timeshare company she had absolutely no idea that theyd 
bought a timeshare and it was mis-sold to them;
at no point did Shawbrook Bank or the timeshare company suggest reducing 
payments as a result of their financial difficulties and the only option they were 
offered was to call Shawbrook Banks arrears department; and
the whole situation was a massive trap and they were tricked into buying the 
timeshare.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the sale of a holiday membership by a timeshare company isnt an activity that this 
service can investigate directly but, in certain circumstances, section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare 
company and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Bs claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr and Mrs B entered into a trial membership agreement with the timeshare 
company in May 2017 for the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following 
three years  and they also signed the trial membership agreement conditions, a 
declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed, and a document 
containing the form of withdrawal notice;
the trial membership agreement said, immediately above their signatures, that they 
agreed:  to be bound by this Agreement and the Membership Agreement 
Conditions as stated overleaf and the Trial Membership Regulations, Rules of 
Occupation of the Club and ancillary documents  and acknowledge receipt of the 
Information Statement ;
the declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed set out 14 bullet 
points, the first of which said: We understand that we have entered into an 
Agreement for the purchase of a Trial Membership and have received a copy of our 
agreement together with its terms and conditions; and included other information 
about what had been agreed;
the right to withdraw from the agreement within 14 days was clearly set out in the 
documents that they signed and they had signed the standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given  and they had agreed that: The consumer has the right to 
withdraw from this contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason;
Mr and Mrs B also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank to 
pay for the trial membership, it was clearly described as a fixed sum loan agreement 
and said that the goods and services that were being financed were Timeshare 
weeks and, immediately above their signatures, the agreement said This is a Credit 
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms - and their right to withdraw from the loan agreement was 
also clearly set out;
Mr and Mrs B had the right to withdraw from the trial membership agreement within 
the first 14 days but they didnt exercise that right and they didnt complain to 
Shawbrook Bank or the timeshare company about their issues with the product until 
November 2017 which was nearly six months after theyd signed the agreements;
Ive carefully considered Mrs Bs description of the way that the timeshare was sold 
to them, together with this services understanding of the sales processes that were often used, but I consider that it was clear enough from the documents that Mr and 
Mrs B signed that they were buying the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the 
following three years with the timeshare company and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the trial membership was misrepresented to them or 
that they were induced into entering into the trial membership agreement by a 
misrepresentation made by the timeshare company;
Mrs B says that they havent taken any services from the timeshare company, 
including the introductory holiday that was offered to them, but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that the timeshare company said that it would provide flights for that holiday, 
or any of the other holidays that were available under the trial membership 
agreement, and I consider that the holidays were available to Mr and Mrs B but it was 
their decision not to use them and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres been a breach of contract by the timeshare company in these 
circumstances;
Ive also considered whether there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs B 
and Shawbrook Bank in these arrangements as section 140A of the Consumer Credit 
Act gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any 
sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs B and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances and I consider it be unlikely 
that a court would find that the relationship was unfair;
Mr and Mrs B stopped making payments to Shawbrook Bank in November 2017 so 
their account went into arrears  Shawbrook Bank has provided copies of 24 letters 
that it sent to Mr and Mrs B about their account between then and May 2018 when 
the account was defaulted  those letters were correctly addressed though Mrs B 
says that they werent received but I consider it to be more likely than not that the 
letters were sent by Shawbrook Bank and Im not persuaded that its likely that none 
of the letters was received;
I consider that it was clear from those letters that Mr and Mrs B should contact 
Shawbrook Bank to discuss their financial situation  for example one of the letters 
that was sent to them in November 2017 said: If you are experiencing financial 
difficulties, there are a number of ways in which we may be able to help, so please 
do not hesitate to get in touch; and the contact details for its customer management 
team were provided;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs B properly explained their financial 
difficulties to Shawbrook Bank and it transferred their loan account to a third party in 
September 2018 when the outstanding balance on their account was £3,519.62;
I suggest that Mr and Mrs B contact the third party to discuss their debt and it will be 
able to provide them with the current amount of the debt  if they dont do so I 
consider it to be likely that the third party will take further action against them, to the 
extent that its legally entitled to do so, to try to recover the debt from them  but the 
third party is required to respond to any financial difficulties that theyre experiencing 
positively and sympathetically;
Mrs B has provided a letter that was sent to her address by Shawbrook Bank but 
which relates to another customer  that was clearly an error by Shawbrook Bank but 
that didnt form part of Mr and Mrs Bs complaint to Shawbrook Bank and this service 
so Im unable to consider that issue as part of this complaint  if they now want to 
complain about that issue I suggest that they contact the Information Commissioners 
Office;its clear that Mrs B feels strongly that shes been treated unfairly by the timeshare 
company and Shawbrook Bank and I sympathise with her and Mr B for the issues 
that theyve had with the timeshare company and Shawbrook Bank and their financial 
difficulties, but I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mr and Mrs Bs claim 
was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to 
refund to Mr and Mrs B any of the money that theyve paid for the trial membership, 
to write-off all or any part of their debt, to pay them any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
