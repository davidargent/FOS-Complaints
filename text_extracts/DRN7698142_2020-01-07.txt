K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent Mr L and Sunny  my provisional  decision  on this complaint on 17 December 2019. A 
copy of it is attached and forms part of this final decision. I explained why I was planning to 
uphold the complaint in part and asked both parties  to let me know if they had anything to 
add.
Sunny didnt send  me anything else to consider. Mr L raised a number of points, including:
asking whether Id taken the bank statements hed provided into account and;
saying that the pattern of lending  suggested he wasnt repaying his loans sustainably 
at a point earlier  loan 16, the point I had identified  and that the complaint should be 
upheld from at least loan 10 onwards
As Mr L didnt accept my provisional decision,  the case  was returned to me for further 
consideration.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the remaining points  of disagreement are those  raised by Mr L (as summarised above), 
Ill focus on those  here.  The parties can refer to my attached provisional decision in respect 
of the other aspects  of Mr Ls complaint.
Id like to start by reassuring Mr L that I did take into account all of the information  provided 
by both parties, including his bank  statements. Although the bank statements are relevant 
information Ive considered  because they provide an informative picture of Mr Ls financial 
situation  its not necessarily the case that Sunny  ought to have asked Mr L for this sort of 
information. 
In Mr Ls particular case, I wouldnt have expected Sunny to ask him for proof  of income  and 
expenditure (which  might  include  providing bank statements) for most of the period covering 
loans 1 to 15. I do think  its arguable that after loan 10, Sunny perhaps should have been  
asking for this sort of information   as there were clearer indications at this point that Mr L 
might not have been repaying the loans in a sustainable manner  so more  thorough  
affordability checks may have been proportionate.
Mr Ls bank statements (e.g. for November-December 2017) do show he was borrowing 
from a number of other lenders  and a reliance on high-cost  credit  to manage day-to-day  
expenditure may point towards the type of financial difficulty which hasnt simply arisen  from 
a short-term cashflow  problem. At the same time, I dont think  the bank statements 
necessarily show that the loans  granted in this period were not sustainably  affordable,  taking 
into account what I can see of Mr Ls income  and expenditure. So while  Mr L may have been  
in some financial difficulty, I dont think theres  enough evidence  to say the lending  during 
this period was actually  irresponsible.
Ref: DRN76981422I can understand Mr Ls point when he talks about  the pattern of lending in the way he has. 
Mr L has mentioned that loan 5 (which was for £500) was needed following his repayments 
of loans 1 to 4 (which  were cumulatively for £400). He also says loans 6 to 10 were taken 
out as a consequence of loan 5.
I dont dispute  that Mr Ls interpretation of the pattern of borrowing is reasonable. Its quite 
possible that he was borrowing  to cover the hole repaying earlier loans had left in his 
finances from a point earlier than that which I have identified. But this isnt necessarily the 
only reason Mr L might  have needed  to borrow regularly  and I think  in the earlier stages of 
the lending its reasonable that the lender be given the benefit of the doubt. That still leaves 
the subjective question of at what point the lender should no longer have that benefit and I 
can appreciate why Mr L thinks this ought  to have been earlier than loan 16. But I do not 
think the point  I identified in my provisional decision was unreasonable,  bearing in mind  all 
the relevant factors,  including the amounts borrowed relative  to his income, the length of the 
chain of borrowing  up to that point (around six months)  and all the other relevant factors.
For these reasons, Ive not been  persuaded to depart from my provisional findings and Im 
upholding Mr Ls complaint in part, in respect of loans 16 to 34.
putting things right
Sunny should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 16 to 34
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from the date Mr L paid the interest 
and charges until the date of settlement
Sunny should  also remove  loans 16 to 34 from Mr Ls credit report entirely, as the number of 
loans provided  from this point onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN76981423my final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part. Elevate Credit International Limited must  put things right by 
taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2020.

complaint
Mr L says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr L had 34 loans with Sunny. Ive summarised  some of the information Sunny provided about  the 
loans in an appendix to this decision.
Our adjudicator considered  Mr Ls complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt think  
Sunny shouldve  agreed to loans 6 to 34. Sunny  didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint 
was passed to me to decide. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr L could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr L 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ref: DRN76981425Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
In its response to the adjudicator, Sunny conceded that it ought to have realised that  at a certain  
point  it ought to have asked further questions about Mr Ls requests  to borrow. It acknowledged 
there were no significant breaks in the borrowing  and that Mr L had asked to borrow again on the 
same day as repaying certain loans.  So I think Sunny broadly accepts the approach  our adjudicator  
took to assessing Mr Ls complaint  but it disagreed with him about the point at which it was clear Mr 
L wasnt  using  the loans  as intended. Sunny didnt accept that this point arose  at loan 6 but made an 
offer from loan 23 onwards   the point at which  Mr L had been borrowing  for about one year.
Ive looked afresh at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 16. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mr L was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr L had taken out 15 loans within six months and the cumulative amounts Mr L 
was borrowing (taking into account the overlapping loans) was, by loan 16, clearly not 
decreasing. Mr L repaid  loan 15 on 11 February  having repaid four other loans earlier in the 
same month  and then asked for loan 16 just six days later. So Sunny  ought to have realised 
it was more likely than not Mr L was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
From loan 16 onwards it was clear that Sunny was providing Mr L with a new loan within  days 
or weeks of settling  a previous one. So Sunny ought to have  realised, as it has 
acknowledged, that Mr L wasnt using these loans for their intended short-term  purpose.
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loans 24 to 30 and 31 to 
34 (many  of which overlapped)  were  taken out over a year after Mr Ls first and during  this 
period the maximum  amount of principal Mr L typically  owed was £600 to £750  much more 
than he initially borrowed.  So Mr L had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ive also seen  Mr Ls bank statement from the time of loan 16. Ive seen that he was borrowing from 
and/or repaying around five other payday or short-term  lenders at this time, providing further evidence 
that he was in a pattern  of relying on unsustainable high-cost debt to meet  his regular  outgoings. Had 
Sunny carried  out proportionate checks, I think its likely it wouldve been aware of this too. 
I think  that Mr L lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from loan 16 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans Mr L borrowed  was likely to have  had negative implications on his ability 
to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im planning to uphold Mr Ls complaint about loans  16 to 34.
