The complaint
Mr L has complained about a number of loans he took from Gain Credit LLC whilst trading 
as Lending Stream (Gain Credit' or the lender). Mr L says Gain Credit lent to 
him irresponsibly.  
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr L was given 13 loans by Gain Credit between June 2012 and May 2019. The loans were 
all instalment loans to be repaid over five or six months. The principal sum borrowed varied 
from £100 to £600.  
A summary of Mr L's borrowing is as follows: 
LoanDate Taken Amount Instalments
1 14-Jun-12 £215.00 6
2 21-Jun-12 £175.00 5
3 26-Aug-12 £255.00 6
4 15-Feb-13 £175.00 5

In my provisional decision I explained why I thought the complaint should be partly upheld. 
DRN-1930532Gain Credit had told Mr L that it was upholding his complaint about loan 2 and had offered to 
pay him compensation in line with our approach. So I didnt need to consider loan 2 any 
further.
I explained that, given the 5-year gap between loans 4 and 5, I think this represented a clean 
break in lending as the gap was such that Gain Credit might reasonably have considered 
any problems that had led Mr L to take the first four loans had been resolved. So I 
approached loans 1 to 4 and loans 5 to 13 as two separate chains of lending. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
Gain Credit needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I thought that the checks that Gain Credit carried out for loans 1, 3 and 4 were proportionate. 
So I didnt think there was any reason why the lender should have declined these 
applications.  
I thought the checks that Gain Credit carried out for loans 5 to 8 were also likely to have 
been reasonable and proportionate - given the amount it was lending to Mr L each time, in 
comparison with his income, and the number of loans agreed at this point in the new 
lending relationship. So I didnt think there was any reason why the lender should have 
declined these applications either.   
I didnt think Gain Credit should have agreed to loan 9 without doing more a more thorough 
check of Mr Ls financial circumstances. But without additional information, I couldnt say 
what better checks by the lender would have shown at the time. From the evidence 
presented, I couldnt fairly say that Gain Credit shouldnt have given loan 9 to Mr L or that it 
lent to him irresponsibly. So I didnt intend to uphold the complaint about loan 9, as I hadn't 
seen enough evidence to say that better checks in respect of this loan would have led to it 
being declined.
But I didnt think Gain Credit should have agreed to provide loans 10 to13.
 
By loan 10 Mr L had multiple loans open with Gain Credit. It was his sixth loan in just over 
seven months and he wasnt significantly decreasing or reducing the amount he was 
borrowing. I thought that it should have been clear to Gain Credit that Mr L was no longer 
borrowing to meet a short-term, emergency need, but that he was most likely now borrowing 
to keep up with his ongoing financial commitments. So as a responsible lender, Gain Credit 
should have reasonably questioned whether it should continue to offer further short-term 
loans to this consumer, whose repeated borrowing suggested that hed become reliant on 
the lending - which the rules and guidance made clear should only be for a short-term 
purpose. I thought that by agreeing to loans 10 to 13, Gain Credit was effectively prolonging 
Mr Ls indebtedness, by allowing him to take expensive credit over an extended period of 
time. 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Mr Ls CMC has told us 
it has nothing further to add. Gain Credit has confirmed it has received my provisional 
decision but Ive not seen any further comment or response from them about it.
 
What Ive decided  and whyIve once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Mr L has nothing further to add, and Ive not received any further evidence or 
comment from Gain Credit, I confirm the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint about loans 1, 3, 4 or loans 5 to 9.
Gain Credit has upheld Mr Ls complaint about loan 2, taken on 21st June 2012 and it should 
pay him compensation as set out below.
I dont think Gain Credit should have given Mr L the loans he took on 16th October 2018, 5th 
January 2019, 10th March 2019 or 29th May 2019 (loans 10 to 13). 
So Gain Credit should: 
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr L on loans 2 and 10 to 13;
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the
date they were paid to the date of settlement. HM Revenue and Customs requires
Gain Credit to take tax off this interest. Gain Credit must give Mr L a certificate
showing how much tax its deducted if he asks for one; and
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation loan 2.
The number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 to 13  should be removed from
Mr Ls credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ls complaint and direct Gain Credit LLC to put 
things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2020.
