The complaint
Mr K complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Blue Motor Finance Limited was misrepresented to him. 
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr K under a hire purchase agreement with Blue Motor Finance 
that he electronically signed in December 2019. He said that the car was advertised with a 
full service history but he didnt receive its service history so he complained to Blue Motor 
Finance. He wasnt satisfied with its response so he complained to this service and he 
stopped making the monthly payments under the agreement.
Our investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
there was a misrepresentation made to Mr K but hed used the car without making the 
monthly payments to Blue Motor Finance. She recommended that Blue Motor Finance 
should: allow Mr K to reject the car and unwind the agreement; refund his deposit (with 
interest) less the monthly payments he owes to reflect the usage hes had of the car; arrange 
to collect the car once Mr K had paid for the usage; amend his credit file accordingly; and 
pay Mr K £200 for the distress and inconvenience the matter has caused.
Blue Motor Finance has accepted those recommendations but Mr K doesnt agree that he 
should be paying anything to Blue Motor Finance. He says that:
he requested the service history from the start and at no point did the dealer attempt 
to provide it or offer a solution;
he visited a manufacturers dealer to check the cars service history and was given a 
record with only two services - and he says that he was told that it should have been 
sold to him for at least £3,500 less;
if hed been told that the car didnt have a complete service history, he wouldnt have 
taken it as there were other cars with full service histories available; and
due to on-going issues he had to park the car for several months and he then had to 
buy a new battery and a warning light for the auxiliary battery is showing.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the advert for the car refers to S/H and I consider it to be more likely than not that 
that refers to service history;
Mr K also signed the dealers invoice which says that the car had a full service 
history;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Mr K wasnt provided with a full service 
history for the car and information from the manufacturers dealer shows that it hasnt 
been serviced in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations  so I 
consider it to be more likely than not that the cars service history was 
misrepresented to Mr K;
Mr K says that he wouldnt have agreed for the car to be supplied to him and wouldnt 
have entered into the hire purchase agreement if he hadnt been told that the car had 
a full service history  and I consider it to be more likely than not that he was induced 
into entering into the hire purchase agreement by the misrepresentation;
Blue Motor Finance now accepts that Mr K can reject the car and I consider that to 
be fair and reasonable  so I find that it should collect the car from him;
the invoice for the car shows that its price was £11,950 and that Mr K part-
exchanged a car which had a value of £1,500 so the amount of credit provided to him 
was £10,450  but the hire purchase agreement shows that the price of the car was 
£12,450 and that the value of the car that he part-exchanged was £2,000 so the 
amount of credit was £10,450  I consider the invoice to be more reliable evidence of 
the price of the car and the value of the car that Mr K part-exchanged;
Mr K has used the car since December 2019, other than for the period when he says 
it was parked, and he provided evidence in September 2020 to show that its mileage 
was 104,616  the invoice for the car shows that the cars mileage when it was 
supplied to Mr K was 99,825 so hes used the car to drive more than 4,791 miles;
Mr K stopped making the monthly payments that were agreed in the hire purchase 
agreement and, although I can understand the frustration that he feels about the car 
being misrepresented to him, Im not persuaded that he had any right to stop making 
those payments;
I consider that its fair and reasonable that he should pay for the use that hes had 
from the car and that Blue Motor Finance should receive the monthly payments that 
he agreed to make to it as payment for that use; 
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Blue Motor 
Finance to waive or reduce the amount that its owed by Mr K for the monthly 
payments that are due under that agreement;
I consider that it would be fair and reasonable for Blue Motor Finance to refund to 
Mr K the deposit of £1,500,with interest, but it says that the amount that he owes to it 
is larger than that refund - so I find that it should deduct the deposit refund, with 
interest, from the monthly payments that its owed by Mr K;
Mr K will then owe the outstanding balance to Blue Motor Finance and, if he doesnt 
contact it to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for that amount, I consider it 
to be likely that it will take action to recover that amount from him, to the extent that 
its legally entitled to do so;
when Mr K has paid the outstanding balance to Blue Motor Finance, I find that it 
should then end the hire purchase agreement and amend his credit file to show that 
the agreement has been ended;
these events have clearly caused distress and inconvenience for Mr K and I find that 
it would be fair and reasonable for Blue Motor Finance to pay (not credit) £200 to him 
to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience (and its for him to decide 
whether or not to use that payment to reduce his outstanding balance.
Putting things right
I find that Blue Motor Finance should allow Mr K to reject the car and to take the other 
actions described above  and it has agreed to do so.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ks complaint and I order Blue Motor Finance Limited:
1. To arrange for the car to be collected from Mr K at no cost to him.
2. When it has received the outstanding amount due from Mr K for his monthly 
payments - to end the hire purchase agreement and to amend his credit file to 
show that the agreement has ended. 
3. Pay £200 to Mr K to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2021.
