The complaint
V, a limited company complains about the process used by National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) to open a new bank account.
V is represented in its complaint by Mr K.
What happened
In early 2023, V wanted to open a business bank account with NatWest. After making the 
application, Mr K was unhappy to receive a text giving him three hours to submit the required 
documentation or his invitation to submit the documents would expire. As Mr K couldnt meet 
the deadline due to waiting for statements from Vs existing bank, he had to restart the 
application process. Mr K says the first time he was aware of NatWests strict policy on 
returning documents was when he received the text.
NatWest says that once a customer submits its application, NatWest sends an email which 
says documents should be submitted within seven to ten working days. If the customer 
doesnt return documents within the specified timeframe, NatWest then cancels the 
application.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Vs complaint be upheld. In summary, he thought V 
should have been aware that documents would need to be returned within seven to ten 
working days well before it received the three hour warning text. 
Overall, our investigator didnt think NatWest was responsible for any delays with Vs 
application which was successful on the third attempt. Our investigator also noted that Vs 
second application wasnt made immediately following the rejection of the first application 
and that the second application was also not accepted  indicating that V was responsible 
for the delays. 
Mr K didnt accept the investigation outcome and said he didnt understand the investigators 
comments on the second application. 
Our investigator clarified his view by explaining that NatWest had provided evidence that 
once the deadline for submitting the documents for the first application expired, V waited 
almost two weeks to make the second application. Our investigator thought this indicated 
that V didnt have an urgent need for the business account. 
Our investigator accepted that Mr K may not have been aware of the deadline when first 
submitting Vs application but this didnt mean that NatWest didnt mention the deadline 
when responding to Vs application.
Mr K responded to say that hes never referred to any sense of urgency in Vs complaint. Mr 
K says the complaint concerns the three hours notice he received, after which time the 
application had to be restarted from scratch. Mr K says it wasnt possible to simply resume 
the application as V had changed address and needed to wait for the next statement cycle 
so that the statement would show Vs new address.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful to Mr K for his clarification of Vs complaint. He was unhappy to receive a text 
message giving him only three hours to submit the application. Mr K doesnt think this was 
fair and it meant he had to make a fresh application.
Im sorry to hear about Mr Ks frustration with NatWests account opening process but for me 
to find that NatWest should do anything in response to Vs complaint  I would have to be 
persuaded that NatWest made a mistake in the handling of Vs account application.
Overall, Im not persuaded that NatWest has done anything wrong. It has provided evidence 
to show that when V first submitted its application, V would have been sent an email stating 
that all required documents need to be provided within 7  10 working days for the 
application to be processed without delay. So, I cant reasonably find that NatWest didnt 
make V aware of the deadline for providing information. This means I dont consider it was 
unreasonable for NatWest to message V shortly before the deadline was due to expire. And 
I dont find NatWest treated V unfairly when it asked it to restart the application process. 
As I dont consider NatWest made a mistake which led V to having to resubmit its account 
application, I dont require NatWest to apologise or pay compensation for any of the resulting 
inconvenience caused to V.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask V to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 November 2023.
