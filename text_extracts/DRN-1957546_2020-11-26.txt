The complaint
Mr M complains that  Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont refund to 
him the money that was paid for a stay in some overseas accommodation.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M had used his Tesco Bank credit card to pre-authorise a stay at the 
accommodation in May 2019 but when he arrived there he says that it wasnt as 
described so he chose to stay somewhere else;
he phoned Tesco Bank to check whether a payment had been made to the 
accommodation provider  but none was showing on his account and it was agreed 
that his card would be blocked so that a future payment couldnt be collected by the 
accommodation provider;
but the accommodation provider was able to activate the pre-authorisation and it 
collected a payment of £613.41 from Mr Ms account;
he complained to Tesco Bank and it upheld his complaint  it apologised that it hadnt 
made clear to Mr M that because a pre-authorisation had been made the 
accommodation provider might still be able to debit his account even if the card was 
blocked  and it offered to pay him £50 compensation, which I understand was later 
increased to £100;
Mr M then complained to this service and our investigator thought that the apology 
and offer of £100 compensation was fair and reasonable in the circumstances  he 
didnt think that a chargeback claim for the payment wouldve been successful and 
he wasnt convinced that there had been a breach of contract or a misrepresentation 
so he didnt think that Tesco Bank had acted unfairly by not making a claim under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
the booking confirmation for the accommodation clearly says that a full charge would 
be made if the booking was cancelled on the day that the booking started and the 
accommodation provider used the pre-authorisation that had been made by Mr M to 
collect a payment of £613.41  so Im not persuaded that there was a breach of 
contract about the payment;
its clear from Mr Ms call to Tesco Bank that he wanted to stop a payment being 
collected by the accommodation provider and it accepts that it should have told him 
that a payment might still be collected even though it wasnt showing on his account 
and his card was blocked  but if hed been given that information I dont consider 
that he would have been able to stop the payment;
Im not persuaded that there was a reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim for 
the payment being successful in these circumstances because the accommodation 
provider had collected the payment in accordance with the terms of the booking 
confirmation;
Mr M clearly didnt consider the accommodation to be as described and he chose to 
stay elsewhere  and I sympathise with him for the frustration and disappointment 
that that will have caused him  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation about the 
accommodation so I dont consider that Tesco Banks response to his claim under 
section 75 has been unfair or unreasonable;
I also sympathise with Mr M that hes paid for accommodation that he chose not to 
use and for the issues that he has with the information that he was given by Tesco 
Bank  but I consider that Tesco Banks apology and the £100 compensation that it 
says its paid to him is a fair and reasonable response to those issues; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Tesco Bank to refund the payment of £613.41 to Mr Ms account, to pay him 
any more compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 December 2020.
