The complaint
Company N is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed its current account 
and started pursuing it for a loan after years of no contact. Company N would like the loan 
written off and to be reimbursed for losses suffered. 
What happened
Before I begin, I should point out that this complaint is regarding accounts belonging to a 
limited company, Company N. The loan in question had a personal guarantor attached. I 
wont be considering anything in relation to the personal guarantor under this complaint. 
Company N took out a loan for Â£35,000 in May 2017 to pay for refurbishments to a shop it 
owns. Company N says that shortly after this, in August 2017, it couldnt get access to its 
current account and was told this was to be closed. Company N says it wasnt given a 
reason for this decision.
Company N says it took three to four weeks for a new account to be opened with a different 
bank. The new account was opened around mid-September 2017. Company N says the 
account closure led to a loss of turnover for the business and a great deal of inconvenience. 
Company N says it tried to contact NatWest about the loan. However, NatWest kept saying it 
couldnt locate the account. It wasnt until March 2019 that Company N says it heard from 
NatWest in relation to the loan account, receiving a letter addressed to the company. This is 
when they found out it had been defaulted. 
Company N says NatWest had been writing to the directors home address (which used to 
be Company Ns registered address on Companies House). However, the director had 
moved from there in 2016. Company N says NatWest was aware of its shop address, as this 
is where the NatWest advisor had visited when Company N applied for its accounts. And so, 
it says NatWest shouldve been writing to that address. 
Company N provided a copy of its current account statement which had been sent to the 
shop address in 2017. It also provided a letter regarding the cancellation of their credit card 
in 2017, which was also sent to the shop address. Company N says this is further evidence 
NatWest had the correct address and shouldve been sending letters there. 
Company N complained to NatWest that it hadnt given it a reason for why it had closed the 
current account. It was unhappy that NatWests actions had caused it to owe more than it 
should and so wanted the debt written off. 
NatWest explained it had complied with its legal and regulatory obligations when closing the 
current account, and having reviewed the decision, was not willing to reconsider.  
NatWest says Company N made three payments towards the loan, but then fell into arrears 
in September 2017, prior to the current account closing. It says it wrote to Company N at the 
address it had registered on its system  this being the directors previous home address. It 
pointed out that despite Company N saying it moved from that address in 2016, this was the 
address detailed on the loan agreement signed in May 2017. 
NatWest says it sent three letters in December 2018 about the arrears on the loan account, 
as well as attempting to text the number it held on the system (this being the same number 
Company Ns director uses now). As no response was received, it issued a formal demand 
on 7 January 2019, and subsequently the account was sent to its recovery department on 24 
January 2019. NatWest has since sold the loan debt.  
NatWest pointed out that it had been writing to the address it held on the system (the 
directors old address) and it was Company Ns responsibility to update its address. 
In response to Company N saying it received statements for the current account to the shop 
address, as well as correspondence about the credit card account, NatWest explained that it 
is possible to have a separate address on the system for current account statements. This is 
very common for business accounts, as quite often a business will want their statements 
sent elsewhere, such as to their accountant. Although NatWest cant provide any evidence 
due to the passage of time, it says this is likely why Company N was receiving its current 
account statements to the shop address. It also explained that the credit card account is 
administered on a separate system to the current account and loan account. Therefore, it 
seems Company N had given the updated address for the credit card, but not the current 
and loan accounts. 
Company N brought its complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold the 
complaint. She concluded that NatWest had closed Company Ns current account correctly, 
in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and terms and conditions of the account. She 
said a notice to close was sent in July 2017 and the account was closed in October 2017. 
The investigator also concluded NatWest had been contacting Company N at the address it 
held on file regarding the loan. There was no indication Company N had ever updated the 
address to the shop address, for anything other than statements. As no payments had been 
made towards the loan since August 2017, NatWest hadnt made an error in the actions it 
had taken. She noted that Company N still hasnt made any repayments towards the loan, 
despite receiving NatWests letter in March 2019.  
The investigator also pointed out that Company N didnt change its registered address to the 
shop address on Companies House until July 2017. It had changed it from the directors 
home address (the one held on NatWests system) in February 2017 to a different address, 
and this was then updated again to the shop address in July 2017. 
Company N disagreed. It reemphasised the director had moved from the address NatWest 
held in 2016. It explained that there was a postal redirect in place, and it didnt receive any 
post to that address, so dont believe NatWest sent any letters. It explained that NatWest 
had sent other correspondence to the shop address, it just hadnt kept copies of these. 
NatWest had attended the shop to do the account applications and so they assumed it had 
the shop address. The director of Company N said he didnt read the loan agreement before 
signing, as he was rushed and distracted that day by the building work at the shop and 
assumed the advisor wouldve done it correctly. That is why he didnt notice the old address 
was on the loan agreement. 
Because Company N disagreed, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my review of the evidence has led me to the same overall conclusions as
the investigator previously set out and for much the same reasons.
Current account closure 
NatWest has a wide range of legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing
account services to its customers. These are ongoing so dont just apply at account opening
stage. To comply with these obligations, it may need to review accounts and the activity
taking place on them. Sometimes these reviews will lead to the accounts being closed.  If 
NatWest didnt do this, it could risk serious sanction.
Having reviewed whats happened, Im satisfied NatWest was entitled to close
Company Ns account and did so in in line with the account terms and relevant regulations. 
NatWest has the discretion to offer accounts to who it wishes, just as Company N can 
choose who to bank with.
NatWest says it gave Company N 60 days notice of the account closure by writing to them 
on 26 July 2017 at their registered address. Company N says they didnt get this letter  they 
had moved from the address NatWest held in 2016. However, regardless of whether this 
letter was received, Company Ns director says he was aware of the imminent account 
closure in August 2017 and had opened a new account elsewhere by mid-September 2017. 
The NatWest account wasnt closed until October 2017 and was being used by Company N 
up to this point. So, Im satisfied Company N had notice of the closure and was able to move 
their banking elsewhere before the NatWest account was closed. 
Given Im satisfied NatWest was entitled to close the account, and Company N was on 
notice of this, it follows that whilst I accept this caused Company N a great deal of 
inconvenience, I wont be recommending NatWest pay any compensation. 
Loan account 
Company N doesnt dispute that it took out the loan. Ultimately, it is their responsibility to 
maintain payments towards it. 
Company N says it tried to speak to NatWest about the loan when their current account was 
closed. However, the loan account couldnt be located. NatWest has said its possible the 
branch may not have been able to locate the account if Company N didnt have the account 
number/sort code for the loan or wasnt able to provide the company information. Its possible 
Company N may not have kept any paperwork with the loan details on (although I note this 
was only taken out a few months prior), but it shouldve been able to supply information 
about the company itself. Company N had its current account statements showing the loan 
payments being made, so Im satisfied that had it pursued this properly, the loan account 
wouldve been located. 
In any event, regardless of this, NatWest did continue to communicate with Company N 
about the loan. 
NatWest has provided its system notes to show that it dispatched three letters in December 
2018 regarding the loan arrears. In addition, the notes show a formal demand was issued on 
7 January 2019. Company N says it didnt receive these letters as NatWest sent these to an 
old address. Having reviewed NatWests system notes, Im satisfied that it had the directors home 
address recorded on its systems as the main correspondence address for both the loan and 
current account. But Im also satisfied, based on the evidence Company N has provided, that 
NatWest must have also had the shop address recorded for the current account. NatWest 
cant evidence this due to the passage of time, but the evidence it can supply around the 
main correspondence address, suggests that the shop address was recorded for statement 
purposes only, and only in relation to the current account. Both the main address and 
statement address for the loan account was recorded as the company directors old address.   
Company N has said it assumed NatWest had the shop address as it had attended the 
premises to carry out the applications. Unfortunately, this wasnt the case though. It would 
be for Company N to update the address held by NatWest, rather than assume this had 
been done, or assume NatWest had recorded it as its main address. Whilst I appreciate 
Company N says it did receive other correspondence to the shop address, it hasnt been 
able to show any evidence of this beyond the current account statement and credit card 
letter. So, based on the evidence I do have, Im not persuaded Company N ever let NatWest 
know that it should be sending all correspondence for both the current account and loan, to 
the shop address. 
It follows that Im satisfied NatWest sent the letters regarding the outstanding loan to the 
address it held on file for Company N, and it cant be held responsible for the fact these 
werent received. 
Given there is no dispute that Company N took out the loan, and Im satisfied NatWest 
attempted to contact it about the arrears, I dont agree NatWest has made any mistakes in 
the actions its taken. Company N was responsible for making payments towards the loan 
and I can see no justification for it being written off or compensation paid. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Company Ns complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Company N to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 December 2020.
