The complaint
Miss H complains that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional sale agreement 
with Moneybarn No. 1 Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss H under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
she electronically signed in August 2019. The car broke down later that month and the 
exhaust gas recirculation valve was replaced, which was paid for by the dealer. 
Miss H says that the engine management warning light came on in December 2019 and an 
injector was then replaced in January 2020. The car broke down again later that month so 
Miss H complained to Moneybarn. It arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent 
expert in January 2020. The inspection report concluded that there was a fault with the cars 
turbo but that, on the balance of probability, the car wouldnt have been in that condition 
when it was supplied to Miss H. 
Moneybarn didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint so she complained to this service. Miss H paid 
for the turbo to be replaced in May 2020 and another injector to be replaced in June 2020. 
The cars exhaust gas recirculation valve failed again in July 2020 and Miss H paid for it to 
be replaced.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Miss Hs complaint should be upheld. He thought 
that the car was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss H so he didnt think that 
it would be fair to ask Moneybarn to do anything more to resolve her complaint. 
Miss H has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that the 
car broke down soon after she got it and other things went wrong with it in the first six 
months of having it. She also says that she wasnt able to use the car between January and 
May 2020 because of the fault with the turbo.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss H - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss H was about three years old, had been driven for 
85,287 miles and had a price of £7,840;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
its clear that there was a fault with the cars exhaust gas recirculation valve soon 
after the car was supplied to Miss H so the valve was replaced  that cost £235.64 
which was paid for by the dealer; 
that repair seems to have dealt with the issue because Miss H was able to use the 
car and Ive seen no evidence to show that she had any further issues with it until 
January 2020  I consider that the replacement valve was an appropriate response 
to the issue at that time;
an injector was replaced in January 2020 and the car broke down later that month;
Miss H complained to Moneybarn and it arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert  the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 87,641 and 
said that there was a fault with the cars turbo which required further investigation but 
said: We consider on the balance of probability that the vehicle would not have been 
in this condition at finance inception and therefore the faults would not be considered 
the liability of the selling agent;
Moneybarn didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint and she says that she didnt use the car 
until May 2020 when she paid for the turbo to be replaced;
she paid for another injector to be replaced in June 2020 and then paid £324.92 for 
the exhaust gas recirculation valve to be replaced again in July 2020;
the independent experts report concludes that its more likely than not that the fault 
with the cars turbo wasnt present when the car was supplied to Miss H and I dont 
consider that shed have been able to use the car to drive about 2,350 miles in five 
months if the fault with the turbo had been present when the car was supplied to her 
 so I consider it to be more likely than not that the fault with the turbo developed 
after the car was supplied to Miss H;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the exhaust gas 
recirculation valve had to be replaced again in July 2020 because of an issue with 
the car that was present when the car was supplied to Miss H  I consider it to be 
more likely than not that the valve needed to be replaced as a result of the other 
issues that Miss H has had with the car;
the car had passed an MOT test in August 2019 before it was supplied to Miss H and 
it passed another MOT test in July 2020 with no advisories;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss H in August 2019; 
I sympathise with Miss H for all of the issues that shes had with the car and for the 
repair costs that shes incurred  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to reimburse her for those costs;
Miss H says that the car was driven to her in August 2019 when she was expecting it 
be delivered to her on a loader  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that it had been agreed that the car would be delivered to her on a loader;
Miss H says that she found out that the car had been used as a hire car  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the dealer misrepresented the 
car to her or that it was required to tell her that it had been used as a hire car; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Moneybarn has acted 
incorrectly in its dealing with Miss H about the car; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Moneybarn to allow Miss H to reject the car, to reimburse her for any of the repair costs that shes incurred, to pay her any other compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
