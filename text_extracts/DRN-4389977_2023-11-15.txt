The complaint
Mr and Mrs J are unhappy with how AWP P&C SA settled a claim they made on their travel 
insurance policy.  
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The relevant rules and industry guidelines say that AWP has a responsibility to handle 
claims promptly and fairly. And they shouldnt reject a claim unreasonably. 
The policy terms and conditions set out the cover for damaged baggage. The terms say: 
We will pay you up to £2,500 (in the event of point 1 above) to:
Replace, reinstate or repair your baggage. Claims will be considered on a 
new for old basis provided the item is less than 2 years old at the date of the 
incident and you can provide the original purchase receipt. All other items will 
be subject to a suitable deduction for wear and tear and depreciation or we 
may at our option replace, reinstate or repair the lost, stolen or damaged 
baggage. 
Im satisfied that AWP has settled Mr and Mrs Js claim fairly and in line with the policy terms 
because: 
Mr and Mrs J say that they purchased the bag for £400 over ten years ago. 
So, as the item was over two years old, there was no requirement for AWP to 
replace it on a new for old basis. 
AWP has applied a deduction for wear and tear in line with the policy terms. 
I dont think the deduction AWP has applied is unreasonable. Im satisfied its 
a fair and reasonable reduction, taking into account the age of the item.  
My final decision
Im not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J and Mr J to 
accept or reject my decision before 13 December 2023.
