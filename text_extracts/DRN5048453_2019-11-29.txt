K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly  lent 
to him. 
Mr C said Sunny didnt carry out all the checks  it shouldve  done before lending to him  and 
if it had, it wouldve realised that he was reliant on the loans and couldnt afford to pay them 
in a sustainable manner.
background
Sunny provided  Mr C with 13 loans  over a 10 month period  he took out the first loan in 
October 2017 and the last loan in August  2018.  All the loans were  due to run for around  
6 months and they ranged in amount between £50 and £250. I understand that all the loans 
have been settled. 
Theres a table at the end of my decision setting out details of the loans.
When Mr C complained to Sunny, it agreed  it shouldnt have lent Mr C loan 13. Sunny  
offered to refund the interest hed paid for this loan (plus  interest on that amount) and also to 
amend information  on Mr Cs credit file.
Our adjudicator didnt  think this went far enough to put things right for Mr C. She thought  
loans 5 through to 12 also shouldnt have been  lent to Mr C. 
Sunny disagreed. The complaint came  to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision.  
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Mr C could repay  
the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks could take into account  a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN50484532There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Sunny agreed  that loan 13 was unfair  and it made an offer to put this right. 
I agree  with our adjudicator that this doesnt  go far enough to put things right for Mr C. But, 
as things stand,  Im not currently planning to uphold Mr Cs complaint about  loan 5 as the 
adjudicator did. Ill explain why I say this.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. 
Given the repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Cs circumstances at the time, 
and his borrowing  history  with the lender, I think it was reasonable for Sunny to rely on what 
Mr C said about his financial circumstances   Sunny had no reason at that stage to check  
that what he was saying was giving Sunny the whole picture. I dont think  it wouldve been 
proportionate for Sunny  to ask him for the amount  of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
But Mr C took out loan 5 less than two weeks after paying off loan 1  and when he was still 
paying for loans  2, 3 and 4. Ive taken into account  that loans 2, 3 and 4 were each for less 
than the amount borrowed  when Mr C took out loan 1 for £250  although I can see that 
loans 2, 3, and 4 together came to £250.  
I accept that the monthly repayments  for loan 5 (around £15) still looked affordable when  
compared to what Mr C had told Sunny about  how much he had left to spend  (more than 
£1000) based on his monthly income and other  expenses. But my feeling  is that by the time 
he was asking for loan 5, and certainly by loan 6, Sunny shouldve been prompted to think  
more carefully about whether Mr Cs habit of taking  out overlapping loans suggested that he 
needed to take out new loans because he couldnt really  afford  to pay existing borrowing in a 
way that was sustainable  in other words, without taking out more loans. And I think Sunny 
ought to have carried out further checks to ensure it had a proper understanding  of Mr Cs 
finances by the time he was asking for loan 5. 
But, looking  at the information I think Sunny wouldve seen  then, I dont think theres  
anything to indicate that Mr C was having serious problems paying his debt. If Sunny had 
looked further into his financial position, it wouldve  been able to see that he had previously 
taken out other short term loans. But, at that stage,  these had been paid. So I dont think  that 
Sunny did anything wrong when it provided loan 5 to Mr C.
Ref: DRN50484533But when he asked  for loan 6, just 3 days after hed paid loan 5, I think Sunny shouldve 
realised he was facing  problems managing his money. It would have seen that it looked like 
Mr C was probably using  some of the money  hed previously borrowed from Sunny to repay 
other short term loans  that were  due. So I dont think Sunny shouldve  given  Mr C loan 6.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C to see if there was 
a point at which Sunny reasonably shouldve seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. Thats  when Sunny shouldve realised that it shouldnt  have  provided  any 
further loans.  
I think this point was reached by loan 7 in May 2018. He took out this loan just five days  after 
paying loans 2, 3, 4 and 6. And this was the third time that hed borrowed again within a 
short time of paying off previous loans   loan 5 was taken  out 11 days  after paying loan 1, 
and loan 6 had been taken just 3 days after paying  loan 5.
And loan 7 was just the first of three  loans  he took out in May 2018. And he continued to 
take out overlapping loans. 
I think Sunny  shouldve realised that there  wasnt any indication  that Mr Cs finances had 
moved on from whatever  situation had required his previous loans. It was unlikely he was 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in income  rather, it looked like he had an ongoing 
need for the money and he wasnt making  any inroads into the amount he owed the lender. 
And by then Mr C had paid a considerable amount  of interest to Sunny to effectively service 
that debt over an extended period.
In these circumstances, I think there  was a significant risk that Mr C wouldve been unable to 
sustainably meet his monthly repayments  for loan 7  and any subsequent loans.
So I dont  think he should have been given loan 7  or any further loans after this, up to and 
including loan 13.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing which  had the effect 
of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit intended 
for short-term use over an extended  period  of time.  And the sheer  number of loans was likely 
to have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
In coming to my decision Ive thought  carefully about  everything Sunny  has said,  including  
the comments it made in response to our adjudicators assessment. But I dont agree that 
routinely repaying  loans  early, as Mr C did, is a positive sign.  To my mind borrowing and 
repaying this number of loans  early  suggests  to me that Mr Cs finances  were not in a stable 
position. 
Successfully repaying his loans doesnt mean he managed to do so in a sustainable  way. 
And when  Sunny agreed these loans  it didnt know when he might  repay them  - and they 
were due to run for 6 months.
So Im planning  on upholding  the complaint about  loans  6 through to 13 and telling Sunny it 
should take steps to put things right.
Ref: DRN50484534what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
Mr C has confirmed that hes happy  with what Ive said in my provisional decision.
Sunny hasnt said anything in response  to my provisional decision and the deadline  set for 
sending comments has now passed. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.  
As Ive heard  nothing further from Sunny in response to my provisional decision, and nothing 
else has happened to make me change my mind about this complaint, I still think  its fair to 
uphold this complaint for the reasons I explained  in my provisional decision.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr C paid on loans 6 to 13
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mr Cs credit file
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 13 should be removed from Mr Cs credit  file
Sunny  can deduct from the above amount any payment  it has already made to Mr C 
in respect of its offer to settle his complaint about loan 13.
*HMRC requires  Sunny to take off tax from this interest. If Mr C asks Sunny for a certificate 
showing how much  tax it has taken  off, Sunny should provide this. 
Ref: DRN50484535my final decision
I partially uphold  this complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) to pay Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 December  2019.
