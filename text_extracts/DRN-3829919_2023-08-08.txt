The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for a holiday club membership. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a 
claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2023 in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mr and Mrs B had bought holiday products from the holiday company, including 
purchases in April 2011, May 2012, and October 2017. They then entered into a 
membership application agreement with the holiday company in September 2018 to 
buy 23,288 holiday club membership credits. The purchase price of the credits was 
£16,500, they made a payment of £4,900 and they entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Vacation Finance for the balance of £11,550. They also exchanged 
two existing holiday products. They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of 
£150.09 to Vacation Finance.
Mr and Mrs Bs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in January 2019 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the 
membership was mis-sold to Mr and Mrs B and, but for the misrepresentations made 
to them, they wouldnt have purchased it nor entered into the loan agreement. It said 
that the holiday company was now in liquidation so cant provide the service sold and 
is in breach of contract. It also said that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair and the payment of commission was hidden from view.
Vacation Finance didnt respond to those claims so a complaint was made to this 
service. The complaint form says that: Vacation Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs B; the holiday company failed 
to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured 
them into entering into the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them; and the product was misrepresented to them; all rendering the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A and it said that the claim should also be 
considered under section 75. Mr and Mrs B have made other complaints to this 
service relating to their April 2011, May 2012, and October 2017 purchases and 
those complaints are being dealt with separately.
Our investigator recommended that Mr and Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. She 
thought that the holiday company had misrepresented the credits as something that 
would help them recoup their investment by being re-sold easily in the future and she 
said that the evidence suggested that that couldnt have been the case. She 
recommended that Vacation Finance should: cancel the loan and refund all loan 
payments with interest; amend any adverse markers on Mr and Mrs Bs credit file; 
pay them the £4,950, with interest; reimburse maintenance fees; and either procure 
Mr and Mrs Bs release from their obligations to the holiday company or agree to take 
over their points and/or indemnify them for any future maintenance costs.
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to those recommendations so this complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision. Mr and Mrs Bs representative has raised its 
serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr and Mrs B.
I said in my provisional decision: I dont consider that Mr and Mrs Bs complaint should be 
upheld for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Bs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to Mr and Mrs Bs claims or our investigators 
recommendations - so I cant say that its response to their claims has been fair or 
reasonable;
Ive been provided with a copy of the membership application agreement that Mr and 
Mrs B signed in September 2018 (but not the terms and conditions that are referred 
to in it) and the loan agreement that they also signed in September 2018 but Ive not 
been provided with the other documents that its likely that they would have also 
signed at that time;
Mr and Mrs B have provided a statement in which they say that, throughout their 
contact with the holiday company, it was emphasised that improving the type of 
accommodation, view and time of year would increase the marketing potential for 
rental and the future resale value and that they were led to believe that transferring to 
the credits was the best way to ensure a return on their investment;
they also say that they decided to seek a return on their investment and put their best 
property up for resale in January 2019 but theyve had no advice or support from the 
holiday company;
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that it was represented to Mr and Mrs B that the 
credits were worth money, they could sell their credits and that the reason to change 
to the credits was because it was the way forward for everyone and the old system 
would not be working;
neither Mr and Mrs B nor their representative has provided any documentary or other 
evidence in support of Mr and Mrs Bs claim that the credits were sold to them as an 
investment and they acknowledge that they were told that they would have more 
options as they werent tied to one level of accommodation so could spend more 
credits on a luxury apartment or less on a more modest one and that there were 
many more experiences  and they quoted from the holiday companys handbook, as 
follows: [the credits] offer you access to an amazing selection of luxury hotels and 
resorts, supercars, motor yachts and more - all without the hassle and expense of 
ownership;
they say that they decided to seek a return on their investment, retaining their best 
property to put up for resale in January 2019  but the credits didnt give them an 
interest in any property that could be sold and Im not persuaded that its likely that 
the holiday company would have guaranteed that theyd be able to sell their credits 
and I dont consider that theyve provided enough evidence to show the steps that theyve taken since January 2019 to try to resell their credits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
sold the credits to Mr and Mrs B as an investment or that it guaranteed that theyd be 
able to sell them;
I consider that the credits are worth money because Mr and Mrs B have paid money 
for them and they can be used for the accommodation and experiences referred to in 
the handbook and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
holiday company misrepresented the reasons to change to credits to Mr and Mrs B;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were 
misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr and Mrs B by the holiday company or that they 
were induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020 and I 
consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract for 
which Vacation Finance would be liable under section 75;
but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the membership that Mr and Mrs B had 
bought from the holiday company in September 2018 and that the credits are 
available for them to use;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Bs use of the credits has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs B would be entitled to 
terminate their agreement in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs B and Vacation Finance because it paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs B; the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; unduly pressured 
them into entering the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them; and the product was misrepresented to them;
Ive already explained why Im not persuaded that that the credits were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs B and Ive not been provided with any evidence to 
show what commission, if any, was paid by Vacation Finance to the holiday company 
- but, from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever 
paid it tended to be low and less than 15% and Im satisfied that Vacation Finance 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Vacation 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and Mrs 
B risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs B were 
unduly pressured into buying the credits in September 2018 or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive sales 
practices against them;
Mr and Mrs Bs complaints relating to their April 2011, May 2012, and October 2017 
purchases include claims that the holiday company unduly pressured them into 
entering into those agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them - so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales tactics that might be used by the holiday company before they went into the sales 
presentation in September 2018 and that, if they didnt want to buy the credits, they 
would have made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Bs ability to afford the loan and, as Vacation 
Finance hasnt responded to their claims, it hasnt provided any evidence about its 
assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr and Mrs B;
Mr and Mrs B say that this has caused them financial anxiety as theyre now retired 
but their loan account statement shows that between October 2018 (when their first 
payment was made) and February 2021 (the date of the statement) they made 25 
repayments of £150.91 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the loan wasnt affordable for them in September 2018 when it was made to 
them or that Vacation Finance shouldnt have made the loan to them;
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair - but Ive not been provided with copies of all of the documents that Mr 
and Mrs B would have signed in September 2018 and it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs B and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs B and 
Vacation Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Bs 
relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs B 
and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
although Vacation Finance didnt respond to Mr and Mrs Bs claims, I consider that it 
would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld their claims if it had 
properly considered them; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs B for the issues that theyve had with their credits and 
the other difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Vacation Finance to refund to 
them any of the money that theyve paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the 
loan, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.
Mr and Mrs B have referred to the financial anxiety that theyve been caused and, if 
theyre struggling to make their monthly loan repayments, I suggest that they contact 
Vacation Finance and explain to it their financial situation. Its required to respond to any 
financial difficulties that theyre experiencing positively and sympathetically.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr and Mrs B, their 
representative and Vacation Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to 
uphold this complaint. Vacation Finance hasnt provided any further comments or evidence 
but Mr and Mrs Bs representative has made detailed further submissions in response to my 
provisional decision. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:the credits were sold to Mr and Mrs B as an investment that was extremely desirable 
and could easily be resold at a profit  which was consistent with representations 
made by the holiday company in previous purchases which had initially been 
represented as an investment but at sales meetings following those purchases they 
were advised that the product currently owned was not as desirable as had been 
represented and as a consequence would prove difficult to sell so they were induced 
to trade in their existing product;
the representations made by the holiday company in relation to the previous 
purchases which led Mr and Mrs B to form the opinion that they were purchasing an 
investment applied equally to representations made by the holiday company 
immediately prior to the purchase of the credits in September 2018;
Mr and Mrs B traded in their existing products (sold to them as investments) having 
been induced to do so on the basis that it would make it easier to sell what had 
previously been represented as an investment;
it agrees with our investigators reasoning in relation to the mis-selling of the credits 
as investments and the difficulty purchasers then faced if they elected to try and sell 
their credits;
the holiday company engaged in misleading commercial practices which caused Mr 
and Mrs B to take a transactional decision that they wouldnt have otherwise done;
the closure of the holiday companys re-sale scheme as a consequence of the 
liquidation of the holiday company is a clear example of breach of contract; and
my provisional decision fails to take into consideration numerous other complaints 
made to this service in relation to this product and the accompanying supporting 
testimony of the complainants.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not persuaded that I should change the findings that I set out in my 
provisional decision. I set out in my provisional decision the reasons that Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company sold the credits to Mr and 
Mrs B as an investment or that it guaranteed that theyd be able to sell them. I dont consider 
that their representatives response to my provisional decision has provided enough further 
evidence to show that the credits were misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr and Mrs B by the 
holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the membership application 
agreement by any such misrepresentations.
The membership application agreement shows that the purchase price of the credits that Mr 
and Mrs B bought in September 2018 was £16,500 and that they exchanged 1,616 platinum 
points and 1,506 silver points. Vacation Finance would have no liability under sections 75 
and 140A arising from the sale of the platinum and silver points to Mr and Mrs B because 
they werent paid for using credit provided by Vacation Finance. Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company misrepresented the reasons to 
change to credits to Mr and Mrs B.
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that the holiday companys resale scheme has been 
closed as a consequence of the liquidation of the holiday company but theres no reference 
in the documents that Mr and Mrs B signed in September 2018 and which theyve provided 
in support of their complaint to the holiday company agreeing to offer a re-sale scheme. I 
dont consider that Mr and Mrs B have provided enough evidence to show the steps that theyve taken since January 2019 to try to resell their credits. Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the resale scheme was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs B or 
that theres been a breach of contract relating to the resale scheme.
I said in my provisional decision that I wasnt persuaded that there was enough evidence to 
show that Mr and Mrs B were unduly pressured into buying the credits in September 2018 or 
entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive 
sales practices against them. Im also not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company engaged in misleading commercial practices or that it has 
breached the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 
2010 or the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Bs relationship 
with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs B and Vacation Finance 
in these circumstances. Although Vacation Finance didnt respond to Mr and Mrs Bs claims, 
I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld their claims if 
it had properly considered them.
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs B for the issues that theyve had with their credits and the 
other difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money 
that theyve paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 September 2023.
