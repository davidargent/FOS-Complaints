K821x#15complaint
Mrs W says CashEuroNet UK LLC irresponsibly  lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 17 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided Mrs W between 
September 2009 and May 2012. Mrs Ws lending  history is in a table at the end of this 
decision. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mrs Ws complaint. He thought the lending  from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out reasonable checks  to make sure Mrs W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mrs W could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that 
this is the case.  So a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ref: DRN36976762Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ws complaint.
Our adjudicator explained that he thought QuickQuid wasnt  wrong to approve loans 1 to 4. 
Mrs W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 4. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about them. But they were part of the overall borrowing relationship Mrs W had with 
QuickQuid. So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans 
she took.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mrs W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
Mrs W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid 
over an extended period
from loan 5 onwards  Mrs W was provided with a new loan within weeks  of settling a 
previous one, and sometimes  the break  was only a few days. Mrs W went  on to 
borrow in this way for over a year and a half. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mrs W was having  to borrow  further to cover  the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances, and that Mrs Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mrs W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed QuickQuid. Loan 17 
was taken out over two and a half years after loan 1. And it was for a larger amount
the amounts  Mrs W was borrowing had generally increased. The first few loans  were  
around £50 to £100. But this rose to between  £200 and £300 up to loan 10. She 
borrowed over £500 for loan 10 and the repayment was £650.  This is a very high 
amount bearing  in mind her recorded  income  was £820  and its not clear to me how 
QuickQuid concluded she could afford  this repayment
I think that Mrs W lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs Ws ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
Ive taken on board what QuickQuid said in response to the adjudicators opinion. Much  of 
this response was that it doesnt think that a pattern of lending itself can show  detriment to a 
consumer. I hope  my findings above  have clarified why I disagree  with this.
So Im upholding  Miss Ws complaint  about loans 5 to 17 and QuickQuid should put things 
right as set out below.
Ref: DRN36976763putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs W paid on loans 5 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 17 should be removed from 
Mrs Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ws complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mrs W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 June  2019.
