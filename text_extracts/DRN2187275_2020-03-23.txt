K820x#14complaint
Ms K has complained PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA,  didnt  help when a payment was 
made using  her PayPal  account she hadnt authorised.
background
In July 2017 Ms K received a delivery. This wasnt something shed ordered. When checking 
her online banking she could see her card had been  used  for a purchase on her PayPal 
account. Her card had been charged £806.28. She complained to PayPal.  They told her to 
arrange the return of the item shed  received,  and then theyd  refund  her in full.
Ms K got in touch with the seller. Theyd made  sure the item had been sent to Ms Ks 
genuine address,  rather  than the one the fraudster had probably  requested.  They werent  
interested in getting the item back.  Ms K felt she had a bit of a conundrum but PayPal 
wouldnt budge in helping  her.
Through her bank, she made a claim under the international card schemes chargeback  
process. This wasnt successful but after bringing a complaint to this service, we asked her 
bank to refund her and pay compensation. This was sorted at the beginning of 2019.
Ms K remained concerned about an item she still held and PayPals lack of assistance. She 
felt theyd doubted her integrity. She brought her complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our investigator reviewed  what had happened. PayPal no longer had copies  of calls 
between Ms K and themselves for us to corroborate  the advice shed been given. But she 
noted Ms K had been given £50 by PayPal. It was likely this was compensation but PayPal 
could not confirm why theyd paid her this money.  Overall she felt this was fair. She didnt 
think it would  have  been right for PayPal to refund Ms K whilst  she kept the item shed been 
sent in error.
Mr K was unhappy with this outcome.  This had all been going  on for more  than two years 
and she felt shed  got nowhere.  Shes  asked  an ombudsman to review  her complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Firstly PayPals User Agreement is clear about refunds. These are provided when goods are 
returned. Ms K never returned the goods she received in error. I absolutely  understand why 
not. Theres correspondence between her and the genuine seller where they confirm they 
dont want the goods back. After that she spoke to PayPal again and was told shed initially  
been given the wrong  advice.
I know that PayPal  dont have those calls but I see no reason to doubt what Ms K tells us 
took place. Ive got no real reason to do that.  I know  Ms K believes its mildly suspicious or 
poor practice  PayPal  didnt hang  onto their calls. Id like to reassure her that doesnt matter  
as I believe what shes told us anyway.
Ref: DRN21872752But I have to balance  that with what PayPals  User  Agreement confirms.  And of course,  I can 
see they gave  Ms K £50. Although theyre  not able to say why, I think  its most likely  based 
on the timing  this was in compensation for giving her the wrong advice.
Ms K has received the money back she lost from her card (as well as compensation). So she 
is no longer out of pocket. I know she remains upset and annoyed by her treatment by 
PayPal. But its not my role to punish PayPal for getting something wrong. Its about looking 
at the impact  overall and whats happened. I think most of the impact is about Ms K being  a 
victim of fraud. That seems  to me to mostly  fall on her bank. Shes been compensated for 
this. I dont really believe  it would be fair to ask PayPal to do more.
I know Ms K will be unhappy with this outcome but my final decision  brings  our services 
involvement to an end.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Ms Ks complaint against 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.
