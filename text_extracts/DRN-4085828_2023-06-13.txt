The complaint
Ms O complains about NewDay Ltd recording adverse information on her credit file in 
relation to a credit card account.
What happened
Ms O stopped making payments towards her credit card from December 2020. Despite 
NewDay allowing several payment holidays, it recorded a default on Ms Os credit file at the 
end of March 2022. 
Unhappy with NewDays decision to register the default, Ms O made a complaint. NewDay 
felt it had correctly followed its procedures regarding the missed payments and rejected her 
complaint.
Because Ms O remained unhappy, she brought a complaint to this service. Our investigator 
looked into it and recommended that it should be upheld in part. They concluded that, 
although NewDay was entitled to register the default, its delay in doing so had caused Ms O 
a loss. The investigator asked NewDay to amend her credit file in relation to the account to 
show it as defaulting when the account was terminated in August 2021. They also asked 
NewDay to pay £100 as compensation for the inconvenience caused by its handling of the 
matter.
Neither party agreed with the investigators findings. Ms O didnt provide a detailed 
explanation as to why. NewDay felt it had recorded the default in line with its collections 
process and given Ms O adequate notice of its intention to do so, allowing her time to 
manage her finances. The complaint was passed to me review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding this complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Its not in dispute that Ms O initially missed two payments on her account. From what I can 
see, NewDay received no payments from Ms O after December 2020. After that time, 
NewDay agreed several payment holidays, for a month at first then extended by three 
months on two occasions. 
No further payments were made to bring the account up to date and, after sending letters (to 
her last known address) chasing the debt, NewDay sent Ms O a default notice in July 2021. 
This said, among other things:
We will share details of the status of your account with credit reference agencies 
which may make it harder for you to get credit in future.
I think that was in line with the terms of the credit agreement Mrs O entered into with 
NewDay which said information might be disclosed to credit reference agencies if payments 
were missed, making it more difficult for her to borrow. 
While Ms O suggests NewDay led her to believe the account wouldnt be defaulted because 
of the health problems she faced and had declared to it, I havent seen evidence to support 
that. 
Overall, I dont find that NewDay treated Ms O unfairly in recording adverse information on 
her credit file. It follows that I wont be asking NewDay to remove the default from her 
records.
That said, I question the timing of when NewDay recorded the information on Ms Os credit 
file. This is important as information recorded late would, in effect, adversely impact her for 
longer. This type of scenarios recognised by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) 
which says a default may be registered when a consumers at least three months behind 
with their payments. The ICO would usually expect a default to be registered by the time the 
consumers six months behind with their payments. 
In the circumstances, I see no reason why NewDay shouldnt have acted in accordance with 
the advice and guidance of the ICO in Ms Os case. On that basis, and given Ms O first 
missed payments from the end of 2020, its reasonable to think the default would have been 
registered by mid-2021 at the latest. 
Im aware that NewDay had agreed to several payment holidays in that time, and that it 
considered it was following its own collections policy. But, bearing in mind the ICOs 
established position and the lack of payments forthcoming, I believe it ought to have been 
clear long before the default was eventually registered in March 2022 that Ms O wasnt able 
to make her contractual payments.
As such, I believe NewDay should amend Ms Os credit file to show the account defaulted 
sooner than March 2022. I think a reasonable date to use in this instance would be August 
2021 given the payment opportunities Ms O was provided with by then and considering 
thats when the account was terminated. That would mean the default marker coming off 
Ms Os credit file  and no longer hindering her ability to secure mainstream lending  
around seven months sooner than it would otherwise have done. 
Because of the actions of NewDay and their impact on Ms O, who I understand was already 
struggling with her health for much of the time these issues were ongoing, I think it should 
also pay her £100 as compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Putting things right
NewDay should: 
Amend Ms Os credit file to record the default on the account as occurring no later 
than August 2021; and
Pay Ms O £100 as compensation for the distress and inconvenience its caused her.
My final decision
For the reasons given, Im upholding this complaint in part. I require NewDay Ltd to put 
things right for Ms O as explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or reject my decision before 11 July 2023.
