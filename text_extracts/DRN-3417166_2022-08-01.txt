The complaint
Ms O is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved her for credit which she feels 
wasnt affordable for her at that time.
What happened
In September 2020, NewDay approved an application made by Ms O for a new line of credit 
and issued her with a credit card account with a credit limit of £600.
In June 2021, Ms O raised a complaint with NewDay because she felt she hadnt been able 
to afford the credit shed been provided by NewDay in 2020, and that this should have been 
apparent to NewDay, had they undertaken checks into her financial position before 
approving her for that credit.
NewDay looked at Ms Os complaint. They confirmed that they had undertaken checks into 
her financial position before approving her credit application, and felt thered been nothing 
resulting from those checks that should have reasonably given them cause to suspect that 
Ms O might not be able to afford that credit at that time.
Ms O wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that it should have been apparent 
to NewDay, from the information they gathered about Ms O at the point of application, that 
Ms O wouldnt in all likelihood be able to afford the credit she was applying for, such that it 
shouldnt have been provided to her. So, they recommended that this complaint be upheld in 
Ms Os favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
 
NewDay believe that they did that here, and note that at the time of the application they took 
information from Ms O directly about her employment status and annual income, as well as 
obtained information about Ms O from a credit reference agency so as to get a better 
understanding of her wider financial position. And NewDay contend there was nothing 
resulting from that information that they feel should have given them any reasonable cause 
to believe that Ms O might not be able to afford the credit she was subsequently approved 
for.
It's notable that NewDay assessed Ms O as being employed with a gross income of £19,000 
per year. NewDay also assessed Ms O as having total existing unsecured debt of £19,300, 
as well as having an existing mortgage that she was repaying. 
This means that at the point of application, NewDay understood that Ms O already had an 
existing unsecured debt amount that was more than her gross annual income at that time 
(and therefore considerably more than her net annual income). 
This is a significant level of existing debt, especially in consideration of Ms Os relatively low 
annual income (meaning that Ms O was less likely to have had disposable income available 
to her after her monthly expenditure was accounted for), as well as in consideration of Ms 
Os need to make monthly mortgage payments and pay for essential spending such as food 
and energy payments.
At the very last I feel that the circumstances described above should have given NewDay 
cause to have undertaken more detailed checks into Ms Os financial position so as to 
confirm that she would be able to sustainably repay the new line of credit that she was 
applying for. 
And had NewDay undertaken such further checks, I feel that it would have been the case 
that the unaffordability of the credit for Ms O would have become apparent at that time. And 
this is because Im satisfied that NewDay would have seen that Ms O was already spending 
a very significant portion of her net monthly income on her existing financial commitments 
such that the provision of any further credit to her at that time wouldnt in all likelihood have 
been sustainably affordable for her. 
It's also notable that Ms Os level of unsecured debt had been increasingly steadily over the 
preceding years, with Ms O taking out new credit accounts to increase her overall credit 
amount in 2018 (once) and 2019 (twice).
So, while it may have been the case that Ms O hadnt fallen into arrears on any of her exiting 
credit commitments at that time, Im satisfied that it was the case that her existing level of 
unsecured debt was already at a level that was in all likelihood unsustainable for her when 
she made the application to NewDay for a new line of credit in 2020. And I feel that this 
should have been apparent to NewDay from the information that they assessed about Ms O 
before approving that application.
All of which means that Ill be upholding this complaint in Ms Os favour and instructing 
NewDay to take corrective action as follows.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Ms Os account all fees, charges, and interest incurred or 
accrued on the account from the point of opening.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Ms Os favour, NewDay must pay this 
balance to Ms O along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of payment.
If, following the reimbursements instructed above, a balance remains on the account to be 
paid by Ms O, NewDay must contact Ms O and arrange an affordable payment plan with her, 
ensuring that no interest or fees are charged on the balance to be repaid. If NewDay havent 
already done so, NewDay may restrict the use of the account to prevent events happening for which charges would usually be incurred.
Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse reporting relating to this account from Ms Os 
credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, on the 
basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 August 2022.
