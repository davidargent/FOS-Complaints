DRN-4032104
The complaint
Mr A has complained that PayrNet Limited (under the brand Pockit) hasnt returned his funds 
to him after closing his account.
What happened
In late 2021, PayrNet explained they were closing Mr As account following a review. They 
asked Mr A which account they should return his balance to, and he provided his bank 
details. But after some delay, in early 2022 PayrNet paid the funds to a different account of 
Mr As which had since closed, so the payment bounced back.
PayrNet didnt notice the payment had bounced back. So when Mr A chased them, they 
either claimed theyd already paid him, or ignored his correspondence. They paid Mr A £150 
compensation for the initial delay, but insisted theyd refunded him in early 2022.
Our investigator looked into things independently and upheld the complaint. They said 
PayrNet should return Mr As funds and pay a further £300 compensation for the significant 
delay they caused. PayrNet paid the £300 compensation, but didnt return Mr As funds, 
saying they were having trouble doing so.
Our investigator awarded a further £250 compensation for the further delay, and reiterated 
that PayrNet should return Mr As funds immediately. PayrNet didnt substantially respond, 
so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I find that PayrNet got things very wrong here. Theyve communicated disappointingly poorly 
 at times seemingly ignoring Mr A outright. And theyve so far failed to pay Mr A his money 
for about a year and a half, despite all the chasing that Mr A and our service have done. It 
looks like the account they tried to pay in early 2022 was a different one to the one Mr A 
asked them to pay. And they should certainly have noticed that the funds had bounced back, 
instead of continually insisting theyd returned Mr As money when they hadnt.
I do not see a good reason why PayrNet should still be having trouble paying Mr A. Mr A 
provided two different accounts they could pay his funds to, and he provided statements for 
both to confirm his details. And PayrNet successfully paid Mr A his compensation, so they 
clearly are capable of paying him. Mr As also said hes happy to accept payment by cheque. 
In any case, if PayrNet are having issues making the payment, thats something for them to 
sort out as quickly as possible  its not an issue for them to pass onto Mr A.
I agree with our investigator that PayrNet should pay Mr A further compensation to account 
for their further delay and the further trouble, stress, and frustration theyve caused. Our 
investigator suggested £250, but I think it would be more reasonable for PayrNet to add 8% 
simple interest onto the refund of Mr As balance. This is the same rate that courts use to 
compensate people for the time theyre without their money. This interest should be paid 
from November 2021  when PayrNet were first supposed to return Mr As balance  until 
the date his balance is returned now. And the longer that PayrNet take to return Mr As 
funds, the more that this simple interest amount will increase. Mr A explained that his 
remaining balance was about £2,600, which means that at present the 8% simple interest 
will be about £300 or so.
Putting things right
I direct PayrNet Limited to:
pay Mr A his remaining funds; and-
pay simple interest to Mr A on those funds, at the rate of 8% simple a year, payable 
from November 2021 until the date the money is returned to him. This is to 
compensate Mr A for the time he didnt have his money.
 HM Revenue & Customs may require PayrNet to take off tax from this simple interest. PayrNet must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. Mr A may be able to 
claim the tax back from HMRC if he doesnt normally pay tax.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr As complaint, and direct PayrNet Limited to put 
things right by doing what Ive said above
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2023.
