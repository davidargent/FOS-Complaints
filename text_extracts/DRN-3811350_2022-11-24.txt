The complaint
Miss A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed her loan and
recorded a default on her credit file.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Miss A had a loan and credit card with NatWest. In September 2021 NatWest received
notice that Miss A had entered into an IVA, including the credit card and loan. But Miss A
had second thoughts and cancelled the IVA around two weeks later. Miss A says she
emailed a copy of the IVA cancellation confirmation to NatWest on 4 October 2021.
Miss A contacted the loan team and advised that she wanted to agree a payment plan. But
the loan team advised that her account had been referred to the recoveries department and
would be handled by a third party agent. NatWest explained the third party would be in touch
to discuss payments.
Despite several calls to NatWest over the following weeks Miss A didnt hear from the third
party and NatWest declined to agree any payment plans. In December 2021 NatWest issued
a formal demand and in January 2022 it terminated the loan, recording a default on Miss As
credit file.
Miss A complained and pointed out that NatWests credit card team had been able to agree
a payment plan and take steps to ensure no default was recorded on her credit file. But the
loan team had not offered the same support. NatWest issued a final response but didnt
agree it had acted unfairly.
An investigator at this service looked at Miss As complaint. They didnt think NatWest had
treated Miss A unfairly. Miss A asked to appeal and said shed been prevented from
agreeing a payment arrangement with NatWest despite making numerous requests to do so.
As Miss A asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss A entered an IVA but quickly decided it wasnt right for her. I can see Miss A contacted
NatWests loan teams on 22 October 2021 and was given the email address to forward the
relevant documents. NatWest says it received the evidence on 3 November 2021 and
advised Miss A its third party agent would be in touch to discuss the loan and potential
arrangements.
Looking at the call notes and what Miss As told us, its clear she wanted to agree a payment
arrangement of some kind. I understand it was NatWests decision to refer the matter to
specialists and a third party. But it appears to me that there were delays in that process. On
4 November 2021 a default notice was issued, despite Miss A advising she wanted to begin
payments.
I can see Miss A contacted NatWest throughout November and December 2021 to try and
agree an arrangement. On 8 December 2021 NatWest sent Miss A a formal demand.
NatWests contact notes from 21 December 2021 say the DCA (debt collection agency)
instruction was pending at that point and no plan could be agreed. But Miss As told us no
contact was received before the loan was terminated and a default recorded.
I agree with Miss A that NatWest failed to treat her fairly after she advised the IVA had been
cancelled. Whilst I understand the recoveries team wanted the third party to act on
NatWests behalf, I cant see any reason for the delay in making contact with Miss A. In my
view, NatWest ought to have ensured contact was made without any delay so Miss A
could discuss options for reaching an arrangement. Instead, NatWest issued default letters
and declined to engage when Miss A asked to make payments.
Based on the information Ive seen so far, I intend to uphold Miss As complaint. I think the
fairest approach would be for NatWest to rewind the loan to October 2021 and either discuss
plans for a payment arrangement with her directly or make plans for its third party agents to
do so. Miss A should be aware that this process will likely include an income and
expenditure assessment. And if that doesnt show Miss A is able to afford a payment
arrangement, NatWest wont be obliged to reinstate the account or amend her credit file.
If Miss A is shown to be in a position to sustainably make payments under an arrangement,
NatWest will then have to take steps to reactivate her loan and remove the default.
In my view, the level of service provided to Miss A shouldve been better. Miss A has told us
she feels confused by the differing approaches taken by the loan and credit card teams and
NatWest. And I think she has a point. One team was able to deal with Miss A in a way that
meant she didnt receive a default, the other was not. I see no reason why Miss A shouldnt
expect consistent treatment from NatWest or that it wouldve been unfair to agree a payment
arrangement in place of terminating the loan. So I also intend to tell NatWest to pay Miss A
£250 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or points they wanted me to 
consider before making my final decision. Miss A confirmed she was willing to accept. 
NatWest didnt accept my provisional decision. NatWest responded and reiterated it had 
followed the correct approach and that no mistakes had been made. NatWest also gave 
information about the normal process it follows when reopening a loan and how that will 
impact Miss As credit file. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest responded to say it remained of the view it had followed the correct process and 
that its decision to default the account loan was reasonable. But my view remains the same 
as I reached in my provisional decision. Ultimately, Miss A notified NatWest the IVA had 
been cancelled on 22 October 2021. Miss A then forwarded the requested evidence to 
NatWest on 3 November 2021. NatWest says it needed to instruct a third party to handle 
Miss As account. But NatWests delay in taking that step very much impacted what 
happened to Miss As loan. Ive looked back over the file and can see Miss A made concerted efforts to try and 
proactively work with NatWest. The evidence provided shows Miss A was told to wait for a 
third party but in the meantime her loan was closed and a default recorded. NatWest says 
its followed the standard approach when someone decides to cancel an IVA and no 
mistakes were made. But Im satisfied there were lengthy delays that impacted Miss A 
unfairly and that NatWest couldve acted sooner. I havent been persuaded to change my 
view of how to resolve Miss As complaint. 
NatWests response also says that it can reopen the loan and then check whether Miss A 
can afford to make repayments and reach an agreement in relation to the arrears. NatWest 
says that if Miss A cant, it will move the loan back through the default process again and 
that would lead to a later default date overall. Whilst I understand thats the normal 
approach, Im not persuaded thats fair in Miss As case. 
Given the time its taken to reach this stage, history of Miss As case and way her loan was 
handled, Id expect NatWest to complete the necessary income and expenditure 
assessments before it reopens the loan, not after. If Miss As income and expenditure 
assessment doesnt show affordability, NatWest can leave the existing default in place  in 
line with the settlement I noted in my provisional decision. But if the assessment shows 
Miss A is able to afford to begin payments again and agree an arrangement for the arrears, 
NatWest should reinstate the loan on its systems. At that stage, Miss As credit file can be 
updated to include the arrangement.
As I havent been persuaded to change my view, Im upholding Miss As complaint in line 
with the settlement noted in my provisional decision. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to 
settle as follows: 
- Within four weeks of acceptance, contact Miss A and complete an income and
expenditure assessment (or other appropriate assessment) with a view to agreeing a
payment arrangement for the loan
- If the process shows Miss A can sustainably maintain a payment arrangement,
NatWest should reinstate the loan and remove the default from her credit file
- Pay Miss A £250 for the distress and inconvenience causedUnder the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2022.
