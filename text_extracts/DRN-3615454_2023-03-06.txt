The complaint
Mr D complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
Mr D and his wife were members of a holiday club and they entered into a purchase 
agreement in October 2014 to buy some more holiday club membership points. The price of 
those points was £4,950 and Mr D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of 
£71.57 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan was repaid in July 2015. 
Mr Ds representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in March 2017 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that Mr D and his wife went 
to a meeting with the holiday company with the intention of seeking advice about releasing 
their existing membership due to the deteriorating health of Mr Ds wife but were told that the 
best option for them was to buy more points. Mr Ds representative says that the 
membership was misrepresented to Mr D and his wife, the holiday company breached the 
contract, there was an unfair relationship between Mr D and Barclays Partner Finance, unfair 
pressure was applied to them to get them to sign the agreements, a proper assessment of 
the affordability of the loan for Mr D hadnt been made and a commission was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company that wasnt disclosed to Mr D. 
Barclays Partner Finance responded to those claims in detail. It set out the reasons that it 
said that they shouldnt be upheld, including that a credit application was completed for Mr D 
and it assessed that the monthly payment of £71.57 was affordable for him, Mr D and his 
wife had made 20 reservations since they took out their membership in 2001 and Mr D had 
contacted the holiday company in 2012 about relinquishing the membership and his options 
were explained to him. Mr D wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ds complaint should be upheld. She said that 
there was no evidence that Mr D notified Barclays Partner Finance that he and his wife 
werent able to travel and that he had previously contacted the holiday company about 
relinquishing his membership and the options were explained to him. She wasnt persuaded 
that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the holiday 
company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that 
the relationship between Mr D and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She said 
that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for 
Mr D and she didnt consider that Barclays Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in 
connection with any commission paid to the holiday company or that it had breached EU 
law.
Mr Ds representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that the investigators recommendations arent accepted and it has 
provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ds claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays 
Partner Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr Ds representative says that Mr D and his wife went to a meeting with the holiday 
company with the intention of seeking advice about releasing their existing 
membership due to the deteriorating health of Mr Ds wife but were told that the best 
option for them was to buy more points;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr D contacted the holiday company in May 2012 
to enquire about his options for relinquishing his membership and was verbally 
advised of the options available to him and that one of the criteria under which 
relinquishment of membership can be accepted is if a member is unable to travel or 
secure travel insurance or is experiencing reduced income as a result of their health;
it says that if the holiday company had been contacted about the deteriorating health 
of Mr Ds wife, it would have expected that their membership would have been 
relinquished but theres nothing on Mr Ds and his wifes records to suggest that such 
a request was ever made;
it also says that since Mr D and his wife first acquired membership points with the 
holiday company they have made 20 reservations and travelled on 18 of them - with 
the remaining two being cancelled in 2016 and that they didnt pay their 2016 
maintenance fees;
Mr D and his wife signed the purchase agreement, the terms and conditions, a 
separate standard form of the withdrawal notice, a key information document, 
information about an exchange programme, and a compliance statement and 
declaration to treating customers fairly;
Ive carefully considered those documents and what Mr Ds representative has said 
about the misrepresentations and breach of contract  but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the membership points that Mr D and his wife 
bought in 2014 were misrepresented to them or that they were induced into entering 
into the purchase agreement by a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the purchase agreement or of any applicable law for which Barclays Partner 
Finance would be liable in these circumstances;Mr Ds representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ds financial position and ability to repay the loan  but Barclays 
Partner Finance has provided a copy of the credit application that was signed by 
Mr D in which he declared that his annual income was £30,000 and that he was a 
homeowner;
I consider that it was reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to conclude on the 
basis of the information that Mr D had provided that he could afford a loan with 
monthly repayments of £71.57;
the loan was repaid in July 2015, eight months after it was made to Mr D, when he 
made a payment of £4,868.37 by debit card and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr D in October 2014;
Mr Ds representative says that the holiday company applied considerable pressure 
to Mr D to procure his agreement to the loan - but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Mr D and his wife were unduly pressurised into 
entering into the purchase agreement or that Mr D was unduly pressurised into 
entering into the loan agreement in October 2014 or that the holiday company used 
unacceptable sales practices against them  if they were concerned about the way 
that those agreements were sold to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them not to have withdrawn from those agreements within the withdrawal 
periods but Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance about a withdrawal during the withdrawal 
periods;
Mr Ds representative says that Barclays Partner Finance should have told him about 
any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr D 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ds representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr Ds relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ds relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr D and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr Ds claims was fair and 
reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr D and his wife for the issues that theyve have had with their 
membership and her health issues, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr D any of the money that he 
paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
