Mr F complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to him. 
background 
Between October 2016 and June  2017,  Mr F borrowed 9 loans from Sunny. The borrowing 
history is as follows:

1 15/10/2016 31/03/2017 6 300 £90.56
2 06/12/2016 28/04/2017 6 150 £47.92
3 02/01/2017 31/03/2017 6 100 £32.67

7 13/04/2017 21/07/2017 6 100 £30.41
8 29/04/2017 22/11/2017 6 300 £100.00

Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partly upheld.  She said that by loan 4, 
Sunny should  have  probably known that Mr F was having financial problems. By loan 6, she 
thought Sunny should have realised  Mr F was persistently reliant  on short-term loans. 
Sunny disagreed with that view.  However, it accepted that it should not have agreed to lend 
loans 8 and 9 to Mr F. It offered to settle  the complaint on that basis. Mr F did not accept 
Sunnys offer,  which  was not in line with our adjudicators  recommendation. 
Another of our adjudicators then looked  at the matter. He thought  that Sunny had probably 
done enough when it agreed to lend loans 4 and 5. But he agreed with the first adjudicator 
that it should not have agreed to lend loans 6 to 9. 
Neither party responded to our adjudicators second view. So the matter  has been  passed to 
me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
Ref: DRN45940122different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
Neither party has disagreed with what our first adjudicator said about loans 1 to 3. So I 
havent considered further whether Sunny  was irresponsible to agree to lend Mr F that 
money. 
As I said above, our first adjudicator thought  that the complaint should be upheld in respect 
of loans 4 and 5 because  Sunny should  have asked more questions.  I agree with the first 
adjudicator to the extent that Sunny probably  should have done more to find out about the 
Mr Fs financial circumstances when he applied  for loans 4 and 5. But the evidence  Ive seen 
doesnt suggest that Sunny would  have been  wrong to provide  that borrowing to Mr F even if 
it had undertaken  more  enquiries. With that in mind, I agree with our second adjudicator and 
I dont uphold the complaint in respect of loans 4 and 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
Ref: DRN45940123unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If that was the case, Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt provide any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I agree with our adjudicators that this 
stage was reached by loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr F was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr F had taken out 6 loans within around 6 months.  So Sunny should 
have known it was most  likely  that Mr F had to borrow  further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that his indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Fs first loan was for £300 and loan 6 was for £100  although Mr F also had two 
outstanding loans of £150 running alongside  this borrowing. At this point, it should 
have been clear to Sunny that Mr F was not likely borrowing  to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  9 was 
taken out 8 months after Mr Fs first. At the same  time, he had two other  Sunny loans 
outstanding (one for £100 and another for £300). In my view, Mr F had paid large  
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Mr F borrowed was likely  to have had negative implications on 
his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 9 and Sunny must  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  6 to 9; 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 9 must be removed from Mr Fs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN45940124For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Fs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2020.
