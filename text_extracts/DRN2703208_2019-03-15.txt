K820x#14complaint
Mrs J says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited (FICL) mis-sold her a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy.
background
Mrs J bought the policy in 1999 at the same time as she took out a store card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs J disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is here),  I reach my conclusions on the balance  
of probabilities  that is, what I think is most  likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Js case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Js complaint and Ive set out my reasons below.
 Mrs J says she didnt know the PPI had been added  to her account,  and that she 
wouldnt have agreed to buy it. Ive noted  everything Mrs J has said.  The difficulty  I 
have is that I cant be sure what was discussed between  Mrs J and the sales person 
when the policy  was sold. Im also mindful that these  events happened many years  
ago. I can also see that Mrs J did tick the box on the store  card application  form to say 
that she wanted the cover, and signed the same section of the form. 
Without anything  else to support what Mrs J has told me, I havent  been able to safely 
conclude that she wasnt made aware  that she had a choice about buying  the PPI. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs J so it didnt have to check  if it was suitable for 
her. That means it didnt  have  to ask about  any employer benefits Mrs J might have 
been entitled to.  
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs J about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it should 
have been. But its unlikely Mrs J would have been  affected  by any of the main  things 
the policy didnt  cover, and the policy had a reasonable benefit. So I dont think  better 
information wouldve  stopped  her buying  it.
