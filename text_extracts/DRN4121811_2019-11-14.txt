K821x#15Complaint
Mr S has complained about the loans he took out through MYJAR Limited (MYJAR). He 
says MYJAR  lent to him irresponsibly and it didnt undertake affordability checks. Mr S says 
that had MYJAR  done more it wouldve realised he was borrowing from a number of other 
payday loan providers. 
Background
Mr S took out 10 loans  from MYJAR between 6 October 2015  and 1 February 2018. Based 
on the information, it seems Mr S had some problems repaying his final loan, and an 
outstanding balance remains.
A summary  of Mr Ss borrowing, based on the information provided  to us from MYJAR,  can 
be found below.

In our most recent assessment our adjudicator thought that MYJAR had treated Mr S unfairly 
by providing loans 6  9. She thought by this time a pattern of lending had developed and so 
MYJAR was wrong to have provided these  loans.
Our adjudicator felt that given  the amount of time between  Mr S repaying  loan 9 and taking 
out loan 10, it was reasonable  for MYJAR to believe Mr Ss financial circumstances may 
have improved and to consider loan 10 as the start of a new lending relationship. Our 
adjudicator also believed that the checks MYJAR  carried out for loan 10 were proportionate 
and the loan appeared affordable for Mr S. Based on this, the adjudicator  didnt think MYJAR 
were wrong to have  given  Mr S loan 10.
Mr S appears to have  accepted the adjudicators  view.
MYJAR didnt agree  with the adjudicators findings. It asked our adjudicator to consider that 
the majority of Mr Ss loans had the repayments spread over a longer term and had been  
either repaid on time or settled early. 
No agreement could  be reached,  so the case  has been passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ref: DRN41218112Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to 
reasonably conclude Mr S could  repay  the loans in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that MYJAR  shouldnt  have provided Mr S with loans 6 to 9, 
because there were signs by loan 6 that he was having problems repaying  his previous 
loans. Ive thought carefully  about whether MYJAR made an error  in relation to these loans. 
In this instance, I also think MYJAR should  reasonably have seen that Mr S was unlikely to 
have been able to make his loan repayments  in a sustainable manner by the time it provided 
loan 6. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 to 5 of Mr S taking new loans 
shortly after repaying  previous ones. I think that by loan 6, MYJAR ought fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded that pattern as established. By the sixth loan Mr S had 
an unbroken borrowing relationship  for six months.
From  loan 6 to 9, Mr S was provided with a new loan on the same day he settled a 
previous loan and there was no sustained, significant reduction  in his borrowing. So 
MYJAR ought to have  realised  it was more likely than not Mr S was having  to borrow 
Ref: DRN41218113further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances, and 
that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed  MYJAR  and his 
indebtedness was being prolonged for an extended  period of time. Loan 9 was 
provided around 10 months  after Mr Ss first. And it was for 15 times the amount  of     
Mr Ss first loan. This meant that Mr S paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because MYJAR  provided loans 6 to 9 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time 
and
the extended period of time Mr S owed MYJAR money was likely to have had 
negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 9 and MYJAR should  put things right as set
out below.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
if MYJAR  still owns loan 10, it may use the above redress to reduce any outstanding  
balance that remains  on this loan. If there is any redress left over after this it should 
be paid directly to Mr S.
If MYJAR  doesnt  own the outstanding  balance or is unable  to buy back the debt then 
it is not entitled to use the above compensation to offset any outstanding  balance.
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 to 10 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  these  loans should be removed from
Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. 
MYJAR should pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 December  2019.
