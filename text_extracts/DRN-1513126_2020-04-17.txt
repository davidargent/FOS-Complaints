The complaint
Miss O says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss O told us her debt problems got worse as a result of the borrowing and she 
had to borrow from other short-term credit providers to keep up with her repayments. She 
struggled to make ends meet and couldnt cover essential living costs.
 What happened
This complaint is about 12 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss O between July 2018 
and March 2019. Miss Os borrowing history is as follows:

1 05/07/2018 19/12/2018 Instalment £250.00
2 16/07/2018 08/10/2018 Instalment £200.00

12 31/03/2019 13/04/2019 Instalment £100.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Os complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given. And they thought any borrowing from loan six was 
adverse so all information about loans six to 12 should be removed from Miss Os credit file. 
Another of our adjudicators reviewed the file while it was waiting for a final decision and 
thought that only the information for loans 11 and 12 was adverse. The parties were told of 
this slight change.Sunny disagreed with the assessment so as the complaint remains unresolved it has been 
passed to me for decision in my role as ombudsman.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss O could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss O could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss O didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss O had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Os complaint. And after doing so, Im upholding the 
complaint in part. Ill explain why.Like the adjudicator, Sunny should have reconsidered whether it was fair to give Miss O 
more borrowing when she applied for loan four as I think there was evidence she was having 
problems managing her money. 
Miss O had borrowed three times in July 2018, the third loan being taken just three days 
after loan two was taken  a total of £600. And when Miss O applied for loan four in 
September 2018 those three loans were still outstanding. Sunny has told us its short-term 
lending product is flexible. Its consumers can take up to four loans at any one time. But I 
think such a quick uptake for further borrowing can equally be a sign that a consumer is 
struggling to manage their money and I think Sunny should have done more to build up a 
picture of Miss Os financial circumstances. Miss O has told us that she was struggling to 
make ends meet and the borrowing pattern that was starting to emerge would suggest that 
was most likely.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Os case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 11. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss O was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss O had taken out 11 loans within eight months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss O was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Os indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss O was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
As examples, loan eight was taken three days after loan six was repaid and loan nine 
was taken four days after loan five was repaid. Such a pattern could indicate 
persistent reliance upon short-term lending. 
Miss O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out eight months after Miss Os first. Miss O had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Miss O lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Os indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans which Miss O borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Os ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 12 and Sunny should put things 
right. 
 Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss O paid on loans four to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;remove any negative information about four to ten from Miss Os credit file;
the loans taken from loan 11 onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So, all entries about loans 11 and 12 should be removed from Miss Os 
credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Os complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 May 2020.
