Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint  and thought  the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed but later made  a partial  offer to uphold the complaint from loan 27 onwards 
offering to repay  the interest and charges, but Mr S didnt agree with the offer. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN20778302the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
In response to the adjudicator, neither party has made any comments about loans one to 
three not being  upheld. And because  there  doesnt appear to be any outstanding dispute 
about these loans, I wont be making a finding  on these loans in this decision.  But I have 
thought about these  loans  in the overall  context of Mr Ss lending relationship. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
I think that by the time Mr S took loan four it would have been  reasonable for Sunny to have 
considered a proportionate check of his financial situation. Mr Ss borrowing  behaviour  would 
suggest that he was struggling to manage  his money. When  loan four was taken Mr S still 
had two outstanding loans  with Sunny,  which  correspondingly  would lead to higher monthly 
repayments. 
And if Sunny had looked into Mr Ss financial  circumstances,  it would have found out that he 
was taking short-term  loans from other providers and there was a loan outstanding  at the 
point of application for loan four. This borrowing would have increased the debt he would 
need to finance on a monthly basis. So I think Sunny should have questioned whether  it 
should have continued to lend to Mr S as the pattern of Mr Ss borrowing flagged up that he 
was having problems with his finances.  
I dont necessarily agree with Sunnys  conclusion  that by repaying a loan early  this means a 
customer is saving themselves interest implying they were managing their money. Its 
equally possible that Mr S was juggling his finances by borrowing  to pay off his short-term 
loans with Sunny or other short-term loan providers. And I think by Mr S taking 31 loans in 
16 months would  suggest  the loans were unsustainable.
Ref: DRN20778303Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out six loans within seven months. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having  to borrow further  to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that 
Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.  
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 31 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Ss first. Mr S had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 31 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans four to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans four and five from Mr Ss credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  from loan six onwards should  be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN20778304Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 March 2020.
