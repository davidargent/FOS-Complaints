K820x#14complaint
Mrs C says The Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold  Royalties  and Royalties Gold  
packaged bank  accounts to her. Shes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to 
complain. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mrs Cs complaint and didnt think  RBS had mis-sold the 
packaged accounts. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Cs complaint. Having done so, I dont  think RBS mis-sold  the packaged 
accounts to Mrs C. Id like to explain why I think thats the case.  
Free accounts  are widely available in the United Kingdom. And as Mrs C had one with RBS 
previously, I think that she wouldve known they were available if thats what  she really 
wanted. So I think that Mrs C chose to take the Royalties and Royalties Gold  accounts 
knowing she didnt need to have them. I also think she used the main benefit she upgraded 
for  the preferential  borrowing rates. I think she also couldve used some other benefits too.
Im open  to the possibility Mrs C wasnt told absolutely everything she needed to know  about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest she wouldve been  affected by the 
main limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a 
difference and I think Mrs C was given  enough  to know and understand what  she was 
agreeing to on each occasion. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Cs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs C to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 March 2019.
