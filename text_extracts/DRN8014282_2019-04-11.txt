Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M had ten loans with QuickQuid. Loan  1 was a FlexCredit account. This allowed Mr M to 
make drawdowns up to a fixed  limit and repay them  in up to ten months. Loans 2-10 were 
payday loans,  repayable  in between one and three payments. Loan 10 was refinanced (to 
loan 10a)  Mr M borrowed extra funds and extended the term of the loan.

An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She didnt 
think QuickQuid shouldve  approved loans 5-10 (including the refinance loan 10a). She 
thought that by this time, QuickQuid ought  to have  realised  the pattern of lending indicated  
that providing further loans wouldve been unsustainable or otherwise  harmful for Mr M. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.  
As theres  been  no further dispute  about loans 1-4, Ill only be considering loans 5-10 in my 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ms case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint about  loans  5-10 and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.
Ref: DRN80142822But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Our adjudicator thought that, in Mr Ms 
case, this point had been reached when Mr M asked for loan 5.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, Ive also thought about 
whether the overall pattern of lending increased  Mr Ws indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending in Mr Ms case. Ive looked  to see if there was a 
point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think 
that this point was reached by loan 5. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr M was borrowing were not generally decreasing, and QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it was likely  Mr M wasnt sustainably settling his debt with it
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. And he was 
in effect paying large amounts of interest to service his debt over an extended period
Mr M was demonstrating repayment difficulties; he had extended two of his previous 
loans and took out loan 5 on the day loan 4 was repaid
I think that Mr M lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 5 to 10a because the overall  pattern  of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Ive thought about the points QuickQuid raised  in response to my decision.  It provided  a 
generic document about changes to its lending processes post March 2015. This Service  
has responded to QuickQuid about this document directly and through  earlier final decisions. 
Ref: DRN80142823So I am not going to expand on what weve previous said here,  though I have considered  the 
document alongside everything else in making my decision. 
QuickQuid also provided some information about  its estimate of Mr Ms disposable income at 
the time of loans  5-10. It said it used credit reference agency validated  (CRA)  figures for 
Mr Ms credit commitments and that based on what it saw (and Mr Ms declared income)  
loans 5-10 were affordable for Mr M.
I understand why QuickQuid has provided this information. But it doesnt change  my 
decision. QuickQuid  was providing Mr M for short-term loans which  are designed  to have a 
short-term purpose.  But Mr M borrowed from QuickQuid for over a year,  without a significant  
break between repaying one loan and taking another. 
QuickQuids estimate of Mr Ms disposable income is at times much  higher than the 
repayments Mr M was due to make. Its difficult to place  much weight on these estimates as 
QuickQuid hasnt provided any of the underlying CRA data or otherwise  shown  exactly  how 
it arrived at its estimates. To give some  examples though, it said that for loans 8 and 9 
It thought Mr Ms disposable income  was £1,481 a month. If this is right, its difficult to see 
why Mr M was borrowing  so regularly and  for loan 8 at least  why he was borrowing 
relatively small sums a year into the second chain of borrowing. There was then no gap in 
between loan 8 and 9 and Mr M doubled the amount he borrowed,  despite the fact that 
QuickQuids estimate of his disposable income would apparently  leave him with a significant 
surplus after repaying it.
So the points  raised by QuickQuid havent  changed my mind and I think it ought to have 
realised further borrowing,  by the time of loan 5, was likely to be unsustainable or otherwise  
harmful for Mr M. Im therefore upholding the complaint about loans 5-10a.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr M paid on loan 5 and all subsequent loans
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr M paid them until the 
date of settlement
remove all information about loan 5 and all subsequent loans from Mr Ms credit 
history 
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking  the steps 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 May 2019.
