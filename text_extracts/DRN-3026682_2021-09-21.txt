The complaint
Mr M complains that on looking to voluntary terminate his hire purchase agreement
(agreement) with BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS), it advised him
incorrectly, on two separate occasions, the sum he needed to pay.
What happened
In September 2016, Mr M acquired a used car using a hire purchase agreement
(agreement) from BMWFS. The total repayable under the agreement was £36,195.66.
Mr M was required to make 47 monthly payments of £435.27 and there was a final optional
payment of £15,737.97 if he wished to buy the car at the end of the agreement.
The agreement set out that Mr M had the right to terminate the agreement at any time before
the final payment was due. In doing so, BMWFS would be entitled to the return of the car
and at least half of the total repayable under the agreement. The agreement set out this was
£18,097.83.
In December 2019 Mr M was offered a deal on a new car, a deal he accepts he found
attractive. So he telephoned BMWFS on 31 December 2019 and 3 January 2020 to enquire
what he would need to pay to voluntary terminate his existing agreement on his existing car
and on both occasions he was advised of an incorrect sum.
Mr M accepted the deal on the new car.
On 3 January 2020 BMWFS wrote to Mr M to say that payment of £687.03 was required to
voluntary terminate the agreement.
On 21 January 2020 BMWFS wrote to Mr M to say that payment of £2,091.87 was required
in respect of excess mileage.
On 27 January 2020 Mr M paid BMWFS the sum of £2,091.87 in respect of excess mileage.
On 13 February 2020, after Mr M had complained to BMWFS about being misadvised on
31 December 2019 and 3 January 2020 as to what he needed to pay to voluntary terminate
his agreement, BMWFS issued him with a final response letter (FRL).
Under cover of this FRL BMWFS accepted it had given Mr M incorrect information on
31 December 2019 and 3 January 2020, but said the figure of £687.03 it was seeking
payment of was correct. However, it went on to say it was prepared to reduce this sum of
£687.03 by £200 for the incorrect information it gave.
On 9 February 2021 BMWFS wrote to Mr M chasing payment of the £687.03. Under cover of
this letter BMWFS advised Mr M that non-payment might result in adverse information being
reported to credit reference agencies.
Mr M said that on receipt of the above letter he paid BMWFS the sum of £687.03, but he
later discovered that adverse information had already been recorded by BMWFS against his
name with credit reference agencies.
Mr Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that having
offered to reduce the agreement arrears by £200, BMWFS didnt need to do anything more.
Mr M disagreed. In summary he said:
BMWFS hadnt paid him the £200 offered under cover of its FRL.
It was wrong for the investigator to assume that he would have done nothing
differently had he not been misadvised by BMWFS.
He doesnt know what he might have done differently had he not been misadvised by
BMWFS, but he may have waited a further period of time such that nothing was due
from him on voluntary termination of his agreement.
BMWFS advised him that he would be required to pay it £251.76, yet he has ended
up paying it £1,122.30 (£435.27 by direct debit in January 2020 and £687.03 in, or
around, February 2021).
The investigator considered Mr Ms response to his view, but wasnt persuaded to change
his mind. Therefore Mr Ms complaint was passed to me for review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in August 2021.
In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr M has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mr M will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Mr M doesnt dispute the excess mileage charge he was invoiced for by BMWFS. Therefore
Im only considering in this decision Mr Ms complaint about the sum of £687.03 he was
invoiced for by BMWFS.
First, I would like to say that Im satisfied that regardless of what BMWFS advised Mr M over
the telephone on 31 December 2019 and 3 January 2020, Mr M did, on voluntary terminating
his agreement in mid-January 2020, owe BMWFS £687.03.
Under Mr Ms right to voluntary terminate his agreement he was  everything else being
equal  required to pay BMWFS £18,097.83 (50% of £36,195.66).
I can see that on the date Mr Ms voluntary termination request was posted by BMWFS to
his account, on 20 January 2021, Mr M had made 40 monthly payments of £435.27 totalling
£17,410.80  with the first payment being made on 1 October 2016 and the 40th payment
being made on 1 January 2020. This left £687.03 outstanding and due to BMWFS
(£18,097.83 - £17,410.80).So, put another way, Im satisfied that Mr M hasnt paid BMWFS, nor did BMWFS ever
request Mr M pay, anything more than he was obliged to pay under his voluntary termination
rights.
Our service hasnt been able to get the recordings of the calls made on 31 December 2019
and 3 January 2020, but this isnt surprising given the passage of time. However, I dont
think this is material to my consideration of this complaint. I say this because BMWFS
doesnt dispute that it gave Mr M incorrect information regarding what he would be required
to pay on voluntary terminating his agreement.
As I say above, it isnt in dispute that Mr M was given incorrect information by BMWFS on
31 December 2019 and 3 January 2020. I also accept that Mr M relied on this advice. But,
where someone has acted in reliance on a misrepresentation, the appropriate remedy isnt
to put them in the position they would be in if the misrepresentation had been true, but in the
position they would be in if the misrepresentation hadnt happened to begin with.
Now I accept I cant say for certain what Mr M would have done had he been advised on
31 December 2019 that if he wanted to voluntary terminate his agreement then he would be
required to make his 1 January 2020 direct debit payment of £435.27 followed by a further
payment of £687.03. Or what he would have done had he been advised on 3 January 2020
that having paid his 1 January 2020 direct debit payment of £435.27 he would be required to
pay a further £687.03.
But given Mr M says himself he was offered a good deal on a new car in December 2019
and he would be required to pay a not insignificant sum for excess mileage, Im simply not
persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, he would have done anything different. In other
words, Im satisfied that Mr M would have gone ahead and acquired the new car and
voluntary terminated his existing agreement by paying BMWFS £435.27 on 1 January 2020
(by direct debit) followed by a further payment of £687.03.
I also think its worth pointing out that if Mr M had delayed acquiring his new car until say
the middle of March 2020, its not clear that he would have been any better off financially. I
say this because although he wouldnt have been required to have paid BMWFS the sum of
£687.03, he would have paid it a further two monthly payments of £435.27 (on 1 February
and 1 March 2020).
Ive also seen insufficient evidence to suggest that had Mr M delayed acquiring his new car
until mid-March 2021 that he would have been able to acquire it for anything less than he
actually acquired it for in mid-January 2020.
Mr M says that BMWFS has unfairly reported, in respect of his agreement, adverse
information with credit reference agencies. However, as Mr M didnt pay all the sums which
fell due when he voluntary terminated the agreement, I cant reasonably say that what
BMWFS is reporting is either inaccurate, unfair or unreasonable.I would also add that although I can understand why Mr M might have been reluctant to pay
the sum of £687.03 being sought from him by BMWFS, I cant see that he was unable to pay
this sum because of financial difficulties for example.
Im also of the view that Mr M could and should have understood the consequences of not
paying the sum of £687.03 in a timely manner  this being the reporting to credit reference
agencies of adverse information  and that he could have paid this sum and then disputed
BMWFS right to seek it afterwards.
So given what I say above Im satisfied that BMWFS offer of £200 is, in all the
circumstances, both fair and reasonable.
BMWFS didnt respond to my provisional decision.
Mr M responded to my provisional decision to say that he didnt accept it. In doing so he 
reiterated his previous arguments and submissions, but provided nothing materially new for 
my consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed Mr Ms response to my provisional decision very carefully. However, Im 
satisfied that he hasnt provided anything materially new for my consideration, or anything 
that I hadnt already thought about when concluding what I did in my provisional decision.
However, for the sake of completeness and clarity, I would like to comment a little further on 
Mr Ms concern about the impact this whole matter has had on his credit file.
I accept that what prompted Mr M to pay the sum of £687.03 was BMWFSs letter dated 
9 February 2021, under cover of which it advised him that non-payment might result in 
adverse information being reported to credit reference agencies.
Its my understanding that BMWFS had already recorded adverse information about Mr Ms 
account with credit reference agencies before it sent its letter dated 9 February 2021. But Im 
not persuaded it was wrong to do so. I say this because Im satisfied that this sum was due 
and owing to BMWFS from January 2020 and that Mr M was aware, or should have 
reasonably been aware, that non-payment of this sum in, or shortly after, January 2020 
would result in adverse information being recorded with credit reference agencies. And 
based on what Mr M has said, this is precisely what happened. 
Given what I say above, and given that BMWFS didnt respond to my provisional decision, I 
see no good reason to depart from provisional findings and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that:
If Mr M has paid BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited the sum of £687.03 it should 
now pay Mr M £200.
If Mr M hasnt paid BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited the sum of £687.03, it 
should now reduce this sum by £200.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2021.
