The complaint
Mr S complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. His partner is also involved with his 
complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr S under a hire purchase agreement with Black Horse 
that he electronically signed in January 2019;
Black Horse, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr S - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr S was about three and a half years old, had been 
driven for 72,000 miles and had a price of £10,948;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr S complained to Black Horse about a number of issues with the car in November 
2019 and it sent him a detailed response the following month in which it said:
othe dealer had serviced the car after it was supplied to Mr S and had replaced 
the rear brake pads and discs as a gesture of goodwill  so it didnt uphold 
Mr Ss complaint about those issues;
oa manufacturers dealer had upgraded the cars software following a 
manufacturers recall so it didnt uphold his complaint about the recalls;
othat dealer had confirmed that the cars diesel particulate filter was unplugged 
when the cars mileage was 57,331 so it upheld his complaint about the filter 
and said that it would pay for it to be replaced; and
oit also offered to pay Mr S £141.49 to reimburse him for the £5 that hed paid 
to replace a battery in the key fob, the £35 that hed paid for a diagnostic 
report and £100 for his distress and inconvenience (with interest);
its clear that there have been some issues with the car - I can understand Mr Ss 
frustration about that and I sympathise with him for the difficulties that hes been 
caused;
the car should have been serviced before it was supplied to Mr S but the dealer 
serviced it when Mr S returned the car to it and it also replaced the rear brake discs 
and pads as a gesture of goodwill;
a manufacturers dealer upgraded the cars software following a manufacturers recall 
 Im not persuaded that the recall caused the car not to have been of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to Mr S;
the cars diesel particulate filter had been unplugged before the car was supplied to 
Mr S when its mileage was 57,331 - but Ive seen no evidence to show that the 
dealer or Black Horse knew that it had been unplugged until the car was inspected by 
a manufacturers dealer in November 2019 when its mileage was recorded as 
93,946;
Mr S had been able to use the car to drive more than 20,000 miles in about ten 
months and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Black Horse to allow him to reject the car;
Black Horse has offered to pay for the diesel particulate filter to be replaced and to 
pay to Mr S £141.49 as described above  and I consider that its offer that was made 
in December 2019 was an appropriate remedy for the issues with the car and was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
if Mr S now wants to accept that offer I suggest that he contacts Black Horse  but 
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay him a 
higher amount of compensation that its offered to him  or to take any action that it 
hasnt already offered to take in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2020.
