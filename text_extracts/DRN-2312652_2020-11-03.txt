The complaint
Mr T complains about what happened when he tried to get a refund for an item hed paid for
using PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA.
What happened
Mr T said he bought an item, and paid with it through PayPal. He said the item didnt arrive,
so he asked PayPal for a refund. It refused, it said that the seller had given it a tracking
number that showed the item had arrived. Mr T said that was the wrong number. That
tracking number was for items in a subsequent order, and hed shown PayPal this. But
despite Mr T repeatedly trying to complain, PayPal wouldnt do anything.
Mr T said he was out of pocket by $287.04. He said hed spent a considerable amount of
time trying to resolve this. He said he wanted a refund, and compensation for the time and
effort hed put in.
When Mr T wrote to us, PayPal hadnt sent him a final response letter. It sent him a letter
after our service contacted it. In that letter, it said it was sorry about the misunderstanding.
The seller had sent a tracking number for a different transaction with Mr T. Hed placed three
orders with the same seller, and received the items for the first and the last of those three
orders. PayPal said it could see that Mr Ts card company had refunded him for the
transaction, but it offered to pay for the cost of calls.
Mr T said he didnt receive this letter from PayPal. When our service sent it to Mr T, he said
he couldnt read it. The format in which PayPal sent this to us is difficult to read. PayPal also
sent this to Mr T again, I dont know if this was also sent in the same format, so it may have
been equally difficult to read. Mr T was then able to find this response, through the sent
messages part of PayPals website.
PayPal has since increased its offer to £100.
Mr T has said he wants PayPal to pay him back for this transaction, and says that what his
card company has done has nothing to do with PayPal. Mr T said hed only received a
percentage of the missing amount from his card provider, and that had only just been paid
after several months.
Our investigator asked Mr T to show us that he hadnt had all his money back from his card
provider, but Mr T didnt do that. PayPal has told us it is confident Mr T has received a full
refund.
Our investigator explained to Mr T that the money he had got back from his card provider
comes from PayPal. Thats the same, whether the money goes from PayPal via Mr Ts card
company then to him, or directly to him from PayPal. And our investigator said it wouldnt be
fair for Mr T to get this money back twice, so he needed to see if Mr Ts card company had
already made a refund. Mr T confirmed that hed had the money back, and said he wouldve
appreciated knowing that this money came from PayPal earlier.
Our investigator said when PayPal wrote to Mr T, it had asked him not to reply to that email
address, but send his reply elsewhere. Mr T did reply to that email address, and our
investigator didnt think it was unreasonable that PayPal didnt see this reply at the time.
But our investigator also said that Mr T had shown the tracking number hed been given by
the seller was different to the one it gave PayPal. Our investigator thought the information
confirming the tracking number was actually for a different transaction. So he thought PayPal
couldve looked more closely at the information it was sent, and if it had, then it might have
reached this conclusion too, and Mr Ts claim may have been handled better.
Our investigator said that Mr T had received the money for this transaction back from his
card provider. It wouldnt be fair to require PayPal to pay this money back too. PayPal had
offered £100 in compensation to Mr T, and our investigator thought that provided a fair and
reasonable outcome to the complaint, so he wouldnt ask it to do more than this.
Mr T didnt agree. He said that we were ignoring that hed phoned PayPal repeatedly to
explain, and sent it emails to say what was happening. He thought we were just accepting
what PayPal had said.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
I agree with our investigator, that PayPal doesnt have to repay the money that Mr T 
spent on this transaction now. Thats because it has already paid, via Mr Ts card 
company. I dont think it would be fair to ask PayPal to refund this money twice.
But, like our investigator, I dont think this complaint was handled very well.
PayPal has said that part of the reason that things went wrong on Mr Ts claim, was 
because when PayPal asked Mr T about the tracking information that it had been 
sent from the seller, Mr T used the wrong email address. But Mr T has told us that he 
complained, both in writing and on the phone, repeatedly. And PayPal told us it 
denied his appeal.
Like our investigator, I think PayPal had the information it needed to resolve this 
fairly. It had a tracking number from Mr T, which showed an undelivered parcel sent 
in July. It had tracking information from the seller, showing a delivered parcel first 
sent in August. Both these transactions were made through PayPal, so I think PayPal 
ought to have realised it had been given the wrong tracking information by the seller.
I also note that Mr T asked repeatedly for a final response from PayPal. And it seems 
as if PayPal didnt provide any formal response, or acknowledge that it had made a 
mistake, until this complaint came to us.
I dont think that Mr T should have to bring a complaint to us just to get PayPal to 
accept that it had made a mistake. For that reason, I dont think PayPals offer of 
£100 is quite enough to make up for whats gone wrong here. I think PayPal should 
pay Mr T £150 in compensation. I think that would provide a fair and reasonable 
outcome to this complaint. I understand PayPal hasnt yet paid the money it offered 
to Mr T, but if it has, it can offset that against my award.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both sides replied. What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr T said he was happy with my provisional decision. He would accept a total of £150 for 
this complaint. He wanted to clarify that hed never been seeking to recover both from his 
credit card company and from PayPal. He just wanted to make sure it was PayPal who was 
paying him back. He now understood that this was what had happened. 
PayPal said it would pay Mr T £150, but it didnt want our service to decide this complaint 
against it. It said it had made every effort to resolve this for Mr T. 
PayPal said it had offered Mr T £100 in compensation once the case came to us, but Mr T 
wouldnt accept it. At that point, he was looking for a full refund of the transaction, which 
PayPal said hed already received from his credit card company. It felt that £100 for the 
customer service issues Mr T had experienced was a very fair offer. And Mr T had said he 
would accept £100, once he had recovered the full amount hed originally paid. So PayPal 
thought that Mr T had found this offer of £100 acceptable.
PayPal also said it had worked Mr Ts buyer protection claim in line with its procedures on 
such cases. The seller had provided a tracking number which they stated was related to the 
transaction Mr T was claiming for, and, though PayPal said it is reasonable to assume that 
the tracking number was for a different transaction due to the date of sending, it could not 
confirm this. The seller was not in touch with PayPal to change it so PayPal could have only 
assumed that it was correct. PayPal said this meant it could not reverse the decision and 
took it that the seller was providing correct information.
I have considered what PayPal said carefully, but I still think this complaint should be upheld. 
It may assist PayPal if I explain a little about how our service deals with cases, and when we 
would uphold. 
PayPal made its offer to Mr T, of £100, well after our service had become involved in this 
case. Even if I thought that was enough to put things right in this case (which I dont) this 
complaint would still be upheld. Thats because PayPal hadnt done enough to put things 
right before the case was brought to us.
Although Mr T may have indicated at one point that he would be minded to accept PayPals 
offer of £100 in the future, he did not then do so. And the negotiation period on this case has 
now passed, without reaching a resolution which was acceptable to both sides. So the case 
has come to me for a final decision. 
Ive considered the case carefully, and decided that PayPal should pay Mr T £150, for the 
reasons I set out above. Upholding this complaint is part of making that award. And I think 
its entirely appropriate, and in keeping with the usual operation of our service, to do so here.
I also note PayPal now accepts that the information the seller gave it about Mr Ts 
transactions was unlikely to be correct. But it appears to suggest that its procedures left it no 
choice but to accept what the seller said, and refuse Mr Ts claim. This seems contradictory. 
I dont think that fits well with PayPals suggestion that it, as an organisation, had made 
every effort to resolve this for Mr T.
Ive reconsidered this case, but Ive not changed my mind. Ill now make the award I 
originally proposed. My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Mr T a total of £150 for 
this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2020.
