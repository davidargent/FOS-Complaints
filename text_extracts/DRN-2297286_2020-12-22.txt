DRN-2297286
The complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt take him seriously when he 
complained about possible fraudulent transactions. Mr D also complains that PayPal didnt 
help him to resolve the problems on his account, and their process for handling customer 
complaints was poor. 
What happened
Mr D had a PayPal account. He had a direct debit in place, so that any payments from his 
PayPal account would automatically be charged to his current account with Bank H. 
On 15 December 2019 Bank H made an error  they reversed payments totalling £5,038.98 
from PayPal and credited this amount back to Mr Ds bank account. Mr D didnt know 
anything about this until 8 January 2020, when he noticed strange activity on his PayPal 
account. Between 6.50pm and 7.50pm that day Mr D saw between 40 and 50 bank reversal 
cases had been raised. He began to receive lots of emails  notifications from PayPal about 
bank reversals and messages from distressed people whod had payments taken back even 
though theyd supplied him with goods. And his PayPal account suddenly showed a negative 
balance, saying he owed £1,134.36.
Mr D thought this must be a scam  he knew he hadnt questioned these transactions and 
he couldnt possibly have raised that many disputes so quickly. He contacted PayPal for 
help. But PayPal told him there was nothing they could do  they said the disputed cases 
must have been raised either by Mr D or his bank. Mr D also contacted Bank H, who 
admitted theyd made an error. On 16 January 2020 Bank H credited £5,038.98 back to 
PayPal. But Mr Ds PayPal account didnt change  it still showed the same negative 
balance.
Mr D made formal complaints to PayPal, Bank H and to us. PayPal said theyd done nothing 
wrong, so one of our investigators looked in to what had happened. As a result of that 
investigation, PayPal confirmed that the money had been returned, and credited it to Mr Ds 
account. But they said they were unable to reverse all the disputed cases that had been 
raised  Mr D would need to repay these himself.
Although this problem was caused by Bank H, our investigator thought PayPal had an 
obligation to try to help Mr D. And that, when PayPal learnt that Bank H had returned the 
money, they should have made enquiries to try to locate where it had gone. The investigator 
recommended PayPal pay £200 compensation to Mr D.
PayPal agreed, but Mr D was unhappy that they hadnt put his account back the way it was 
before and resolved all the reversals. Mr D thought that, as PayPal had reversed the 
transactions, he shouldnt have to put things right himself. He also thought £200 wasnt 
enough compensation for the amount of work this would involve.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not disputed that Mr Ds problems started due to an error made by his bank. Mr D made 
a separate complaint about Bank H, so Im not going to discuss that here. But I need to 
consider whether PayPal treated Mr D fairly when he contacted them for help with the 
problems on his account.
All direct debit arrangements are covered by the direct debit guarantee, which is there to 
protect customers if theres been an error with a payment. If a customer queries a payment, 
they get an immediate refund from their bank. In turn, the bank gets the money back from 
the originator  in this case PayPal. This is called the direct debit indemnity. 
In this case Bank H claimed lots of payments back from PayPal under the direct debit 
indemnity. When a bank reverses a payment, PayPal treats this as a disputed transaction 
and reclaims the money from the merchant. In this case Bank Hs reversals affected 
between 40 and 50 PayPal transactions over a period of more than two months. Im satisfied 
that PayPal had no reason to suspect that Bank H had reversed these payments in error, so 
they didnt do anything wrong by following their usual process for disputed transactions. 
I can see why Mr D felt PayPal hadnt taken his complaint seriously when he told them about 
possible fraud on his account. But PayPal would have known that the reversals had been 
made under the direct debit indemnity, so again Im satisfied that they didnt do anything 
wrong here.
 
Bank H tried to correct their error by sending the money back to PayPal in January 2020. 
Although PayPal havent provided evidence of what this transaction looked like, I understand 
that the money wasnt directed to Mr Ds account. I appreciate that PayPal is a very large 
organisation, handling huge numbers of transactions every day. But I dont think its 
unreasonable to expect PayPal to have queried this unrecognised transaction with Bank H. 
Mr D says he couldnt understand why his account was still showing a negative balance after 
Bank H had returned the money. It was left in PayPals suspense account until it was 
discovered in July 2020, after our investigator prompted them to search for it. So, although 
they didnt cause the problem, I find PayPals failure to check or trace the returned payment 
to be the reason Mr Ds account problems continued for the next six months. 
PayPal sent their final response to Mr Ds complaint on 19 February 2020. They agreed to 
hold off their debt collectors to allow him time to resolve the problem. But they just referred 
him back to his bank to get the problem sorted. Mr Ds bank had already returned the 
payment to PayPal a month earlier. If PayPal had queried this unrecognised transaction 
when it arrived, Im satisfied that their response to Mr Ds complaint is likely to have been 
different. 
I can understand that Mr D feels frustrated that PayPal havent repaid the customers whose 
transactions were reversed  they told him he needs to do this himself. PayPal have 
provided a list of the transactions that were affected so that he can work through them. I 
have great sympathy for Mr Ds situation  none of this was his fault. Unfortunately, PayPal 
dont have a mechanism to undo the reversed transactions automatically. And as they 
werent to blame for the incorrect reversals, it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to direct 
PayPal to put them right for Mr D.  
Putting things rightI think Mr Ds problems could have been resolved a lot quicker if PayPal had taken basic 
steps to check on the returned payment from Bank H. Until that money was found he was 
unable to use his PayPal account. Its clear that Mr D has spent a considerable amount of 
time trying to resolve the issues with PayPal. And in the meantime, leaving people unpaid for 
goods theyd supplied has caused him a considerable amount of stress and upset. I think 
PayPal should compensate him for this.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained here, my final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
should pay £200 compensation to Mr D, if they havent done so already. 
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2021.
