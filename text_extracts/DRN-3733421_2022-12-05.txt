The complaint
Mrs H complains that Currys Group Limited (Currys) failed to ensure credit, that it had 
brokered on her behalf, was reduced by £82 from £1,082.96 to £1,000.96.
Mrs H is represented in this complaint by a third party. But for ease I will simply refer to
Mrs H throughout this decision rather than Mrs H and her representative.
What happened
In September 2014 Mrs H purchased an item from Currys. Mrs H purchased this item with 
credit brokered on her behalf by Currys with a company that I will call C.
Based on system notes provided by C, and what the parties have said and submitted,
its my understanding that the cost of the item was £1,082,96 and Mrs H agreed to make an
advance payment of £108.30 (10%) followed by:
a single payment of £974.66 on or before 25 March 2015  total payable £974.66; or
36 monthly payments of £41.84 commencing April 2015 ending March 2018  total
payable £1,506.24
Mrs H sent C a cheque for £919.66, which was credited to her account on 6 March 2015. 
Mrs H submits that the reason she sent Creation £919.66 (rather than £974.66) was 
because:
the sum of £974.66 was inclusive of an installation fee of £82
Currys was unable to install the item
Currys advised her that it would ensure an appropriate adjustment (for the lack of 
install) would be made to the finance agreement with C
On 26 March 2015 Mrs Hs account balance, she having only paid C £919.66 before this 
date (rather than £974.66), stood at £586.58 (£1,506.24 less £919.66).
Between April 2015 and September 2015 Mrs H paid C 6 monthly payments of £41.84 
totalling £251.04, taking her account balance down to £335.54.
In August 2017, and having received no further payments from Mrs H, C raised a charge 
against Mrs Hs account of £30, taking the balance on it to £365.54.
In December 2017 Mrs H contacted Currys to complain that it had failed to ensure credit that 
it had brokered on her behalf had been reduced by £82 from £1,082.96 to £1,000.96.
In February 2018 Currys wrote to Mrs H to say it didnt believe it had done anything wrong.
In April 2018 Currys, as a gesture of goodwill, offered Mrs H £122.40 which she didnt 
accept.
In May 2019, and having received no further payments from Mrs H, C sold the debt
onto a debt collector that I will call L.
In August 2020 Mrs H complained to Currys for a second time.
In October 2020 Currys wrote to Mrs H to say its offer of £122.40, made as a gesture of 
goodwill in April 2018, was still available for acceptance.
In March 2021 Mrs H referred a compliant to our service, which was considered by one of
our investigators.
In July and August 2022 our investigator wrote to Mrs H to say that he wasnt upholding her
complaint against Currys.
Mrs H disagreed with the investigators decision not to uphold her complaint against Currys, 
so it has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First I would like to make it clear that Im only considering in this complaint what, if anything,
Currys might have done wrong in its brokering of Mrs Hs credit. Im not considering anything 
C might or might not have done wrong, something that is being considered by our service as 
a separate complaint.
Secondly, I would like to point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear,
or contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
I appreciate Mrs H will be disappointed, but like the investigator Im satisfied that Currys has 
done nothing wrong in the particular circumstances of this case.
Even if I was to find that Currys agreed to refund the installation cost, and should have done 
so, Ive seen insufficient evidence that Currys ever agreed to arrange for the credit it 
brokered to be reduced by that refunded cost. Indeed, in cases such as this its my 
understanding that its normal practice for a retailer to refund anything due to a consumer 
directly, leaving them the freedom to do what they like with the money.
I would also add that based on what both parties have said and submitted, Ive seen 
insufficient evidence that would lead me to conclude that Mrs H contacted Currys before 
December 2017 about an installation charge refund. So even if I was to find that Currys 
should have arranged for the credit it brokered to be reduced by the cost of installation, 
which for the avoidance of doubt I dont, its my understanding that Mrs Hs account with C 
was already substantially in arrears with adverse information recorded with credit reference 
agencies.
Finally, I think its worth pointing out that it was Mrs Hs choice to pay C £919.66 (rather than 
£974.66) without making enquiries of C (or Currys) to establish whether this would be 
acceptable and whether it would have any adverse consequences for her.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint and I leave it to Mrs H to decide whether, on 
reflection, she would like to accept (and assuming its still available for acceptance) Currys 
offer of £122.40.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
