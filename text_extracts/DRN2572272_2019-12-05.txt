K821x#15complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage Miss K holds with Southern Pacific Mortgage  Limited  
(SPML). Shes  unhappy with how SPML treated her when she was in long-term  financial 
difficulties; specifically shes  complained about the fees and charges that have been  added 
to her account. These have increased her balance and reduced  her equity.
background
In what follows, I have  summarised events in rather  less detail than theyve been presented, 
using my own words to do so, and rounding the numbers  involved. No discourtesys 
intended by that. Its a reflection of the informal service we provide, and if I dont  mention  
something, it wont be because Ive ignored  it. Itll be because I didnt think  it was material to 
the outcome of the complaint. 
This approach is consistent with what our enabling legislation requires of me. It allows  me to 
focus on the issues on which I consider a fair outcome will turn, and not be side-tracked by 
matters which, although presented as material, are, in my opinion peripheral.  Another reason 
I have left out a lot of the detail is to avoid the risk of identifying Miss K when my decision is 
published.
Miss K has struggled with the payments for most  of the time shes  had the mortgage; at one 
stage, SPML  obtained a possession order, but it hasnt been enforced.  In 2018, Miss K 
complained to us about the charges; initially, she was represented by a firm of solicitors,  but 
Miss K now brings the complaint directly.
We began  by explaining to Miss K that we would only be able to consider the charges 
charged since March  2012.  Miss K accepted that events  prior to that date were time-barred  
under our rules, and so our investigator  focussed on what  had happened since. Broadly  
speaking, he concluded that SPML hadnt  treated Miss K unfairly, but when he analysed  the 
fees and charges it had added to her account, he decided that some of them should be 
refunded, backdated  for interest purposes. 
A list of the charges  recommended for refund is attached to, and forms part of, this decision.  
He also recommended SPML pay Miss K £250 compensation for her time and trouble. 
Miss K has accepted  the proposed settlement but SPML would like an ombudsman  to review  
the complaint.
my findings
Ill start with some  general  observations. Were  not the regulator  of financial businesses, and 
we dont police their internal  processes  or how they operate generally. Thats the job of the 
Financial Conduct  Authority. We deal with individual  disputes between businesses  and their 
customers. In doing  that, we dont replicate the work  of the courts. 
Were impartial, and we dont take either  sides instructions on how we investigate  a 
complaint. We conduct our investigations  and reach our conclusions  without interference 
from anyone else. But in doing so, we have  to work  within the rules of the ombudsman 
service, and the remit those rules  give us
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN25722722The starting point  is that lenders generally are permitted under the mortgage terms to apply 
fees and charges to cover  the additional cost of administering a mortgage  account that is in 
arrears. Such charges are typically set out in a separate tariff of charges. 
But lenders  also have a duty to treat customers fairly, and even where  fees have been 
applied in accordance with the account terms and the tariff of charges, well still give 
separate consideration to whether theyve been applied fairly.  One situation  where  we 
generally find that arrears  fees or charges  havent been applied  fairly is if more than one 
charge has been  levied in the same  month. 
Another is if a charge  is levied in a month where the customer has paid either the contractual 
payment or a different  amount agreed as part of a payment arrangement. In Miss Ks case,  
the investigator identified several occasions  where charges had been applied  in months 
where one or other of the above guidelines  had been breached.  
In asking for a review,  SPML  hasnt tried to dispute  our broad approach. Its happy to make 
the majority of the refunds the investigator has recommended. What it has done, however, is 
said that it doesnt believe the direct  debit fees from 2012  should  be included  in the refund. 
Thats because the rule about  not charging  twice  for rejected direct debits in one month was 
only introduced  into the Mortgage and Home Finance Conduct of Business Rules  (MCOB) in 
2014.
Ive thought hard about that, and overall,  Im not persuaded the investigator was wrong to 
recommend the direct  debit fees from 2012 be included in the refund. The reason is that 
whilst the reason for it may only have  become  a specific  provision in MCOB in 2014,  the 
intention of that provision  was in effect, to codify what was already regarded as good  
practice and fair treatment.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I direct Southern 
Pacific Mortgage Limited to refund the arrears management fees listed below, backdated for 
interest purposes, and pay Miss K £250 compensation. 
My final decision concludes this services consideration of this complaint, which means Ill 
not be engaging in any further discussion of the merits of it.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 January 2020.
