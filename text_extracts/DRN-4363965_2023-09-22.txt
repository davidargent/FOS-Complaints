The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refuses to refund his losses 
after he fell victim to a scam.
What happened
Mr T has explained that around early July 2022, he saw an advert on social media and 
registered his details. He was subsequently called by a financial advisor, and he was 
persuaded to make a number of payments from his NatWest account for what he 
subsequently realised was a cryptocurrency investment scam. 
Some of the payments were sent initially to an account with another UK regulated business 
(which Ill call W). The payments were then sent on to an account in his own name with a 
cryptocurrency exchange (which Ill call N), then sent on to the scammer. Some payments 
were sent directly from NatWest to N. N was a legitimate business and there is no 
suggestion it was involved in the scam. Mr T also mentioned he paid an initial deposit on his 
credit card. 
Mr T also applied for and took out a loan with NatWest to send further funds to the scammer. 
The scammer assured him that he didnt need to worry about repaying the loan given the 
returns he would receive from the scam. When Mr T was asked to take out a further loan to 
send to the scammers, despite not having had any funds returned to him, Mr T realised hed 
been scammed. My understanding is that he hasnt been able to retrieve the money lost to 
the scammers. 
Mr T subsequently reported the scam to NatWest and asked for the money he lost to be 
reimbursed. NatWest said it had flagged several transactions as suspicious and spoke to 
Mr T, asking him questions with a view to ascertaining whether he was at risk of being 
scammed  at one point asking him to visit branch to verify his story. Mr T was dishonest 
and misled NatWest, so it wasnt able to discover the scam. So, NatWest refused to 
reimburse Mr T for his losses. 
Unhappy with this, Mr T referred a complaint about NatWest to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service. Our investigator looked at what happened. She largely agreed that NatWest had 
carried out appropriate interventions and wasnt able to discover the scam during its earlier 
intervention calls. However, she felt the final intervention (on 14 July 2022) was inadequate. 
Mr T had on an earlier call told NatWest that he was sending funds to his account with W for 
home improvements. When this was returned by W, Mr T tried to transfer these same 
amounts to N directly. NatWest again called Mr T, but despite Mr T being dishonest on the 
call, our investigator felt NatWest ought to have realised that Mr T was being dishonest.  The 
same funds that Mr T had told NatWest was for home improvements were now being sent to 
N. Our investigator felt that, as the expert, NatWest ought to have been aware that 
consumers are often coached to lie to their bank by scammers.  NatWest should therefore 
have probed further given the clear discrepancy in Mr Ts testimony. Had it done so, it could 
have warned Mr T, that scammers telling their victims to lie to their bank was a common 
theme of investment scams and no legitimate business would tell its customers to lie to their 
bank. It therefore would have discovered the scam and stopped the payment as well as 
those that followed. 
Our investigator felt that NatWest should therefore refund the payments made to the 
scammer from 14 July 2022 onwards. However, she also felt that Mr T should be 
responsible for some of the loss in this case. She explained that Mr T had repeatedly lied to 
NatWest and had sent significant funds to a party he did not know without seeking any 
advice. So, she said the redress should be reduced by 50%. She added that NatWest should 
also refund any interest charged on the loan amount being refunded, and that the refunds 
could be offset against the loan. She further clarified NatWest should also refund any 
overpayments Mr T made towards the loan and pay 8% interest on the refund amount. 
NatWest agreed with our investigators view of the complaint. But Mr T didnt agree. He said 
that he was a loyal customer and was manipulated by the scammers. He explained that he 
had suffered significant distress and financial loss  he felt leaving him in debt was unfair. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved, it has been passed to me.
In my provisional decision of 7 September 2023, I set out why I was minded to partially 
upholding the complaint. I invited both parties to provide any further submissions they may 
wish to make before I reached a final decision. NatWest replied and after clarifying its 
understanding of redress, said it would be happy to resolve the case in accordance with the 
provisional findings set out. Mr T did not reply.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I explained the following: 
currently I intend to uphold this complaint in part for broadly the same reasons as our 
investigator, and Ill explain why. 
To begin with, where customers authorise payments from their accounts, businesses such 
as NatWest are under an obligation to process such transfers. If consumers are the victim of 
a scam (like Mr T), the starting point is that consumers are responsible. To be clear, 
NatWest did not scam Mr T and it is not the perpetrator of the scam. 
However, financial businesses also have a duty to try to prevent their customers falling 
victim to scams. Businesses therefore need to strike a balance between intervening in 
payments to prevent scams or financial harm, against the risk of unnecessarily 
inconveniencing or delaying legitimate transactions. 
In order to uphold a complaint of this nature, Id need to be satisfied that NatWest had failed 
in its duty of care towards Mr T, and had it instead done what it should have done, it could 
have prevented the loss. 
The first few payments Mr T sent were less than £1,000 and otherwise unremarkable. So, I 
dont think its unfair that NatWest didnt flag these as unusual. But when Mr T sent a third 
payment of £3,100 to N after two earlier payments on the same day (7 July 2022), NatWest 
correctly stopped this payment and contacted Mr T to discuss its concerns. NatWest asked 
Mr T a series of questions with a view to determining whether he was potentially being 
scammed but Mr T mis-led NatWest. He told NatWest that the account with N was 
recommended by a friend, that he was buying Bitcoin and acting independently. On further questioning, Mr T again confirmed that no third parties had called or emailed him, that the 
money was going to his own account, and that his previous payments had been received 
into the account. He also told NatWest that he didnt know any return rates as he had only 
started trading and will see how it goes. He finally, confirmed again no third parties had 
asked him to transfer the money. NatWest still gave him a scam warning and informed him 
that he may not be able to get the money back if he proceeded. Mr T went ahead with the 
transfer. 
I think this intervention call was reasonable but, despite NatWests efforts, it wasnt able to 
discover the scam. 
On 8 July 2022 Mr T successfully applied for a loan of £20,000 from NatWest for home 
improvements. On the same day, he tried to transfer £15,000 of the loan money to his 
account with W, but this was stopped by NatWest. NatWest called Mr T and spoke to him, 
and he confirmed the money was being sent to his account with W, and it would then be sent 
to his home country for home improvements (which is in line with the purpose of the loan). 
NatWest asked Mr T to visit branch with ID, which he did. While at the branch, staff 
witnessed Mr T logging into his account with W, using his phone. NatWest then carried out 
another intervention call, and due to branch staff being satisfied the Mr T had access to his 
account with W, and Mr T assuring it that he was using the money for home improvements, 
NatWest agreed to process the payment. However, £14,900 of this sum was returned by W. 
On 13 July 2022, Mr W sent £5,000 to N. However, by this time N had become an 
established payee and Mr W had significant amounts of money going in and out of his 
account. So, I dont think this payment alone stands out as unusual and I dont think its 
unreasonable that NatWest didnt flag this payment as suspicious. 
On 14 July 2022, Mr T tried to make further payments to N. As these were being sent in 
short succession and only a day after the £5,000 on the 13 July 2022, NatWest blocked 
three transactions and contacted Mr T. He said the payments to N were to trade, that hed 
done it before, and was happy the money was being received into his account. He also 
confirmed no one had asked him to transfer the money. NatWest therefore allowed the 
payments to N to be sent. 
This call, as a standalone intervention call, doesnt appear particularly inadequate. However, 
I have to assess all the information available to NatWest bearing in mind it is the expert and 
should be familiar with the usual themes of these types of scams  one of which is 
consumers being told to lie to their bank. NatWest could see that the £15,000 was originally 
supposed to be sent to W for home improvements, that this money was returned by W, and 
these same funds were now being sent to N. Like our investigator says, I think it had enough 
information available to it that it ought to have realised that Mr T may be mis-leading it and 
probed further to find out what was really happening. Had it done so, it seems probable that 
on further questioning and providing context of the common themes of this type of scam, 
Mr T would have been alerted about the scam in time and stopped the payment in its tracks. 
So, I think an intervention likely would have prevented this loss and the ones that followed. 
So, I think NatWest should refund the payments made from 14 July 2022 onwards. 
Ive gone on to consider whether Mr Ts redress should be reduced for contributory 
negligence. I believe Mr T was a victim of a scam and also that he trusted the scammer.
But I also have to bear in mind that Mr T transferred substantial sums of money to the 
scammers in a short space of time. He sent this money to an unregulated business, without 
seeking any formal financial advice, and without having had any previously dealings with it. 
Mr T also accepted he had doubts from the start and tried to get his initial deposit back but 
was instead persuaded to invest. In my view, Mr T ought to have recognised that there was some risk in sending that much 
money to an unknown and unregulated company in addition to his own doubts about the 
scammers. I think he ignored these doubts unreasonably. He also repeatedly lied to 
NatWest. While I sympathise with his position, for the reasons explained above, I still think 
he should bear some liability for the loss because he hasnt acted reasonably considering all 
the circumstances of this case. So, I think NatWest can deduct 50% from his redress award 
in recognition of this. 
Mr T used money from his loan with NatWest to make the payments from 14 July 2022 
onwards. So, I think NatWest should refund the interest charged on the portion of the loan 
being refunded from 14 July 2022. If Mr T has made any repayments to the loan, NatWest 
should refund overpayments made towards the portion of the loan being refunded and 8% 
interest should be added on any amounts refunded. 
I understand the experience has caused Mr T significant distress and inconvenience. While I 
am very sorry for the difficulties he has experienced, ultimately it was the scammer who was 
responsible for his suffering. And whilst I have concluded NatWest most likely could have 
prevented some of the payments, Ive also explained why I think a 50% reduction to the 
compensation due to contributory negligence is appropriate. Bearing all of this in mind, 
overall, Im satisfied the award I have set out here represents a fair outcome to this case, so 
I dont intend to make an additional award for distress and inconvenience.  
Ive also thought about the payment Mr T made on his credit card that he says was related to 
the scam. I can see Mr T paid a deposit of €250 on his credit card to a different merchant. 
But this payment was refunded by the merchant a few weeks later so I dont think NatWest 
needs to do anything further about this payment. 
Putting things right 
NatWest should pay Mr T:
1. A refund of 50% of the scam payments made by Mr T from the 14 July 2022. 
2. As these payments came from a NatWest loan, NatWest should also refund the 
interest it charged on the portion of the loan being refunded from 14 July 2022. 
The above refunds should be off set against the loan, so Mr Ts debt is reduced by that 
amount.
 
3. If Mr T has made any repayments towards the loan since 14 July 2022, NatWest 
should refund any overpayments made. (NatWest only needs to refund the portion of 
repayments that were made towards the portion of the loan being refunded.)
4. 8% interest should be added on any amounts refunded.
If NatWest deducts tax from any interest, it should provide the Mr T with the appropriate tax 
deduction certificate.
NatWest replied to my provisional decision explaining that Mr T had only made one payment 
to the loan. So, we explained to both NatWest and Mr T that, given Mr T hadnt made the 
usual monthly payments under the loan, we didnt think it was necessary for NatWest to 
work out any overpayments made to the loan. We explained the remaining part of the 
redress order would remain the same but for any further comments made by either party. 
NatWest replied agreeing to put matters right in accordance with my findings while Mr T 
made no comments. In the absence of any new points for me to consider, I find no reason to depart from my original findings as set out in my provisional decision with the redress 
adjusted so NatWest does not have to refund any overpayments made to the loan. 
Summary 
NatWest does not have to refund the payments Mr T made before 14 July 2022, as I 
dont think it failed in its duty of care towards Mr T. In my view, NatWest carried out 
appropriate interventions but did not discover the scam. 
I think NatWest should refund the payments Mr T made after 14 July 2022 as despite 
Mr T mis-leading it, it ought to have been aware that sometimes consumers are told 
by scammers to mislead their banks. Overall, I think NatWest had enough 
information to ascertain that Mr T had not been forthcoming with the truth. I therefore 
think it could have discovered the scam at this stage and prevented the losses that 
followed on from this date. 
NatWest can reduce the redress by 50% for contributory negligence as Mr T had not 
behaved reasonably in all the circumstances of the case, so I think its fair for Mr T to 
also bear some of the loss. 
Putting things right 
NatWest must:
1. Refund 50% of the scam payments made by Mr T from the 14 July 2022. 
2. As these payments came from a NatWest loan, NatWest should also refund the 
interest it charged on the portion of the loan being refunded from 14 July 2022. 
The above refunds should be off set against the loan, so Mr Ts debt is reduced by that 
amount.
If NatWest deducts tax from any interest, it should provide the Mr T with the appropriate tax 
deduction certificate.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold this complaint in part. National Westminster Bank Plc 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2023.
