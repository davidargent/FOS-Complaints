The complaint
Mr N is unhappy as he believes that NewDay Ltd did not accurately report the status of his 
account to a credit reference agency.
What happened
Mr N held a branded credit card which was administered by NewDay. In September 2019, 
Mr N contacted NewDay and asked them to close his account. NewDay were unable to 
immediately comply with Mr Ns request, as there was a credit balance of approximately Â£15. 
NewDay say that as Mr Ns account was ultimately closed it has now been purged from their 
systems, and so they cant confirm the exact dates of when they returned the balance to Mr 
N and closed the account, or when they subsequently updated the credit reference agency, 
but they believe that all of these events took place in November 2019. 
NewDay say this because their records show a telephone call logged on 6 November 2019 
and a letter sent to Mr N by NewDay on 21 November 2019 advising Mr N that the account 
was closed as requested.
In February 2020, Mr N complained to NewDay that his credit file had not been updated to 
show that the account was closed. NewDay looking into the matter and responded to Mr N in 
March 2020. NewDay said that as the account had been in closed in November 2019, they 
would have updated the credit reference agency at the end of that month, as their process is 
to update credit reference agencies at the end of every month.
NewDay also said that it can take up to 90 days for a credit reference agency to update a 
credit file once they have received information. This would mean that Mr Ns credit file may 
not be updated by the credit reference agency until 90 days after the end of November 2019. 
NewDay noted that Mr N had made his complaint before this 90-day period from the end of 
November 2019 had expired, and this may behave been why his credit file was not showing 
up to date information. At the time that NewDay responded to Mr Ns complaint, toward the 
end of March 2020, this 90-day period had expired, and NewDay confirmed that Mr Ns 
credit file had been updated to show that the account was closed at that time. 
NewDay explained the above to Mr N in their complaint response, and as their position was 
that they had updated the credit reference agency in a timely manner, they didnt uphold Mr 
Ns complaint. Mr N was unhappy with this response and referred the matter to our service.
One of investigators looked at this case. They thought that the explanation provided by 
NewDay was fair and reasonable, and so they didnt uphold the complaint either. Mr N 
remained dissatisfied and requested that the matter be passed to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand Mr Ns dissatisfaction at the length of time it took for his credit file to be 
updated correctly. However, having considered both sides of thus complaint, Im in 
agreement with the view put forward by our investigator - that the explanation provided by 
NewDay as to why the delay may have occurred is reasonable - and it appears more likely 
than not that NewDay did update the credit reference agency in a timely manner. 
Updating a credit file isnt an instant process and it can take some time. Thats because 
while NewDay is responsible for telling the relevant credit reference agencies what should 
be recorded, the agencies themselves have to update their records. Its those records that a 
customer will see.
So the 90-day timeframe NewDay gives seem to be intended to manage customers 
expectation in relation to this. NewDay did ultimately report the relevant information here to 
the credit reference agencies in a way that meant Mr Ns credit file was updated within the 
timeframe it stated.
But 90-days is a long time for a customer to wait  so Ive gone on to consider the impact of 
this on Mr H. Considering the circumstances of this complaint, it would be unusual for a 
credit card with a positive balance to have a negative impact on a persons credit rating, and 
any recent historical negative balances would be visible on the credit report whether the 
credit card was showing as opened or closed. 
So in this instance, regardless of how the delay in updating the credit file occurred, I cant 
see that this has had any obvious impact on Mr N in a way that means NewDay should have 
to take action here. For example, Mr N hasnt shown that he was applying for credit during 
this time, or that this delay had had an impact on that. So while I understand that the delay 
will have been frustrating for Mr N, I dont think it would be fair to say here in these 
circumstances that NewDay has to compensate him for that delay.
I understand that this may not have been the response that Mr N as hoping for, but in this 
instance I cant fairly say that NewDay have acted inappropriately, and so I wont be 
upholding this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 January 2021.
