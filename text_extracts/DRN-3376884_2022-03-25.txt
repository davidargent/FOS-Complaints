The complaint
Mrs R complains that AXA PPP Healthcare Limited turned down her private medical 
insurance claim. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator, and for these 
reasons:
The policy excludes fees for any kind of bariatric surgery, regardless of why the 
surgery is needed. 
I understand that Mrs R needs bariatric surgery for medical reasons rather than 
cosmetic reasons. However, AXA has chosen to exclude this type of surgery, 
regardless of why its needed. 
I recognise that Mrs R has been going through a difficult time, and whilst I appreciate 
she wants AXA to apply its discretion and pay the claim, I see no reason to require 
AXA to step outside the terms of the policy here. I therefore find that AXAs decision 
to turn down the claim was fair and in line with its policy terms. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
