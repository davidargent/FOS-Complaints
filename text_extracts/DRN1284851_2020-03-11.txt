Miss Y says Elevate Credit International  Limited  trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 34 loans Sunny provided to Miss Y between June 2016 and July 
2017. Miss Ys borrowing  history is set out on the table in the appendix below.
Miss Y told us that she had a long history  of using payday loans and was unable  to work. 
She says her income  was made up of benefits  and she didnt give an accurate picture  of her 
income and expenditure. Miss Y also says she told Sunny of her financial difficulties, but it 
continued to lend to her.
In its final response,  Sunny didnt uphold  Miss Ys complaint. It said that the checks  carried 
out were proportionate  and sufficient and the information it obtained showed Miss Ys loan 
repayments were sustainable  over the term without placing  Miss Y in undue financial 
difficulty.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ys complaint.  She said Sunny  shouldnt have given Miss Y 
loans 4-34.  Sunny responded  and put forward a different settlement. It said it disagreed  that 
taking out three loans  together  would be a reason to say the loan shouldnt have been given 
provided it was affordable. It did agree  that when reviewing Miss Ys overall pattern of 
borrowing it thought  it should have asked  more questions  at some point as there had been 
no significant breaks in lending,  but it disagreed that it should  not have continued to lend 
from loan 4 onwards.  It thought from loan 13 it may have been  prudent  to have done  things 
differently and it offered £448.20 to settle the matter. It then made a revised offer and offered 
to put things right from loan 4-34 but it did not include 8% interest. Miss Y didnt accept these 
offers and the complaint  was passed to me to make  a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss Y could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN12848512the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss Y could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ys complaint. Ive decided  to uphold loans 4-34. I 
will explain  why.
Our adjudicator couldnt say it was unfair to give Miss Y loans 1-3. This was the early part of 
the lending relationship with her and I think the checks Sunny did at that time would have 
been proportionate and based on what Miss Y told Sunny at that time. I think  on balance  
these loans would have appeared sustainably affordable.
But for loans 4 -7 I think Sunny  should have done more.  Loan 4 was the second  chain  of 
lending. When Miss Y took out loan 4 she still had loan 3 outstanding and borrowed another 
£300 which was double the amount of loan 3. Miss Y borrowed loan 5 only 12 days  after she 
had repaid loan 3 and 4 on the same day and she borrowed £250.00 so did not substantially  
reduce the amount she was borrowing. By loan 6, Miss Y had borrowed her third group of 
borrowing and she still had loan 5 outstanding  and borrowed another £200. Again, at loan 7 
she still had to repay loan 6 when she took out a further £150.00.  Thinking  about all these 
things, I think Sunny should  have probably realised  that Miss Y would struggle to sustainably 
repay loans  4,5,6 and 7 and was having  problems  managing money.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss Y, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ys case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss Y was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss Y had taken out eight  loans within  nearly 5 months and it was 
the fourth group of lending  Sunny had provided  to her. Miss Y had been  indebted  to 
Ref: DRN12848513Sunny for all that time,  during which it was the third time the capital borrowed in the 
group had reached £450.00. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely than 
not Miss Y was having  to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan 
was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ys indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Miss Ys first loan was for £300  and loan 8 was for £100.00. But at this point she still 
had loans 6 and 7 outstanding and the loans in that group of borrowing had 
amounted to £450.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Miss Y was not 
likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in their income  but to meet an ongoing 
need. 
From  loan 8 onwards  Miss Y was provided with a new loan whilst she was still on 
many occasions still repaying previous loans. For example, when she was given loan 
8, Miss Y still had loans 6 and 7 outstanding. When Miss Y took out loan12 she still 
had loans 9,10,11 and 12. 
Miss Y wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 34 was 
taken out just under a year after Miss Ys first loan. And it was for £300  which was 
the largest amount she had borrowed. At that time she still had loan 26 outstanding. 
Miss Y had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I think that Miss Y lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ys indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss Y borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ys ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4-7 and loan 8-34 and Sunny  should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss Y paid on loans 8 -34;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4-7 from Miss Ys credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 8 onwards should be removed from 
Miss Ys credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN12848514my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ys complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 April 2020.
