K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains about issues hes experienced with a car purchased with finance  from 
Startline Motor Finance  Limited.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I didnt  propose to uphold  Mr Ts complaint. I 
invited Mr T and Startline to let me have any further evidence  or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Neither Mr T nor Startline  replied to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither Mr T nor Startline  replied to my provisional  decision. So I see no reason  to reach 
different conclusions to the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in my provisional decision  my final decision is 
that I dont  uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2020.
