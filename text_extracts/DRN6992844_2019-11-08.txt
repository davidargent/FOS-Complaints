Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Os complaint in part and thought that loans 3, 5 to 8 and 11 to 13 
shouldnt have been lent. Uncle Buck didnt fully agree with the adjudication but it offered to 
redress loans 3, 5 to 8 and 12 in line with the adjudicators recommendation. Ms O didnt 
accept the offer and the complaint was passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN69928442the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Ms O could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Os complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that loans 1  2, 4 and 9  10 should  be upheld.  And having  
looked at the circumstances  around  these loans, I agree with this. Ms O hasnt disagreed  
with this finding and Ive concluded that these  loans are no longer  in dispute. So Ive 
focussed my decision on the loans still in dispute, loans 11 and 13.
Ms O has provided copies of her bank statements at the time of the loans and I think the 
information on these  statements  suggest that had Uncle Buck carried out proportionate 
checks before lending loan 11, its likely  to have found that Ms O couldnt afford the loan.  
Proportionate checks for loan 11 wouldve involved Uncle Buck  looking to build a clear 
picture of Ms Os finances  including verifying  some  of the information she provided.
I think Uncle Buck would likely have seen that Ms O was borrowing from at least three other 
short term lenders  and she had over £1,000  outstanding in short term loans. Ms Os income  
was around £1,775, this was made up of her income  and child benefit payments. Ms Os 
living costs  were over £1,000. So Ms O couldnt afford  the loan repayment.
Proportionate checks for loan 13 would be similar to loan 11 and had Uncle  Buck built a 
clearer picture of Ms Os finances  including verifying some of the information  she provided, 
its likely  to have found that she continued  to borrow from other  short term lenders and had 
around £400 outstanding  when she was lent loan 13. Ms Os income had reduced to around 
£1,454 and her living  costs were including regular credit commitments were around  £1,186.
So I dont  think Uncle Buck should  have  lent loan 13 to Ms O as she couldnt afford the loan 
repayment.
Uncle Buck  needs  to put things right on loans 11 and 13 as well as the other  loans it agrees 
it shouldnt have lent to Ms O.
Ref: DRN69928443putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms O paid on loans 3, 5 to 8 and 11 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3, 5 to 8 and 11 to 13 from Ms Os 
credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Ms O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if s asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Os complaint. Uncle Buck  Finance 
LLP should pay Ms O compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 December 2019.
