K820x#14Complaint
Mrs L has complained  about  an unsecured personal  loan Madison CF UK Limited  (trading as 
118 118 Money) provided to her. She says if 118 118 Money had looked  at her credit  
report it would have  seen  that she had been  in a cycle of continuous high interest  payday  
loans and other credit for many years  and so couldnt afford this loan.
Background
Mrs L was provided with a loan of £2,650.00  by 118 118 Money in August 2017. The loan 
was due to be repaid  in 24 instalments of around £205. As understand an outstanding 
balance remains due to be paid on it.  
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Mrs L and 118 118 Money had told us. And he 
thought that 118 118 Money hadnt lent irresponsibly.  So he didnt uphold Mrs Ls complaint. 
Mrs L disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at her complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained  how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible  lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mrs Ls complaint.
118 118 Money needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what  this 
means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mrs L could afford to repay this loan before providing it to her. 
Our website  sets out what we typically think about  when deciding  whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what  it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high.  And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater  the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt  continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money says it agreed to Mrs Ls application after she provided  details  of her 
monthly income and expenditure.  It says it cross-checked this against  information on a credit 
search it carried out on Mrs L. In its opinion,  the information Mrs L provided about  her 
income and expenditure showed shed be able to comfortably make  the repayments  she was 
being asked to commit to. On the other hand, Mrs L says she was in financial difficulty and 
shouldnt have been lent to.
Ive carefully thought  about what Mrs L and 118 118 Money have said. The first and most  
crucial thing for me to say here is that this was Mrs Ls first loan with 118 118 Money. The 
information provided does suggest  Mrs L was asked to provide details of her income and 
expenditure and 118 118 Money didnt  just rely on what it was told. 
Ref: DRN11871622The credit search 118 118 Money carried out did show  a history of payday  loans but it looks 
as though Mrs L said shed be using the proceeds from this loan to consolidate her existing  
debts. Mrs Ls lack of any previous lending with 118 118 Money  leads me to think it wasnt  
unreasonable for 118 118 Money to rely on this. Indeed Mrs L appears to have paid off a 
number of loans  and as the repayments,  on the face of things, appeared affordable  I dont 
think 118 118 had reason  to be concerned at this stage.
I know why Mrs L found  it difficult to pay this loan. And I accept that these reasons may well 
have been more apparent  if 118 118 Money  had requested bank statements like Mrs L says.  
Its also possible 118 118 Money might have made  a different decision had it seen this 
information. But 118 118 Money  could  only make its decision based on the information it had 
available at the time. And, at this stage of its lending relationship  with Mrs L, I dont think 
proportionate checks wouldve  extended  into 118 118 Money asking Mrs L to provide her 
bank statements.
Equally its only fair and reasonable  for me to uphold a complaint in circumstances a lender
did something wrong. And, in this case,  I dont think that 118 118 Money  did anything wrong 
in deciding to lend to Mrs L - it carried out proportionate checks  even though its looks  like the 
information it was provided with didnt tell the whole  story. 118 118 Money reasonably  relied 
on this information  and given the amount  of the repayments involved and its lack of history 
with Mrs L, I dont think it was unreasonable for 118 118 Money  to provide this loan.
So overall I dont  think that 118 118 Money unfairly  provided Mrs L with this loan.  As this is 
the case, Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be very disappointing for    
Mrs L. But I hope shell understand  the reasons for my decision and that shell  at least feel 
her concerns  have  been listened to.
Although Im not upholding Mrs Ls complaint, I would remind 118 118 Money of its 
obligation to exercise forbearance in light of Mrs Ls apparent difficulty  repaying this loan, 
should it choose to collect payments from her.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding Mrs Ls complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2021.
