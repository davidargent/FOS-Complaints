K822xComplaint
Mr J is unhappy with the service hes received from NewDay Ltd (NewDay). He feels 
NewDay hasnt been helpful in getting  a deposit back from a car dealer, has been rude to 
him on the telephone and has blocked  a payment on his card unnecessarily.
Background 
Mr J has an Aqua credit card provided  by NewDay. In June 2018 Mr J used his credit card to 
make a payment  of £100 to a car dealer. Hes explained he paid this sum as a deposit to 
ensure a car was held for him until he was able to view it. When  Mr J viewed the car he was 
unhappy with its condition and decided not to buy it. He says the car dealer hasnt returned 
the £100 he paid and is unhappy because he feels NewDay didnt help him to recover it.
Mr J also says NewDay was rude to him during  telephone calls and blocked a transaction  on 
his account, causing him inconvenience.
NewDay has explained it considered a chargeback claim. But decided  not to go ahead  with it 
because Mr J hasnt provided any evidence the deposit was refundable. So NewDay  says 
the claim wouldnt be successful. It confirmed if Mr J could provide evidence the deposit 
shouldve been  refunded  by the car dealer, it would dispute the transaction on his behalf. It 
also said there was no evidence it blocked  Mr Js card after the June  2018  transaction,  or 
that its staff had been rude. 
Our investigator investigated the complaint. He asked for call recordings to consider whether 
NewDays staff members  were rude to Mr J. NewDay wasnt  able to provide recordings of all 
of its calls but agreed to pay £100  to Mr J to reflect any poor service, which the investigator  
thought was reasonable. He felt NewDay  acted reasonably in not attempting  to raise a 
chargeback claim against the merchant selling the car. The investigator referred to a blocked  
card in February 2019 and concluded  NewDay hadnt done anything  wrong.
Mr J didnt agree with the investigator and asked  for his complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman. He said NewDay should be made  to provide all of its calls,  his card was 
blocked in June/July 2018 without any contact with him and that he should be refunded the 
£100 deposit.
I issued my provisional decision on 27 November 2019. I separated the complaint  issues 
and my findings related to each issue.
Chargeback claim
I said there was some  confusion about  the basis on which Mr J wanted  his deposit refunded.
He referred to section  75 (s.75) of the Consumer  Credit  Act 1974. The investigator said this 
didnt apply because  Mr J didnt buy the car. I reviewed the available evidence  and agreed  
that s.75 still didnt apply  in this case. It only applied to payments which were over £100.  For 
any clams to be considered under  s.75, the amount  claimed would  need  to be over £100 
and no more than £30,000. In this case therefore, NewDay  wasnt  able to apply s.75 as the 
deposit payment  was exactly £100  and not over £100.
I could see NewDay did consider whether to use the chargeback system. When  a bank looks 
at whether to raise  a chargeback for a customer,  it first has to satisfy itself the payment 
being challenged is eligible for chargeback. To do this it has to look at the relevant rules that 
apply  in this case - Mastercard regulations. The card issuer  NewDay  checks  the nature 
of the dispute  against  a list of possible chargeback reasons to see what  evidence  is 
Ref: DRN84295582required, the timescales, and whether the claim could be successful. NewDay  asks the 
cardholder  Mr J  for any relevant information.
Depending on the reason  for the dispute,  NewDay then has to use a chargeback  reason 
code. Chargeback can be used when a business was meant to give a refund to a customer, 
but didnt. NewDay  would  have to use the relevant code  for this as the chargeback reason.
But NewDay  doesnt have  to raise a chargeback if it thinks theres no reasonable chance of 
success. In Mr Js case, I was satisfied  NewDay acted reasonably in asking for evidence  
from Mr J to see if it could  make  a successful claim. This is because  Mr Js chargeback was 
only likely to be successful if he could provide evidence his deposit was a returnable one. If 
the deposit was made  on a non-refundable  basis chargeback wouldnt be successful. Mr J 
hadnt provided this evidence,  so I thought  NewDay  had acted reasonably  in not raising a 
chargeback.
Service provided
The investigator asked  for all the call recordings during the period of Mr Js complaint.
However, NewDay hadnt been able to find all of the calls. Weve  listened to one of the calls 
but this wasnt  a complete call. This was Mr Js call to NewDay  on 13 July 2018 which 
provided a recording  up to the point  he was transferred. From what  I heard, I didnt think the 
member of staff he spoke to was rude.  I agreed with Mr J though this wasnt ideal.  But 
NewDay had accepted that as it couldnt  demonstrate staff members  were polite it would 
compensate Mr J, which I thought was fair.
Blocked card
Mr J said a payment for around £3 was blocked by NewDay in June/July  2018 and this 
caused him inconvenience. Mr J provided  a copy of his phone  bill to show  calls were made 
to NewDay in June  and July 2018.  As the calls were made over a year ago NewDay no 
longer had recordings of them. It provided system  notes of the calls Mr J had highlighted 
though. From those  notes  I saw Mr J called NewDay on 26 June 2018 and discussed a 
cancelled direct debit.  His next call, on 28 June  related to his problems with NewDay,  as did 
a call on 13 July. Having  looked at those, there was nothing that suggested  Mr Js card was 
blocked during  this period. A block was however placed on the account  in February 2019, 
but I understood Mr J accepted this and wasnt complaining about  it. Given that I couldnt 
see NewDay placed a block on Mr Js account  around June/July 2018, it followed that I 
wasnt persuaded it had done  anything wrong.
In my provisional decision,  I said I was minded to say that I was satisfied NewDay acted 
reasonably in not raising a chargeback and in awarding Mr J £100 in respect of the service it 
provided. I hadnt seen  any evidence which suggested NewDay  blocked Mr Js card apart 
from February 2019. So overall, I was minded to agree with the investigator that £100 
compensation NewDay offered was fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. I didnt think NewDay needed to do anything more.
Mr J has responded. He didnt accept my provisional  decision.  In summary he said:
NewDay should have  told him right from the beginning  it wouldnt raise  a chargeback 
and then he would have complained directly to the dealer without waiting for 40 days;
NewDay has chosen which calls to provide to this service;
If I couldnt make NewDay provide all its call recordings, he shouldnt  have to prove 
his deposit was refundable;
NewDay only offered  compensation after he brought  his complaint to this service 
because it knows how we work; 
Ref: DRN84295583His card was blocked while he was in France.  It worked at motorway tolls, but not in 
shops. 
New Day hasnt responded to my provisional decision. 
My findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I still think the offer of 
£100 is fair and reasonable  and I wont be asking NewDay to do anything more. Ill explain 
further below.
Chargeback claim
I still think NewDay acted reasonably in not raising  a chargeback  claim,  as there is no 
evidence the deposit was refundable. Without  this evidence a chargeback  claim would 
unlikely be successful. Mr J said NewDay should  have told him to approach the dealer 
directly from the beginning. Having looked  at NewDays call notes made at the time, Im 
satisfied NewDay did advise Mr J to approach the dealer directly.  NewDay also told Mr J 
what evidence it would  need to make a chargeback  claim. So I cant  see that Mr J has been  
misinformed. 
Mr J says he shouldnt be asked to provide  evidence  that the deposit was refundable when 
NewDay hasnt provided a recording of all its calls with him. Both parties are required to 
provide evidence relating to the complaint  issues and which we require as part of our 
investigation. NewDay has said the call recordings  werent available  as they were older, and 
I have no reason to doubt this. I also dont consider NewDays  failure to provide a call 
recording has any bearing on the evidence Mr J needs to provide for NewDay to make  a 
chargeback claim. They are separate issues. Mr J has been asked to provide evidence  the 
deposit was paid on the basis  it was refundable because without this evidence  a chargeback 
claim is unlikely to be successful. 
Service provided
In my provisional decision I said it was regrettable that NewDay was unable  to provide the 
recording of the call in which  Mr J says it was rude.  But it still reviewed the circumstances 
and while  the calls werent all available, it decided to offer £100 to reflect  any possible poor 
service he says he received. So I think this offer is fair based on the evidence  available.
Blocked card
In my provisional decision I said there was no evidence NewDay  had blocked  Mr Js card. I 
said this after looking at Mr Js phone bill and NewDays  call records.  On the days Mr J 
provided evidence  he called NewDay, none of the calls related to a blocked payment. Mr J 
said in his response his card worked at motorway tolls but not in shops. Im uncertain why 
this happened. I have  nevertheless seen no evidence NewDay blocked Mr Js card.   
Mr J has mentioned court action. This is a matter for him to consider if he wishes  but is not 
something I need to comment  on in this decision. 
Conclusion
Having considered all the additional points raised Ive reached the same decision  I set out in 
my provisional decision. Whilst  Im sympathetic to the position  Mr J finds himself in, I 
consider NewDay  acted reasonably in not making a chargeback claim without evidence the 
deposit was refundable. I consider NewDays offer to pay Mr J £100  is fair in the 
Ref: DRN84295584circumstances of this complaint. Ive also not seen  any evidence to suggest Mr Js card was 
blocked. NewDay doesnt need  to do anything further. 
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, the offer of £100 to settle Mr Js complaint against NewDay Ltd 
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances..
NewDay Ltd has offered  to pay Mr J £100  as Ive outlined above. I conclude that such  an 
offer is fair compensation in the circumstances.  My decision is that NewDay  Ltd should pay 
any outstanding  amount  within 28 days of receiving notice of Mr Js acceptance of this 
decision. Mr J should note that if he accepts  my decision, it will be legally  binding  on all 
parties and he probably then wouldnt  be able to take legal action over this matter  for 
additional compensation. If, however,  he rejects  the decision, although  his legal rights will 
remain intact, itll be purely a matter  between him and NewDay Ltd as to whether the above 
offer still remains open for acceptance.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 January 2020.
