K820x#14complaint
Mr D has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted irresponsibly by 
increasing his overdraft without doing  sufficient checks on his finances.
background
Mr D has a current account  with NatWest. 
Mr D says NatWest  allowed him to increase his overdraft from £250  to £4,000 in under a 
month. He subsequently  complained to NatWest saying that it hadnt done  sufficient checks  
to ensure he was able to afford  the overdraft. He said that NatWest would have seen he had 
a poor credit  rating,  had multiple  existing loans and credit cards and was using his overdraft  
for gambling  had it done so. He asked  NatWest to refund charges and interest. 
NatWest investigated  Mr Ds complaint and said hed passed their affordability checks based  
on the information he provided.  NatWest  said it wouldnt refund the interest and charges 
because it hadnt  made an error and had applied them in line with terms of the overdraft. 
Mr D remained  dissatisfied and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that 
NatWests checks were  sufficient to show the overdraft  would have been  affordable  to Mr D 
at the time. Mr D didnt  agree and asked  me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before businesses agree  to lend they must carry out checks  to make sure that the lending  is 
affordable and responsible. There arent  set checks that a lender has to carry out  the 
checks done do, however, have to be proportionate.
Mr D applied four times over a three week period  to increase his overdraft.  He applied online 
and this involved giving details of his income  and expenditure, including  his net income, his 
mortgage payments,  living costs,  and loan and card repayments. Ive seen the information  
Mr D gave about his income and expenditure for each application. Ive also seen additional 
checks that NatWest did to make sure there  were  no inconsistencies  between  the 
information Mr D had given and information on his credit file. Those additional checks  
showed that there were no inconsistencies.  It wasnt, therefore, unreasonable of NatWest to 
rely on the information Mr D had given and to come  to the conclusion that the overdrafts he 
was applying for were  affordable.
Ive also considered that Mr D made four applications over a short  period of time, and 
whether this would  have  prompted NatWest to do more checks. Mr D made four 
applications, which increased his overdraft by £1,000 each time. Following Mr Ds initial 
application for £1,000, NatWest authorised an overdraft of up to £4,170 based on Mr Ds 
disposable income. As the information  Mr D provided during each application  was consistent 
and was verified by NatWests credit file checks, NatWest  authorised  up to £4,170 at each 
application. So I think it was reasonable for NatWest  to have accepted the four applications 
over a short period  of time as each application was within the authorised  lending  limit.  
Ref: DRN31487812Mr D said that NatWest  should have known that he was using his overdraft for gambling. 
Mr D thinks NatWest should have  checked his bank  statements at each  application and this 
would have shown  his gambling  transactions. However, I dont think  NatWest had reason to 
scrutinise his bank statements considering it verified  Mr Ds income and expenditure and this 
left Mr D with a sufficient disposable  income to make the lending affordable. I think  the 
checks NatWest did at each application  were proportionate to the amount of lending  and 
dont think NatWest would have reasonably been  aware that Mr D was using his overdraft for 
gambling. 
Mr D made  several more applications for credit  with NatWest later in the year,  including 
applications for loans and a higher overdraft amount. NatWest  declined most of the 
applications following  affordability checks. Im satisfied  NatWests checking process has 
value as NatWest  deemed some  of Mr Ds credit application unaffordable  for him. I can also 
see from Mr Ds credit file, he also took out more  credit with other providers later in the year. 
Overall, NatWest did sufficient checks in this case to assess  if the £4,000 overdraft was 
affordable for Mr D. For this reason,  I wont be asking NatWest to refund  any interest or 
charges associated with the overdraft.
my final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding this complaint
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 August 2019.
