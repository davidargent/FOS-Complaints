The complaint
Miss P has complained that MotoNovo Finance Limited mis-sold her a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy when she took out finance to buy a car.
What happened
Miss P contacted MotoNovo in May 2022 to say that she had been off sick for three weeks, 
at which time it referred her to the insurer to make a claim on the PPI.
Miss Ps claim was subsequently declined. As a result of this, she thinks that the policy was 
mis-sold to her by MotoNovo. She says it told her shed be able to make a claim after 30 
days but the insurer told her that she couldnt claim for the first six months.
Our adjudicator partly upheld the complaint. He didnt think that the policy had been mis-sold 
because MotoNovo had acted reasonably in trying to ensure that the policy was suitable for 
Miss P. However, as it seems that Miss P was likely ineligible for the policy, he thought that 
MotoNovo should refund the premiums that Miss P had paid. MotoNovo agreed to this and 
offered to refund Â£77.91.
Miss P disagrees with our adjudicators opinion and so the complaint has been passed to me 
for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There appears to be some confusion about the six-month period. The policy has a 30 day 
waiting period, not six months. But the insurer didnt decline Miss Ps claim because she 
tried to make it within six months. They declined it because Miss P had not been paying 
National Insurance (NI) contributions in the six months prior to taking out the policy.
If Miss P thinks that the insurer made a mistake in turning down her claim, then she would 
need to complain to them separately. In this decision I am just looking at whether MotoNovo 
mis-sold the policy.
This was an advised sale. This means that, in recommending the PPI to her, MotoNovo 
needed to ensure that it met Miss Ps needs. To do this they went through a demands and 
needs questionnaire with her. One of the questions was:
Are you aged between 18 and 65 years and have you been in continuous employment for 
the last 6 months and do you pay National Insurance Contributions?
Miss P answered Yes to this. So on that basis, MotoNovo had no reason to suspect that the 
policy wasnt entirely suitable for her.
Ive also seen evidence that MotoNovo correctly informed Miss P that she couldnt make a 
claim within the first 30 days, in line with the policy terms and conditions.
Our adjudicators view was that Miss Ps answer to the above question had indicated that 
she was eligible for the PPI but in reality her situation meant that she was ineligible and so 
would never have been able to make a successful claim. As such, he thought it would be fair 
for MotoNovo to refund the premiums she had paid. As MotoNovo consented to this, I agree 
that this would be a fair way to resolve Miss Ps complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my decision is that MotoNovo Finance Limited did not mis-
sell the PPI policy. But MotoNovo Finance Limited should now carry out its offer to refund 
Miss Ps premiums.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 September 2023.
