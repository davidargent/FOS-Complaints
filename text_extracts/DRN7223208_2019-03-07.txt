K820x#14complaint
Miss W complains that Bank of Scotland plc, trading as Halifax, didnt send her full 
statements showing her account  balance. She also complains that they sent her statements 
showing an average balance on her account  and she didnt want these. 
background
Miss W holds an account with Halifax. On 14 November 2017, £17,000 was paid into her 
account which brought her account balance  to £17,600.
Miss W wrote to Halifax  on 2 June 2018  to say shed received a statement, dated 23 March 
2018, saying the average  balance on the account was £6,701.36.  Miss W asked for bank 
statements to confirm  the account had a balance of £17,600. She complained that the 
balance shown shouldve  been the actual balance rather  than the average balance.  
Halifax responded to Miss W by letter dated  9 June  2018. They didnt  think they had made  
any errors. They explained a credit of £17,000 was paid into the account  on 14 November 
2017. They  also said that, as there hadnt been any activity on the account  since  the last 
statement of 12 December 2017, no further  statements  were  generated. They  wondered if 
Miss W was looking at an old statement  dated  24 March 2017  which  showed  a balance of 
£600. 
Miss W was not satisfied with Halifaxs response  so brought  her complaint to this service.
Our investigator considered the complaint.  She found that she couldnt ask Halifax to change 
their procedures on what statements they sent to her as this was a matter  for the Financial 
Conduct Authority.  
She didnt  think that Halifax  had done  anything wrong. She looked  at the statements and 
found they were  correct.  They  showed  a balance of £17,600. But, because the last 
statement was in December 2017, she also provided screen shot of Miss Ws account,  dated 
8 January 2019, showing a balance of £17,600.  
Miss W wasnt happy with this outcome as she wanted statements showing her full balance. 
She didnt  want statements showing an average balance. 
The complaint has now come to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid Miss W wont be happy with my decision.  I dont think  that there is anything further 
that I can ask Halifax  to do. I will explain why. 
It seems  to me that Miss W is now clear that she does have a balance  of £17,600 in her 
account. This has been shown in the screen shot sent to her by our investigator and also in 
the, albeit old, statement  dated 12 December 2017. 
Ref: DRN72232082Miss Ws complaint, I think, focusses on confusing statements showing average balances.  
She doesnt want these  and would prefer an up to date statement showing the actual 
balance. I can see why these would be more useful to Miss W. 
But, as explained  by our investigator, this service cant tell Halifax  how to run its business. 
This would include  what type of statements  they send and how regularly they send them. So, 
there is nothing that I can ask Halifax to do. 
If it does  help, if no further transactions are made on the account, the next yearly  statement 
that Miss W gets will show a balance of £17,600. And the average balance shown will also 
be £17,600. 
my final decision
Because I cant tell Bank of Scotland plc how to send their statements and what to put on 
them, I wont be asking them to do anything. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 April 2019.
