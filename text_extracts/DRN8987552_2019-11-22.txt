Two adjudicators looked at this complaint. Our most recent adjudication upheld the 
complaint in full and thought Morses  club shouldnt have  given  Mrs O any of the loans. 
Morses Club didnt  respond to the most  recent adjudication and the complaint was passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  irresponsible lending  - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.  
Morses Club needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN89875522the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Morses Club was required to establish whether Mrs O could sustainably repay her loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Morses Club took over responsibility for another business in March  2014. When  the loans 
were transferred to Morses Club, loan 1 was already active  and Mrs O had three other loans 
outstanding with the other business. Also,  Mrs O had repaid two other  loans on the day 
loans 1 and 2 were  funded. 
Given Mrs Os lending history which Morses Club was likely aware of, Ive looked  at the 
overall pattern  of Morses Clubs lending history with Mrs O, with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Morses Club should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses Club should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Os case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 1 I say this because: 
I think its likely Morses Club wouldve been aware that Mrs O had three outstanding  
loans with the other business and so it ought  to have realised she was not managing 
to repay  her loans  sustainably and that she wasnt borrowing to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in her finances.
From  loan 1 onwards  Mrs O was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. Several  of her loans overlapped and I cant see that she had any 
breaks in borrowing  from Morses Club. 
Mrs O became reliant on these loans  and she wasnt making  any real inroads to the 
amount she owed Morses Club. Loan  16 was taken out 18 months  after Mrs Os first, 
but shed been  borrowing consistently for longer than that. Mrs O had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Morses  Club over an extended 
period.
Ref: DRN89875523These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Os indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time and I think  
she lost out as a result.
So Im also upholding  Mrs Os complaint about Morses Club in full and it should  put things 
right.
putting things right  what Morses  Club needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs O paid on all her loans;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses Club to take off tax from this interest. Morses 
Club must give Mrs Os estate a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if it asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  this complaint. Morses  Club Plc should  pay 
Mrs Os estate compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O on behalf of 
Mrs Os estate to accept  or reject  my decision before 22 December 2019.
