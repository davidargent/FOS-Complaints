The complaint
Mrs W complains about the service provided by Clydesdale Bank Plc trading as Virgin 
Money when opening an ISA and a fixed rate bond.
What happened
In 2022 Mrs W held an account with Virgin Money that matured  the proceeds of which 
were paid into her chosen bank account. In June 2022 she decided to reinvest with Virgin 
Money, and paid £20,000 into a cash ISA with an interest rate of 2.2%, and £65,000 into a 
bond with an interest rate of 2.45%. After sending confirmation of the investments, Virgin 
Money asked Mrs W to provide identity documents. Mrs W questioned the need for these, as 
she was a pre-existing customer. She was worried about the potential for her documents 
falling into someone elses hands in transit, so wanted to avoid sending them if possible. 
Virgin Money replied and confirmed the identity documents would be required. Mrs W called 
and was told this would be looked into further  however she was promised several call 
backs which didnt materialise. In October, Virgin Money returned the amount invested to her 
bank account. In November they sent a final response to Mrs Ws complaint, offering £50 
compensation and 8% interest (minus tax) on the £20,000 from the ISA, for the period of 18 
October to 31 October 2022. However, they didnt explain why theyd chosen that date 
range.
Mrs W remained unhappy and so brought the complaint to our service. She wanted interest 
on the £85,000 invested for the whole period  not simply the dates Virgin Money had 
chosen. She eventually re-invested in November 2022 elsewhere at a higher interest rate. 
An investigator at our service found that Virgin Money should pay Mrs W a total of £100 in 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. She also found that the original 
interest rates applicable to the ISA and bond ought to be paid to Mrs W for the whole time 
Virgin Money had held the £85,000. Mrs W didnt agree, as she felt interest was owed up 
until the dates she was able to reinvest the money from the ISA and bond  3 November and 
30 November 2022 respectively. She also felt tax shouldnt be deducted from the 8% interest 
offered. So, the complaint was passed to me for a decision.
I got in touch with the parties and explained I was satisfied a payment of £200 would more 
fairly reflect the distress and inconvenience caused. Virgin Money agreed to pay that 
amount. I also set out that some interest had already been paid, and that some ought to be 
payable, as follows:
On the ISA  Mrs W received £152.18 (on top of the £20,000 invested) on 18 
October 2022. This appeared to be interest at the rate of 2.2% from June to 17 
October 2022.
On the bond  Mrs W received £550.88 (on top of the £65,000 invested) on 17 
October 2022. This appeared to be interest at the rate of 2.45% from June to 17 
October 2022. 
Virgin Money had offered interest just on the ISA for the period of 18 October 2023 to 
31 October 2023 at the rate of 8%. I explained to Mrs W that Virgin Money were 
required to deduct tax at 20% from this and so it is fair that they do this. 
I asked Virgin Money to pay 8% interest on the bond for the same date range and 
Virgin Money has agreed to do this. 
Mrs W explained she feels interest ought to be payable up to 30 November 2022 on the 
bond amount, as it took her some time to find a provider she was happy with. As the interest 
was due to the firms error, she maintained that she didnt think tax should be deducted  or 
that shed prefer to declare and pay the tax herself via her tax declaration. She also felt the 
£200 was inadequate for Virgin Moneys conduct and the inconvenience caused. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs Ws complaint goes back to the requirement for identity documents  in general the 
requirement for these documents is something I consider to be at a firms discretion. 
However, the way they communicate with their customers about this needs to be clear, fair 
and not misleading. Both parties agree that Virgin Money ought to have been better at 
communicating with Mrs W  both in terms of the clarity and the timeliness of the 
communication  and for completeness I agree.
Ive considered the financial loss caused by Virgin Moneys actions. Im pleased to see that 
when they returned the capital, this did include the interest at the initial rates of 2.2% and 
2.45% and this has been paid up until the money was returned to Mrs W. From 18 October 
2022 to 31 October 2022 Virgin Money has offered to pay 8% simple interest, as during this 
time Mrs W was still being given inconsistent information and so was unable to use the 
money as she wished. 
Virgin Money has provided the calculations of the 8% interest payments and explained that 
these were not calculated on the actual amount Mrs W received on 17 October 2022 but on 
a slightly lower amount. That amount is before the final interest or 2.2% or 2.45% was added 
to the product itself. Having reviewed this issue, Im satisfied they havent calculated this 
correctly. Virgin Money ought to be using the actual amount Mrs W received in the 
calculations for the interest payment, as follows:
On the ISA, Virgin Money have used an amount of £20,063.89 but this should be 
£20,152.18 as this is the actual amount Mrs W was deprived of using. 
On the bond, Virgin Money have used an amount of £65,235.61 but this should be 
£65,550.88, as again, this is the actual amount Mrs W was deprived of using.
Ive carefully considered Mrs Ws comments about interest payable from 31 October 2022 to 
the date she was able to reinvest. I dont think it would be fair to award interest for that time 
period, primarily because the 8% rate is awarded in situations where someone has been 
deprived of using the amount in question. After October 2022 Mrs W was in a more informed 
position and could use the money for whatever she wanted. Ive also taken into 
consideration that because of these problems with Virgin Money, the interest rate she 
received on her money was higher following reinvestment in November 2022 than it 
otherwise would have been had the problems not occurred. 
Turning to the deduction of 20% from the award of 8% interest - though I do appreciate Mrs 
Ws preference to declare her own tax and deal with it in that way, Im conscious that this 
deduction is an industry standard practice. Im satisfied its reasonable for Virgin Money to deduct it here. Id expect Virgin Money to supply Mrs W with a tax deduction certificate which 
Mrs W can then use for her own records. 
Ive also carefully considered the impact of the errors on Mrs W. Due to Virgin Money not 
being clear and consistent with their answers to Mrs Ws questions, she was caused 
inconvenience in having to repeatedly ask similar questions to Virgin Money. She was 
naturally confused by the lack of consistency in the answers. Im satisfied that £200 fairly 
reflects the level of service she received over the summer of 2022.   
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Clydesdale Bank Plc trading as Virgin Money should pay Mrs W:
£200 for the distress and inconvenience caused
Simple interest at the rate of 8% on £20,152.18 and £65,550.88 from 18 October 
2022 to 31 October 2022.
If Virgin Money considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Mrs W how much its taken off. It should also give Mrs W a 
tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2023.
