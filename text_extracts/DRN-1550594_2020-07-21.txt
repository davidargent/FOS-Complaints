The complaint
Mr M complains that Retail Money Market Ltd (trading as Rate Setter) recorded a missed 
payment on his credit file. Mr M says the payment was late, not missed. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr Ms payment was due on 30 December 2019 but wasnt received by Rate Setter 
until 10 January 2020. Mr M complained as he found Rate Setter registered a missed 
payment on his credit file for December 2019. But the following month, Rate Setter 
reported that Mr Ms account had been brought up to date and wasnt in arrears. 
Ive seen the information reported by Rate Setter to the credit reference agencies 
and Im satisfied it accurately reflects what happened. The payment profile shows Mr 
Ms December 2019 payment wasnt made on time so Rate Setter reported it as 
missed. The payment profile reported by Rate Setter shows that in January 2020 Mr 
M made up the late payment and also made his contractual monthly payment. The 
payment profile showed that Mr Ms account was not in arrears in January 2020.
Our investigator recently asked Mr M for further information to explain why he feels 
the information reported by Rate Setter was wrong but he hasnt responded. 
As I havent found that Rate Setter reported the wrong information and Im satisfied 
its dealt with Mr Ms complaint fairly Im not telling it to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 August 2020.
