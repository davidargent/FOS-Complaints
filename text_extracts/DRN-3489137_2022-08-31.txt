The complaint
Miss T has complained PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA wont refund her £200 for fake 
goods she bought.
What happened
In 2021 Miss T bought designer trainers using her PayPal account. These cost £200 and the 
seller encouraged her to use the friend and family payment option to avoid seller costs.
When the trainers arrived Miss T realised they were fake and tried to get her money back. 
Her bank couldnt complete a chargeback refund and PayPal confirmed they were unable to 
help. Their User Agreement confirmed they wouldnt do anything further once a customer 
had pursued a refund through their card issuer.
Miss T wanted our service to continue to consider this. Our investigator confirmed PayPal 
were right. In addition PayPals User Agreement also meant that if a customer had used the 
friend and family option to make a payment, these were not eligible for protection.
Miss T has asked an ombudsman to consider her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
The facts of this case arent really in dispute. Miss T bought a pair of trainers for £200 using 
PayPals friend and family payment function. These turned out to be fake. 
I completely appreciate she was persuaded to use this option to avoid additional seller costs. 
If shed known this also meant she would have no buyer protection under PayPals User 
Agreement, she may well have made another payment decision. However she did decide to 
use this payment option. This means her payment does not qualify for PayPals buyer 
protection.
It would be unfair of me to ask PayPal to refund Miss T. I appreciate Miss T wont 
necessarily see it this way. Im sorry about that.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Miss Ts complaint against 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2022.
