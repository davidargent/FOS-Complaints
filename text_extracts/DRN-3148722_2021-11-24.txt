The complaint
R, a limited company complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) unfairly 
limited its account and withheld its money. R says this led to cash flow problems and a loss 
in competitiveness.
R wants PayPal to allow it to use its payment platform. R is represented in this complaint by 
a director, Mr C.
What happened
R operates a business supplying goods to customers. In late March 2021, PayPal placed a 
permanent limitation on Rs account. This means that R will not be allowed to use the 
account again.
PayPal says it took this decision as a result of high-risk activity on the account. As R 
receives payments on a pre-order basis, PayPal held on to the money in the account for 180 
days following the date of the last payment.
Mr C was unhappy with PayPals decision and appealed. He explained why R couldnt give 
PayPal evidence that it had fulfilled two orders that it asked about. Mr C said that Rs goods 
are only ready at certain times of the year. Customers pre-order the goods which are then 
sent out when ready. Mr C told PayPal that R makes this clear to its customers on its 
website and in any order confirmation emails. 
Mr C said that R had sent out hundreds of orders and would always refund customers if they 
werent happy to wait for the goods.
The investigator didnt uphold Rs complaint. He was satisfied that PayPal acted within the 
terms of Rs account.
Mr C is very unhappy with the investigators recommendation. He points out that the 
chargebacks PayPal received represented a tiny proportion of successful deliveries made by 
R. And that PayPal has unfairly refused to take account of this evidence.
Mr C says that PayPal continues to offer facilities to Rs competitors despite them performing 
less well. Mr C says that this puts Rs business at a significant disadvantage.
Mr C says PayPal made it difficult to deal with any complaints by restricting access to the 
customers concerned.  Mr C says theres no financial risk to PayPal from chargebacks as 
they are deducted from the balance of funds it holds. 
Mr C thinks that PayPal is abusing its position of power and that this service should do 
something about this. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should explain that this service doesnt supervise, regulate or discipline the businesses that 
we cover. My role is not to punish or penalise businesses for the way in which they conduct 
their business  thats the role of the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority.
But we can consider whether PayPal followed its procedures in the actions it has taken 
against R and if it applied these fairly.
By now, R shouldve received its funds from PayPal. So, Im looking at whether PayPal 
made a mistake when it applied the permanent limitation to its accounts or if it shouldve 
released the money in its account earlier than the 180 days.
Account limitation
Ive looked at the PayPal user agreement that R will have agreed to when it opened its 
account. The user agreement sets out a list of restricted activities which give PayPal the 
right to close or restrict a users account. These can include causing PayPal to receive a 
disproportionate number of claims that have been closed in favour of the claimant regarding 
your PayPal account or business. 
The user agreement also says that it can limit a users account for several reasons, including 
if:
Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk. Examples 
include: indications of poor selling performance because youve received an 
unusually high number of claims and chargebacks
When PayPal contacted R in early March 2021, it asked for further information about some 
orders. This seems reasonable given PayPals concerns about some of the transactions. I 
understand that although R replied immediately it couldnt give PayPal all that it needed due 
to the goods not yet being dispatched. I appreciate that R tried to explain why this was the 
case. But I cant say that PayPal acted unreasonably when, without the requested further 
evidence, and with chargebacks decided in buyers favour, it decided to limit Rs account 
later in the month.
In less than a month, PayPal received 13 claims from customers of R saying that they hadnt 
received the goods theyd paid for. I appreciate what Mr C says about Rs business model 
and its thousands of satisfied customers, but this doesnt mean that I must find PayPal was 
wrong to take the action it did. Or that I can require it to reinstate Rs account. 
I need to consider this complaint as it relates to R. The fact that other similar businesses with 
higher levels of chargebacks continue to benefit from PayPals services, doesnt mean that I 
must find PayPal has treated R unfairly. 
Retention of funds
PayPals User agreement sets out the action it may take if the user engages in any restricted 
activities. This includes allowing PayPal to hold the users money to the extent and for so 
long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability. You acknowledge that, as a 
non-exhaustive guide:
PayPals risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last 
until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by 
card scheme rules) has passed. This depends on certain factors, including without limitation:
a) The type of goods or services for which you receive payment; 
b) The timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for 
which you receive payment (e.g. sales of event tickets months in advance of 
the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of chargebacks 
than sales of most other items or services)
R allows customers to pre-order and pay for goods which might not be delivered for several 
months. I appreciate there is a genuine business reason for this but according to PayPals 
user agreement, this model carries a higher risk of chargebacks. 
Rs user agreement with PayPal says that if it has reason to believe the user has engaged in 
restricted activities, it can block the account and it can hold funds for up to 180 days from the 
date of the last transaction. Although I dont doubt that the delay in accessing its funds was 
difficult for R, I cant reasonably find that PayPal was wrong to hold on to Rs funds in line 
with the terms of its account.
I can understand Mr Cs frustration with the way that PayPal has treated R but overall, I dont 
consider I can interfere in its business decision to terminate the account. Im sorry that this is 
likely to come as a disappointment to Mr C on behalf of R. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
