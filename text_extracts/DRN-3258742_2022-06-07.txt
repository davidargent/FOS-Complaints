The complaint
Mr E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc refused to consider his application for a 
payment holiday.
What happened
Mr E and his wife from whom he is separated have a joint mortgage with NatWest. In April 
2020, in response to a leaflet emailed by NatWest, Mr E asked for a three-month holiday on 
his mortgage payments. He was unable to make payments and emailed again in August 
2020 asking for urgent assistance and saying that he couldnt make payments because of 
cash flow difficulties. Mr E got no response. In the meantime, Mr E started to get payment 
demand letters. Mr E also enquired about equity release or a term extension and was told 
that the bank needed the joint account holders consent for that.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. As the emails Mr E 
sent were to an unmonitored email account and as he was advised not to send to that 
account, she didnt consider NatWest was at fault if it didnt receive the email. She also felt 
that NatWest was correct in not agreeing to a payment holiday which would increase the 
mortgage balance or a term extension without the consent of the joint mortgage holder. Mr E 
disagreed and asked for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This is an unfortunate situation where Mr E wanted to avail of a payment holiday but applied 
to an unmonitored email address. So, NatWest didnt get the request. Mr E was responding 
to an invitation from NatWest to apply and I can see that NatWest in that invitation says that 
he should respond through its Support Unit and theres a link to that. But Mr E appears not to 
have followed the link and NatWest didnt receive the request, so I cant fairly fault NatWest 
for not responding if they were unaware of the request.
Later when Mr E made a complaint, NatWest would have been aware that Mr E was looking 
at a payment holiday, term extension or equity release to deal with his problems in paying 
the mortgage. The question I have to consider is if NatWest acted fairly in not agreeing to 
these. The difficulty with any of these ways of dealing with financial difficulties is that they will 
have implications not only for Mr E but for the joint account holder and whereas they may be 
attractive to Mr E the joint account holder may simply not want the mortgage changed. There 
is no evidence that the other account holder wanted these changes and so I cant fault 
NatWest for not agreeing to a request to a change of mortgage by one account holder that 
may be unacceptable to the other account holder. On that basis I cant fairly uphold this 
complaint. 
I understand that there have been other communication difficulties with NatWest. As some of 
the communication between NatWest and Mr E relates to changes to the account, NatWest 
has asked for this communication to be by phone or letter and I dont consider that 
unreasonable or onerous. I believe there was some confusion about reference to a Money 
Advice Service but that appears to have been clarified and Mr E isnt required to use this 
service although he may wish to consider doing so. I also note that NatWest has amended 
its records to note that Mr and Mrs E arent in direct communication.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
