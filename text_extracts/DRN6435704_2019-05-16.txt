K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs D say Lloyds Bank PLC mis-sold them four mortgage payment protection 
insurance (MPPI) policies.
background
Mr and Mrs D took out MPPI  in April 2005  when they took out a mortgage and in October  
2005, July 2007 and March 2010  when they took out further  advances. The MPPI  only 
covered Mr D. 
They say the MPPI  was unnecessary because  of their circumstances at the time of sale.
Our adjudicator asked  for more information  about Mr and Mrs Ds circumstances at the time 
of each sale, but nothing was provided  despite multiple requests.  Our adjudicator  looked  at 
the complaint  based on the information  available, and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr and 
Mrs Ds representatives, a claims management  company, disagreed  with the adjudicators 
opinion, so the complaint has been  passed  to me.
While I provisionally reached  the same  outcome  as the adjudicator,  I issued a provisional 
decision to explain my reasons in more detail and give Mr and Mrs D and Lloyds an 
opportunity to respond. They have provided no additional comments or information. So this 
final decision  is unchanged from my provisional decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold this complaint.  I explain my reasons  below,  and have  done  so for each date of sale.
April 2005
The mortgage agreement described  the MPPI  as optional and Mr D signed a separate  
application form and direct debit instruction for it. So I think Lloyds made Mr and Mrs D 
aware that they had a choice about  buying the MPPI, and they chose to take it. 
Lloyds recommended the MPPI  to Mr and Mrs D, and it seems to have been  right for 
them based  on what Ive seen of their circumstances at the time. Mrs D wasnt  working, 
which is why the MPPI only covered Mr D. The MPPI wouldve paid out on top of any 
savings and sick or redundancy pay. That wouldve ensured their mortgage was paid for 
up to 12 months if Mr D couldnt work, and theyd have been able to keep their savings  
and any employee  benefits for other  things.
I think Lloyds couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. But even  if it 
had, I think Mr and Mrs D would still have bought it. The cost was shown on the 
mortgage agreement, so I think  they were aware  of it before the MPPI started  and it 
appears they didnt  have  any problems  with the cost at that point.
Its possible that Lloyds didnt point out the main things the policy  didnt cover. But Mr 
and Mrs D dont appear to have been affected  by any of those things.

Ive assumed they didnt have any.

Mr D signed a separate  application  form and direct debit instruction for the MPPI. And I 
think Mr and Mrs D wouldve  been aware  from their previous applications that they had a 
choice about taking MPPI. So I think  Lloyds made Mr and Mrs D aware that they had a 
choice about buying the MPPI,  and they chose to take it.
Lloyds recommended the MPPI  to Mr and Mrs D, and it seems to have been  right for 
them based  on what Ive seen of their circumstances at the time. Mrs D wasnt  working, 
which is why the MPPI only covered Mr D. The MPPI wouldve paid out on top of any 
savings and sick or redundancy pay. That wouldve ensured their mortgage was paid for 
up to 12 months if Mr D couldnt work, and theyd have been able to keep their savings  
and any employee  benefits for other  things.
Mr D discussed with Lloyds a possible medical  condition he had at the time of sale,  and 
was told that if the medical condition recurred within 24 months of the start of the policy it 
may not be covered. Mr and Mrs D still decided to take out the MPPI, which  suggests  
they were comfortable with this potential restriction in cover.
I think Lloyds couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. But even  if it 
had, I think Mr and Mrs D would still have bought it. The cost relative to the benefit being 
provided was similar  to what it was in previous sales.  So I have no reason to think  they 
wouldve declined cover as a result of the cost.
Its possible that Lloyds didnt point out the other main things the policy  didnt cover. But 
Mr and Mrs D dont appear  to have been affected by any of those things.
Ive taken into account Mr and Mrs Ds comments, including what  their representatives said 
in response to the adjudicators opinion.  The representatives referred to the credit 
agreement being  for a credit card, and said Mr and Mrs D maintained  that at no point was it 
clear to them that the policy  was optional.
Its unclear whether this response was actually specific  to Mr and Mrs D, given the credit 
agreement was a mortgage not a credit card. And Mr and Mrs D have argued throughout 
that the policy was unnecessary due to their savings and Mr Ds employee benefits  not 
that they were  unaware it was optional. So these  points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs D to 
accept or reject my decision  before  16 June  2019.
