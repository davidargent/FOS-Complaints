The complaint
Mr F complains Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays) mis sold him payment protection insurance 
(PPI) in connection with his credit card account.  
What happened
Mr F applied for a credit card over the internet in 2008. At the same time he took out a PPI 
policy to cover his credit card repayments. 
The policy cost £0.61 per £100 of the balance on Mr Fs credit card. A successful claim on 
the policy wouldve paid 10% of the outstanding balance for up to 12 months per claim if Mr 
F was unable to work due to accident or sickness only  the policy didnt cover him for 
unemployment.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint about the sale of PPI. Mr F disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. He says he was self-employed and wouldnt have been able to benefit 
from the policy so the complaint has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mr Fs complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F cant remember how he took out the policy but Barclays internal records show the 
policy  was applied for online when Mr F applied for a credit card. Barclays have given us a 
copy of the screen shots of the application form Mr F wouldve seen and completed when he 
applied for his credit card.
I can see that theres a separate section on the application form that deals with PPI. 
Within this section it briefly explains what the cost of PPI is along with what it protects 
against.
Directly under this it gives the customer the option to either select PPI with three different 
levels of cover:
1. life, accident and sickness, involuntary unemployment;
 
2.  life, accident and sickness; or
 
3. Life, involuntary unemployment.  
Or it gives the fourth option to select No to any PPI.
Barclays say Mr F wouldnt have been able to move on without selecting a level of PPI or 
declining the cover.  
So I think Mr F had PPI covering him for accident and sickness only because he selected to 
take it on the application form. If Mr F didnt want to take out PPI he couldve selected not to 
take the cover. So I think Mr F wouldve understood he had a choice in taking out the PPI 
and chose to take it because he wanted the cover.
Because the policy was taken over the internet I dont think Barclays recommended the PPI 
to Mr F so it didnt have to check if it was right for him. But it did have to make sure Mr F got 
the information he needed to decide if it was right for him. Its possible the information 
Barclays gave Mr F about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve been. But he chose to take 
out the PPI - so it looks like he wanted this type of cover.
Mr F says because he was self-employed he wouldnt have been able to benefit from the 
cover. But Mr F selected cover for accident and sickness only  not unemployment. So 
based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time it doesnt look like he was affected 
by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI cover he selected - so it would have been 
useful for him if something went wrong. 
It also looks like the PPI was affordable and if he no longer required the policy he was able 
to cancel it  which I see he did a few months after he took it out. So I dont think better 
information about the PPI would have put him off taking out the cover.
Which means Barclays doesnt have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr F or 
refund any interest and charges applied to his credit card that may have been incurred 
because of those premiums.
But Barclays has paid back some of the cost of the PPI to Mr F because: 
 
When the policy was sold, Barclays expected to get a high level of commission and 
profit share (more than 50% of the PPI premium) - so it should have told Mr F about 
that. Because Barclays didnt tell Mr F, that was unfair. 
 
To put that right, Barclays has paid back the amount of commission and profit share 
that was above 50% of the PPI premium - and I think that is fair in this case. 
 
My final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so Barclays Bank Plc does not have to pay back all of the 
cost of the PPI to Mr F.
But Barclays Bank Plc does have to pay back to Mr F any commission and profit share it got 
that was more than 50% of the PPI premium. I understand it has already done this, so I dont 
award any further compensation.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2020.
