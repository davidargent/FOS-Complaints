DRN-4280179
The complaint
Miss R has complained about the service Furness Building Society has provided in relation 
to the closure of her account.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators findings for broadly the same reasons. I will 
explain why.
Miss R provided identification in May 2016 when she opened the account. I accept 
that Miss R says based on the information it already held it met the threshold level 
which any objective person would consider satisfactory. But having reviewed the 
terms and conditions I am satisfied Furness reserves the right to carry out further 
identification checks and request further ID if it feels it is necessary. 
So, I cant say Furness has done anything wrong or acted outside the scope of its 
terms and conditions.
I have also been provided with an explanation of Furness internal processes and 
procedures. And again, I am satisfied that it acted in accordance with them.
As I am satisfied the bank acted in accordance with its terms and conditions and 
internal processes and procedures, I cant conclude it acted unreasonably or unfairly. 
So, I wont be asking it to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
