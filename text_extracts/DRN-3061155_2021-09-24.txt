The complaint
Mr G complains that an item he sold in working order, was later returned as faulty. He said
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refunded the buyers money. He complained, and sent a
report showing the item needed significant repair, but PayPal did nothing.
What happened
Mr G said hed sold a car stereo, and received payment for it through PayPal. He said the
buyer sent him pictures of it fitted and working. But then about a month after the sale, the
buyer said he wanted his money back. PayPal issued a refund to the buyer, and Mr G got
the item back. He said it arrived broken, and with parts rattling inside.
Mr G said that the buyer had been dishonest, and now he was left out of pocket. PayPal had
taken back the £310 for the original transaction, and charged him a dispute fee of £12. And
all Mr G had was a broken stereo, which would be very costly to repair.
PayPal said it had considered the buyers claim, and decided that Mr G should take the item
back. It had been returned, and Mr G had told it that the item was now broken, and he
wanted to appeal PayPals decision. But PayPal said that when it asked Mr G to supply an
independent report confirming this, he didnt do so. So PayPal said it had closed his claim.
Mr G sent us the independent report hed got, which explained a number of problems with
the item, and said that the stereo needed repairs costing £195 plus vat. It was in the form of
an email. Mr G said this had been sent to PayPal well within the deadline it had set.
Our investigator thought that the item was working when it was sent to the buyer, and then
wasnt working when it was received back by Mr G. Our investigator thought that the buyer
had kept the item for too long, and PayPal hadnt taken account of that when it had dealt
with the return. And she said PayPal had ignored Mr Gs independent report, confirming the
damage. She said PayPal should pay Mr G the £310 hed lost for the transaction, and refund
the £12 hed been charged for the dispute fee.
PayPal didnt agree. It said it never received any report from Mr G.
Mr G sent us evidence that he had sent the report to PayPal well within the deadline it had
set him. Our investigator sent this to PayPal. PayPal said it had received an email from Mr G
(which it did not share with us) but not the independent report it wanted.
PayPal then wrote again, to say that it had asked Mr G for a damage report document from
an unbiased third-party, qualified in the area of the item, outlining the extent of the damage
or alteration to the returned item. And it wanted him to send that before 15 March 2021.
PayPal said that Mr G had sent it something, but it had decided that what he sent was invalid
or not sufficient to support his case. PayPal didnt explain why the email Mr G sent wasnt
enough to change its mind.
PayPal wanted this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me
for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr G has told us that he had pictures of the item he sold, working in the buyers 
vehicle. Hes also shown us that the item was sold well over a month before the 
dispute was raised.
Like our investigator, I think that PayPal should have taken into account the length of 
time that had passed between the sale and the dispute.
Whilst I understand PayPal allows a considerable amount of time for buyers to open 
a dispute, I dont think that means, in this case, PayPal had no responsibility to ask 
the buyer to explain the delay in bringing the dispute. I havent seen anything to 
suggest it did that.
On the evidence Ive seen to date, I dont think that it was fair and reasonable for 
PayPal to decide that Mr G should accept the item back, and make a full refund.
Mr G then said the item he got back was broken. He supplied a quote for repairing 
the item. This appears to have come from the main UK authorised service centre for 
this item. Mr G has told us he paid £40 plus vat for that. PayPal hasnt explained why 
this wasnt sufficient to change its mind on this case.
I think that Mr G had shown the sort of evidence I would expect, to demonstrate that 
the item he got back was broken. And it doesnt seem likely, on the evidence Ive 
seen to date, that the item was broken when it was sold.
So, on what I have seen so far, I think that PayPal should refund the £310 it took 
from Mr G, and the £12 dispute fee it charged him. Because I have some doubts as 
to whether it was ever reasonable for PayPal to ask Mr G to take this item back, I 
also think it should make a compensation payment, to make up for the trouble that Mr 
G has been put to, and to cover the cost of the report he obtained. I think PayPal 
should pay £100 for that.
If PayPal has put negative markers on Mr Gs credit file as a result of this transaction, 
it should ensure that these are removed.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G said he didnt really have anything to add. He said that if PayPal had kept the phone 
conversations on this, those would show that even PayPals staff seemed to think this was 
ridiculous.
Because Ive already reached the view that PayPal made a mistake here, I dont think it 
would assist to listen to these calls. So I wont delay a resolution in this case, to do so now.PayPal said that it didnt agree with my provisional decision. It said its terms set out that Mr 
G might be required to take the item back and pay for shipping. And it said Mr G was also 
required to provide a damage report from an unbiased third party, qualified in the area of the 
item, and to supply this by 15 March. But PayPal said he didnt provide that report, he just 
forwarded an email. 
PayPal said that it relied on provisions in its agreement with Mr G, which require him to 
supply requested documentation. When he didnt supply it, that meant he wasnt covered by 
PayPals seller protection.
Finally PayPal said that it determines, within its sole discretion, whether someone qualifies 
for seller protection. 
PayPal didnt think its decision should be overturned. It said it was satisfied that it had acted 
fairly, and in accordance with its user agreement. 
I understand that what Mr G sent PayPal was in the form of an email. But PayPal hasnt 
explained why the document it wanted (a damage report from an unbiased third party, 
qualified in the area of the item) cant be supplied in the form of an email. I think that the 
email Mr G sent to PayPal provided the sort of information, and from the sort of source, that 
PayPal had requested. So I do not agree that it was either fair or reasonable for PayPal to 
disregard this, as it apparently has done. 
In short, I think that Mr G did send the information requested. 
I also think that if PayPal had fairly assessed what Mr G sent it, it would have reached a 
different decision. 
I dont think Im prevented from reaching this conclusion by the provisions in PayPals user 
agreement which say that PayPal makes these decisions in its sole discretion. I dont think 
those terms put PayPals actions outside of the scope of our services review. 
So I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund onto Mr Gs account 
the sum of £322, and pay him £100 in compensation. If PayPal has put negative markers on 
Mr Gs credit file as a result of this transaction, it must ensure that these are removed.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
