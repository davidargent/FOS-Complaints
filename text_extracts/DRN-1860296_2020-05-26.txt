The complaint
Mr and Mrs B are unhappy about the service they received from Aldermore Bank Plc when
they applied to remortgage their portfolio of buy-to-let properties.
What happened, What Ive decided  and why
I issued my provisional decision earlier this month. A further copy of this has been provided 
with this final decision and forms part of it.
Both parties accepted my findings. Mr and Mrs B asked some questions about what had 
happened. As these have been answered by our investigator, I've nothing further to add 
here other than to reiterate my apologies to all the parties involved.
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint and, having done so, I've no reason to 
depart from my provisional findings.
Putting things right
In line with its offer, Aldermore Bank Plc should pay £4,000 to Mr and Mrs B in full and final 
settlement of their complaint. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against Aldermore Bank Plc but only insofar as I'm satisfied the offer
of £4,000 in total it's put forward is a fair and reasonable resolution to this complaint. Under 
the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 June 2020.
