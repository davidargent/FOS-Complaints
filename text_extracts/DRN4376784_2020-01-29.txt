This complaint is about six short-terms loans Mr Lender provided to Mr E between 
June 2016 and July 2017. Mr Es borrowing history is as follows  (I have  rounded the figures):

Our adjudicator considered the case and partially  upheld  Mr Es complaint  and thought loans 
five and six shouldnt  have been given.  
Mr Lender disagreed and as the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed  to me for 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN43767842But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr E could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr E didnt provide  anything further to the adjudicator in response to her not upholding his 
complaint about  loans  one to four. Because there doesnt appear  to be an outstanding 
dispute about these loans, I wont be making a finding on these loans in this decision. But I 
have thought about these  loans in the overall  context of Mr Es lending  relationship.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans five and six would most likely  
have shown that Mr E was having problems with managing his money.
I say this because  its clear that Mr E was consistently and concurrently using other  short-
term lending providers which would indicate financial difficulty. Mr Lender  has said it was 
aware of this but any borrowing Mr E took and the subsequent repayments, left him with 
sufficient disposable  income. But I see Mr Lenders  figures showed that for some of the 
borrowing, the short-term  repayments accounted for a significant proportion of Mr Es 
income.
Ref: DRN43767843Mr Lender has said Mr E repaid some  of his loans  early because he said he wanted to 
reduce the amount of interest he paid on the borrowing.  But I dont agree this is evidence 
that Mr E was sustainably  repaying  his loans. By settling loans early, it could be an indication 
he was borrowing elsewhere to offset  the loan he had with Mr Lender  and could then return  
for further  borrowing. I note this is what Mr E did after he repaid the largest loan - £600  - 
early. He returned for more borrowing ten days later. 
So, I am upholding Mr Es complaint about loans  five and six.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans five and six;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five and six from Mr Es credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Es complaint. 
PDL Finance  Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
