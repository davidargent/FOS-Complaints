K821x#15complaint
Mr J is unhappy that an error made by Fidelis Financial Planning  Limited led him to go 
over his Lifetime Allowance  (LTA) and incur a Lifetime Allowance tax charge.
background
In 2008 Mr J took benefits from his employers pension. The benefits  from this plan were 
worth 60.49% of Mr Js LTA. However,  this figure was incorrectly  noted by Fidelis  as 50.49%.
Mr J had another plan with a different provider. On the advice of Fidelis Mr J made a 
payment of £25,000 to this plan in 2008. A further  payment  of £20,000  was made  in 
2009.
In 2011 Mr J applied for fixed  protection of £1.8 million on his plan. This was effective  from
April 2012. In 2011 Mr Js benefits  were  thought  to be worth £1.7m which was below the
£1.8m limit.
However Fidelis realised in 2014  that it had incorrectly calculated the value of Mr J's benefits 
and that Mr J had in fact exceeded the LTA.  In 2015  Mr J took benefits when the LTA was 
exceeded by £245,339.  He paid tax on this of £134,936 (or 55%).
Mr J complained to Fidelis  about the advice that he had received. In response it said:
It agreed the wrong LTA figure was noted.  Had the right figure been noted it 
wouldve realised Mr J was closer to reaching  his LTA.
It wouldve advised Mr J to have taken benefits  in 2009.
Mr J wouldve invested the 25% tax free cash in equities, unit trust and cash  deposits
(which were the funds  he was invested during the period 2009 to 2015).
It calculated  that Mr J had suffered a financial loss of £2,551 as a result  of the error.
Mr J didnt agree with Fidelis calculations.  He said he didnt need an income in 2009. 
Considering the growth he wouldve received from this investment his calculations 
showed that his financial loss was £74,382.
One of our adjudicators  thought the complaint  should be upheld for the following reasons:
The incorrect LTA percentage was recorded by Fidelis in 2008.
Fidelis calculations  were based on the financial loss suffered  by Mr J not taking 
benefits earlier. But she didnt agree that had the correct LTA been  noted in 2008  
Mr J wouldnt  have been advised to have taken benefits then. This is because  
Fidelis couldnt have foreseen that there wouldnt be any further LTA increases.
Had the contributions made in 2008  and 2009 not been  made  Mr J wouldve still 
gone over his LTA and paid a charge. But the two contributions increased the 
value of the pension  fund. They therefore increased the LTA charge incurred.
The main  focus should  be on the financial loss suffered by Mr J as a result  of the 
two contributions made  in 2008  and 2009.
She calculated Mr Js loss on this basis to be £4,197.87.
In addition for the trouble and upset caused Fidelis  should pay Mr J £300.
The adjudicator also said any advice for Mr J to have taken benefits earlier  than he did 
Ref: DRN38843542wouldve increased his taxable income.  In her view there wasnt a need for Mr J to 
have taken a lump sum.
Mr J didnt agree and argued  that:
He shouldnt have  been advised to have made the two contributions he made in 
2008 and 2009.
He shouldve been advised  at some point  to have taken benefits before he went 
over his LTA.
Tax free lump sum and income  couldve been taken to have avoided him going  
over his LTA.
In my provisional decision I stated that I was minded to uphold the complaint and I noted that 
the parties had agreed that there was an error in the figure  recorded  by the business and 
that if the correct information  had been recorded Mr J would have taken  benefits  from the 
uncrystallised benefits in his pension as soon as he could. I took this to be August 2009.       
Mr J has stated that he would  have taken the tax free lump  sum at that time but no income 
(as this was not required).
In order  to determine the amount of the loss my proposed method was to:
1.Calculate the total value of the net benefits  that would  have  been  payable if benefits had 
been taken from Mr Js uncrystallised funds as at 10 August 2009.
2.Calculate the total value of the net benefits  that would  have  been  payable if benefits had 
been taken from Mr Js uncrystallised funds as at 11 June 2015.
3.Revalue the net benefits as at 10 August 2009 (1) to 11 June 2015 in line with the return 
achieved on the uncrystallised fund.
My calculations showed that there  was a loss as at 11 June 2015 of £39,502.
Mr J accepted the calculation but the business did not. 
The business has argued that any redress should  aim to put the complainant  back into the 
position that they would have been in had the error in the LTA percentage not arisen. The 
representative for the business argued that if Mr J was aware that he was closer  to the 
Lifetime Allowance Limit than anticipated he would  have taken the benefits as income 
whether this was required  or not and that the calculations  that I had carried  out were  
inappropriate.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has been agreed that Mr J was badly advised by the business and the dispute is about the 
level of redress that is payable.
Ref: DRN38843543The aim of my decision is to put Mr J into the position that he would have been in had the 
error not arisen  and he had received appropriate advice in 2009. 
I note that Mr J has calculated a higher loss and the business has determined  a lower  loss 
figure. It is important to stress that it is my role as an ombudsman to come up with a method 
that I consider to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case as it is not 
possible to be exact with regards to the loss incurred.
In this case I have assumed that Mr J would have taken benefits when he met the business 
on 10 August 2009 as that was first time that he had met the business when he had 
exceeded the lifetime  allowance  limit of £1.75  million.  
It would therefore  have been  possible for Mr J to either pay the Lifetime Allowance Tax 
charge on the excess over the £1.75m at the rate of 55%. Or to pay 25% on the excess over 
£1.75m as a tax charge  and to take benefits  from the excess  as income that would  be 
subject to income tax at the rate of 40%. This would equate to an overall  tax rate on the 
excess of 55% which is the same  as he would have suffered if the free standing  tax charge 
on the excess had been applied. 
This can be seen as follows:
On 10 August  2009
Mr Js fund was worth  £484,520 the LTA was worth 1.75m 
The balance of the LTA was  £343,525(19.63%*£1,750,000) 
The excess  over the LTA was £140,995
If the excess over the LTA is to be used to provide income it would  be subject to free 
standing tax charge  of 25% so that the net sum available to provide  an income would be 
75%*£140,995 =£105,746.30 to provide income  
Allowing for tax at 40% on the income  taken leads  to a net value of £63,448. This is the 
same as the value after payment of the 55% tax charge.
.
The business has argued that Mr J would have  taken  the benefits  over the LTA in 2009  as 
income. However, in my opinion this cannot  be known and given that Mr J took the excess 
benefits in 2015 as a lump sum I have assumed in the redress calculation that Mr J would  
have also taken the excess benefits in 2009  as a lump  sum.  
Given this I determined that the loss as at 11 June 2015  was £39,502. I stated that interest 
should be added at the rate of 8% per annum simple from the date of calculation  to the date 
of settlement. l consider that this is appropriate  in the circumstances  of this case. I also 
proposed an award of £300 for the distress  and inconvenience that Mr J has suffered.
Having reviewed all of the submissions that have been made  on this complaint I have not 
been persuaded to change my mind.  In my opinion  the redress proposed in this case is 
appropriate.
Ref: DRN38843544my final decision
I uphold this complaint against Fidelis Financial  Planning Limited and direct that it pay the 
redress of £39,502  as at 11 June 2015 together with interest at the rate of 8% per annum 
simple from the date of calculation to the date of settlement. I also award  £300  for the 
distress and inconvenience that Mr J has suffered.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2019.
