The complaint
Mr R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr R entered into a purchase agreement in October 2011 to buy some holiday club 
membership points. The price of the membership points was £4,800 and he also entered 
into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He 
agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £68.46 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan 
was repaid in August 2016.
Mr Rs representative made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance in August 2018 under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the terms of the agreements were 
unfair, an undisclosed commission was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday 
company and the membership was misrepresented to Mr R. Barclays Partner Finance said 
that Mr R was out of time to bring any claim in respect of the purchase agreement but it also 
set out the reasons that it didnt uphold his claim. Mr R wasnt satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service that: the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Rs ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured him into entering into the 
agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure him; and the 
membership was misrepresented to him; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to 
section 140A. It said that his claim should also be considered under section 75 of that Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim to 
turn it down. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mr R and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He said that he hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr R.
Mr Rs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that Mr R doesnt accept our investigators recommendations and has 
described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mr R.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Rs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to 
his claims;
Mr Rs claim to Barclays Partner Finance was made under section 140A but our 
investigator also considered his claim under section 75 - Im not determining the 
outcome of any claims under section 75 or 140A in this decision as only a court 
would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Im not persuaded that Mr Rs representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in 
August 2018 made claims under section 75 or that Barclays Partner Finances 
response to that letter included a response to any such claims but, for the reasons 
set out below, I consider that any such claim would now be time-barred;
any claim under section 75 in these circumstances would be that the membership 
was misrepresented to Mr R by the holiday company and that he wouldnt have 
bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr R could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the membership in October 2011 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until August 2018, nearly seven years later so was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that any 
misrepresentation claim under section 75 would now be time-barred;
Mr Rs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner has provided an account statement which show that Mr Rs loan 
was repaid in August 2016 and his claims under section 140A were made to Barclays 
Partner Finance by his representative in August 2018 - so I dont consider that Mr Rs 
claim under section 140A is time-barred;
Mr Rs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance didnt make a proper 
assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr R - Barclays Partner Finance hasnt 
provided any evidence about its assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr R 
but Mr R says that his salary in 2011 was £30,696.96;
the loan account statement shows that Mr R made the loan repayments of £68.46 
from December 2011 to July 2016, only missing one payment, he made a payment of 
£3,000 to the loan account in October 2015 and the loan was repaid in full in August 
2016;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr R complained about the affordability of the 
loan or Barclays Partner Finances affordability assessment until his complaint was 
made to this service in January 2019 (more than two years after hed repaid the 
loan); 
if the loan was unaffordable for Mr R, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
him to have contacted Barclays Partner Finance before he repaid the loan - and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable 
for Mr R in October 2011 when it was made to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R was unduly 
pressured into buying the membership points or entering into the loan agreement in 
October 2011 or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against 
him  Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr R complained to Barclays Partner 
Finance about those issues until August 2018 (nearly seven years after the loan had 
been made to him) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have 
complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mr Rs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance should have told him about 
any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr R 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan was mis-sold 
to Mr R;
Mr R signed documents including the purchase agreement, the terms and conditions, 
a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given and the loan 
agreement in October 2011  and his representative has described the way in which 
it says that the membership was misrepresented to him;
those misrepresentations would have been in October 2011 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr R complained to the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until his representatives letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance in August 2018 (nearly seven years later) and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have complained about any such issues before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr R by the holiday company or that he was induced into entering 
into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Rs relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances October 2018 response to Mr Rs claims 
was fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr R about his loan; and
I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that his representative has described and the 
difficulties that hes experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr R 
any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2023.
