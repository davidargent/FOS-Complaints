The complaint
Mr J complains that hes not been treated fairly by Motability Operations Limited in 
connection with the amount that hed been charged for a car that was supplied to him under 
a hire agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr J under a hire agreement with Motability Operations that he 
electronically signed in October 2019. The hire agreement shows that Mr J was to make an 
advance rental payment of £18,995, which included £625 for a four point tie down system in 
the rear and an advance adaptation rental payment of £1,445 for a wheelchair docking 
station  and he was also to pay £250 for a required modification to the drivers door.
Mr J complained to Motability Operations that it should have covered or subsidised the cost 
of the tie down system, the docking station and the modification. It said that the cost of the 
four point tie down system should have been covered and agreed to pay for it. It also said 
that the wheelchair docking system had been added to its list of subsidised adaptations so 
the cost had been reduced from £1,650 to £1,445. It also said that it had discussed with Mr J 
the option of applying for a charity grant towards those costs but it wasnt something that he 
was keen to pursue.
Mr J wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He thought that Motability Operations had 
treated Mr J in the same way it would treat another customer in the same position, he was 
satisfied that it had followed the legal requirements for the car and he thought that it had 
responded to his concerns and provided some financial support.
Mr J has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that that will 
give him peace of mind given that he feels strongly that he hasnt been treated fairly by 
Motability Operations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - we have no regulatory or disciplinary role over 
those businesses and Im unable to require any of them to change the way that it 
conducts its business;
its clear that Mr J feels very strongly that Motability Operations hasnt treated him 
fairly and hes referred to the strength of its financial position and a report on its 
pricing practices;
I thank Mr J for providing me with detailed information about his situation but I can 
only uphold his complaint if Im satisfied that theres enough evidence to show that 
Motability Operations hasnt treated him fairly and reasonably in connection with the 
car that it supplied to him under the hire agreement; 
Motability Operations says that the cost of the four point tie down system should 
have been covered and agreed to pay for it;
it also says that the price of the wheelchair docking station had increased to £1,895 
so it has provided £450 of financial support for all of its customers who require that 
adaptation and that it has provided Mr J with information about grants that might be 
available to provide further support but that he didnt want to apply for them because 
of the delay that it would cause;
Motability Operations has described the legal requirements for the applicable cars 
and says that the automated docking system selected by Mr J is fitted in addition to 
the manual system and is a complex adaptation so its not possible nor financially 
viable for it to cover the full cost of the adaptation;
its clear that Mr J considers that the automated docking system that he has is a 
requirement for him to be able to use the car properly so should be paid for by 
Motability Operations - but I consider that it has complied with its legal requirements 
in relation to the car that was supplied to him and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that it should have paid for that system or that it has 
treated him unfairly or unreasonably; 
the prices that are charged by Motability Operations are a commercial decision for it 
to make  this service doesnt normally interfere with a businesss legitimate 
commercial decisions and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for 
me to interfere with the prices that it has charged Mr J in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Motability Operations 
has charged Mr J unfairly or unreasonably or that the policy that it has used for those 
charges is unfair or unreasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Motability Operations to 
refund to Mr J any of the payments that hes made to it for the car, to pay him any 
other compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2021.
