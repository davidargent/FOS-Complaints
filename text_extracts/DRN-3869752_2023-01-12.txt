The complaint
Mrs C complains that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited provided her with incorrect 
statements for her personal pension plan in 2020 and 2021.
What happened
On 20 March 2020, Aviva told Mrs C her pension was invested into its Property Fund, and 
transactions in and out of it had been suspended. Aviva gave Mrs C the option to redirect 
her policy premiums into other funds. Mrs C instructed Aviva to invest 50% of her premiums 
into the Aviva Mixed Investment (40-85% Shares) fund and 50% of her premiums into the 
Aviva UK Index Tracking Funds. Aviva confirmed it had processed her instructions to 
redirect her funds on 1 July 2020.
Aviva sent Mrs C her pension plans annual statements in July 2020 and August 2021 but 
neither of these statements showed correct fund balances. Mrs C queried the statements 
with Aviva on 9 September 2021 and it said it would send out revised statements within ten 
working days. But Aviva didnt send the statements out as promised. Mrs C called Aviva on 
5 November 2021, when it told her it could take three months to issue a revised statement. A 
revised statement was then sent on 12 November 2021  and Mrs C said this statement also 
contained incorrect fund values. Mrs C complained about this.
Aviva issued a final response to Mrs C on 30 November 2021. Aviva said it now realised it 
didnt action Mrs Cs fund switch correctly, which contributed to the incorrect statements 
being issued. Aviva agreed with Mrs C that its 12 November 2021 statement was inaccurate. 
So, it issued a revised statement on 29 November 2021. To apologise for the inconvenience 
caused by the errors in its statements, Aviva said it would pay Mrs C £200 compensation. 
Mrs C emailed Aviva on 1 December 2021 as the statement still didnt look right to her. On 
7 December 2021, Aviva sent Mrs C another statement, which she said still contained a fund 
value that differed from previous statements was still not right (that Ill explain in more detail 
below). Mrs C has since chased Aviva several times for a correct statement. Aviva said it 
wasnt in a position to reply to Mrs C and reminded her she had six months from its final 
response to refer her complaint to our Service.
Mrs C asked us to investigate her complaint in March 2022. Mrs C said she wants an 
independent actuary to ensure the payments were allocated correctly. Mrs C also wanted 
Aviva to pay for an Independent Financial Adviser to review her pension arrangements and 
help her transfer her pension elsewhere. Finally, Mrs C said she wants Aviva to apologise for 
its lack of communication and shambolic complaints procedure. 
After referring her complaint to our Service, Mrs C says she received another incorrect 
annual statement from Aviva in September 2022. This 6 September 2022 statement showed 
the value of Mrs Cs funds on 21 May 2021 was £266,752.99. But on the 7 December 2021 
statement shows the plan value on 21 May 2021 was £281,556.76.
One of our investigators looked into Mrs Cs complaint and noted the 3 July 2020 statement 
shows the plan value was £216,788.56 on 21 May 2020. But on the 7 December 2021 
statement, the plan value was £228,816.15 on 21 May 2020.  In response, Aviva said the 
July 2020 statement was incorrect as it hadnt considered a single premium of £18,750 
which Mrs C paid into her plan in February 2020. 
In October 2022, Aviva confirmed to Mrs C that the value of her pension on 
21 May 2020 was correct in its 7 December 2021 statement. Our investigator was satisfied 
Aviva had explained the cause of the incorrect statements lay with its error in processing 
Mrs Cs request to redirect her funds. He was also satisfied Aviva had explained the reason 
for its incorrect valuation on statements before 7 December 2021. Our Investigator didnt 
think there was a need for an independent actuary to assess Mrs Cs pension but he did 
recommend:
Aviva should assess whether Mrs C had suffered any financial loss as a result of its 
errors on its statements. 
Fix the cause of the errors in its annual statements so Mrs C does not have the same 
problems again.
Aviva pay Mrs C an additional £300 compensation  so £500 in total, as £200 was 
paid after Aviva issued its final response. Our investigator thought this was fair 
because of the trouble and upset caused to Mrs C, including having to chase Aviva 
numerous times over many months. 
Our investigator also explained to Mrs C that any complaint about the 6 September 2022 
statement would need to be referred to Aviva and would not form part of this complaint. 
Mrs C accepted our Investigators recommendation but Aviva didnt respond, despite our 
Investigator contacting it numerous times. So, this has come to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On 8 August 2018, Aviva responded to a complaint by Mrs C that her statements were 
incorrect and sent her a cheque for £100 to apologise. This complaint is not being 
considered under this complaint reference, but Ive mentioned it here as Mrs C has told us 
about it to highlight the ongoing issues shes experienced with her annual statements. Ill 
now turn to the subject of this complaint.
I should first clarify that Im only able to consider Mrs Cs complaints about the inaccuracies 
in Avivas statements issued in 2020 and until the date it issued its final response to Mrs Cs 
complaint  30 November 2021.  I note our Investigator has referred to errors in Avivas 
7 December 2021 statement, but it remains that Aviva has admitted it made numerous errors 
in its statements issued before its final response. I think Aviva has explained the cause of 
these errors (as outlined above) and, like our Investigator, I think Aviva should take steps to 
avoid it making the same mistakes again. However, I cant ensure Aviva wont make errors 
in future. Given the significant number of errors Aviva has made with its statements in recent 
years, its very possible these errors will happen again. If this is the case, Mrs C may need to 
refer a new complaint about any incorrect statement issued after 30 November 2021 to 
Aviva to consider afresh. 
I agree with our Investigator that Aviva should check whether Mrs C has been caused any 
financial loss as a result of the errors on its statements issued after its first final response on 
8 August 2021 and Avivas final response to this complaint (dated 30 November 2021). But I 
note that in its letter of 10 September 2021, Aviva assured Mrs C her fund switch was actioned correctly and she holds 50% of her funds in its Aviva Mixed Investment (40-85% 
Shares) Series 2 fund and 50% of her funds are held in the Aviva UK Index Tracking Funds 
Series 2, as per her request. Ive not seen any evidence that shows a financial loss has 
occurred.  but, given the length of time that Aviva has persisted with issuing inaccurate 
statements, I dont think its unreasonable for it to assess and explain, in simple terms, to 
Mrs C whether its errors in its statements issued between July 2020 and 30 November 2021 
have caused her any financial loss and, if not, then why the values are accurate. But as 
theres no evidence of loss at this point, and Aviva has tried to explain the reasons for the 
inaccuracies in its statements issued until 30 November 2021, I dont think it would be 
reasonable for me to ask Aviva to pay for an actuary or IFA to review statements issued 
before this date or advise Mrs C on transferring her pension elsewhere. 
I agree with our Investigator that total compensation of £500 fairly represents the trouble and 
upset Aviva has caused Mrs C. It was Mrs C, not Aviva, that spotted its errors. She chased 
Aviva many times for answers without success. The many revised statements sent out 
continued to be inaccurate, which I think reasonably compounded Mrs Cs upset and 
concerns about Avivas competence. Aviva said it would pay Mrs C £200 compensation 
within two weeks of its final response of 30 November 2021. If Aviva has already paid £200 
compensation, it should pay Mrs C an additional £300. If Aviva hasnt paid Mrs C the £200 
yet, it should pay her £500 compensation in total.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I uphold this complaint and require Aviva Life & Pensions 
UK Limited to do what Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2023.
