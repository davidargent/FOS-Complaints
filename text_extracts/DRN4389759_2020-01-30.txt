my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN43897592refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs K could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ks complaint. 
Our adjudicator felt that loans  1 to 3 shouldnt be upheld. Mrs K appears to have  accepted 
the adjudicators  findings about these loans,  so as these loans are no longer in dispute,  I 
wont be considering  them further. But I have thought about these loans in the context of 
Mrs Ks overall lending relationship with Sunny. 
Sunny has told us that before agreeing to lend Mrs K any of the loans  it enquired about her 
income and expenses at the time to check if the loans were affordable for her. But our 
adjudicator felt, and I agree, that by loan 4 Sunny shouldve carried  out more thorough 
checks of Mrs Ks financial  situation. And that proportionate checks  at this point wouldve 
uncovered that Mrs K:
was taking out short-term lending with other  providers
regularly had a low bank balance  under £100
was gambling significant amounts 
As a result, its likely Mrs K may have had an issue with repaying  her loans in a sustainable  
fashion. Gambling  is highly  likely  to lead to debt. And with a debt situation arising out of, or 
contributed by, gambling, then a properly carried our affordability assessment was likely to 
lead to a responsible lender to conclude that the loan  or any subsequent ones - was not 
affordable for an applicant  in that situation. And this coupled  with the fact that Mrs K had 
other short-term loans with other providers ought to have led to Sunny to realise  that it 
shouldnt have lent Mrs K any further loans. So, Im upholding Mrs Ks complaint about loans 
4 onwards on this basis.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. Our adjudicator felt that this point had been  
reached by loan 6, however given the fact that these loans  were  all taken out within  the 
space of five months, I dont think it had yet reached the point  considering how long these 
loans were meant to run for - to suggest that a  pattern  of lending had developed.  
Ref: DRN43897593So, I am upholding the complaint about  loans 4 onwards and Sunny should put things right 
as set out below.  
putting things right 
refund  all interest and charges Mrs K paid on loans 4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 - 9 from Mrs Ks credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs K a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above I am partially  upholding  Mrs Ks complaint and Elevate Credit  
International Limited should compensate her as outlined  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
