The complaint
Miss J complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as Moneyway, wasnt of satisfactory quality. Shes being 
helped with her complaint by her partner.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss J under a hire purchase agreement with Moneyway in 
September 2019. The car broke down in April 2020 and a manufacturers dealer said that 
the cars diesel particulate filter had been removed and that the car had been tampered with 
and modified so the manufacturers warranty was void. It quoted £3,867.44 for the required 
repairs.
Miss J complained to Moneyway but it said that it was her responsibility to provide evidence 
that the faults were present at the point of sale. She wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She thought that the 
car had covered a significant number of miles, so it was unlikely that the fault wouldve been 
present or developing at the point of sale - and she said that it was more likely that the 
modifications were made after the point of sale. 
Miss J has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
to the investigators recommendations in detail and says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that the warranty should be reinstated and that the car should be repaired. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Moneyway, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss J - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Miss J was more than two years old, had been driven for 
22,566 miles and had a price of £14,500;
the car broke down in April 2020, more than six months after it had been supplied to 
Miss J, and a manufacturers dealer said that the car had been modified and its 
diesel particulate filter had been removed which invalidated the manufacturers 
warranty  it quoted £3,867.44 for the required repairs and its estimate records the 
cars mileage as 43,706  so the car had been driven for more than 21,000 miles 
since it was supplied to Miss J; 
Miss J says that she hasnt carried out any modifications to the car and it was 
supplied to her like that but the dealer says that the car wasnt supplied to her with 
those modifications;
Moneyway says the manufacturers dealer has not been able to say when the 
modifications would have taken place, the car passed an MOT test in March 2020 
when the diesel particulate filter would have been checked and Miss J wouldnt have 
been able to use the car to drive more than 21,000 miles if the diesel particulate filter 
was not in it when it was supplied to her;
in circumstances such as these, where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or 
contradictory, I have to make my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider circumstances;
Im not persuaded that its likely than Miss J would have been able to drive the car for 
more than 21,000 miles if the diesel particulate filter had been missing when the car 
was supplied to her;
the car passed an MOT test, which wouldve included a diesel particulate filter check, 
in March 2020 when its mileage was recorded as 42,185 and I consider it to be more 
likely than not a missing diesel particulate filter would have been noticed at that time;
its clear that the cars rear lights and number plate had been altered before the car 
was serviced in January 2020 but Im not persuaded that its likely that the diesel 
particulate filter was missing at that time;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car broke down in 
April 2020 as a result of a fault that was present or developing when the car was 
supplied to Miss J in September 2019 or that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality at 
that time;
Miss J has received a safety recall from the manufacturer about the car and it says 
that it wants to check the cars exhaust gas recirculation cooler and replace it if 
required  but that isnt enough to show that theres a fault with the car or that it 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss J;
Miss J says that the car wasnt properly registered with the DVLA when the car was 
supplied to her  but her partner has said that Moneyway offered to unwind the 
agreement and take the car back but Miss J wanted to keep it because of the amount 
of money that had been spent on the car since it was supplied to her;
I sympathise with Miss J for the issues that shes had with the car and for the repair 
costs that shes now facing, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Moneyway has acted incorrectly in its dealings with her;
Miss Js complaint is made about Moneyway but the warranty was provided to her by 
the manufacturer of the car - Im unable to require the manufacturer to take any 
action, even if I thought that it had acted incorrectly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Moneyway to pay for the car to be repaired, to allow Miss J to reject it, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2021.
