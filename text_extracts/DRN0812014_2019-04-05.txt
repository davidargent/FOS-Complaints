Miss B complains  that three  loans  she took out with CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick 
Quid for loans 1 & 3 and Pounds to Pocket for loan 2) were unaffordable.  
background
Miss B took out one short  term loan and two instalment loans with CashEuroNet.  These are: 
Loan Date amount Highest repayment
Instalments Date repaid
1 18/12/2012 £150 £187.50 1 28/12/2012
2 03/01/2013 £1050 £163.10 12 Still outstanding
3 06/03/2013 £400 £500.00 3 Still outstanding
Before providing  the loans,  CashEuroNet says that it asked Miss B about her income  and 
carried out a credit check. It says that these  checks were  proportionate  in all of the 
circumstances that it knew about  at the time of granting the loans.
Miss B says CashEuroNet  should have carried out better checks  to assess  whether the 
loans were affordable  for her. She says if it had done, it would have seen  that she couldnt 
afford them.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Bs complaint. He thought CashEuroNet  carried out 
proportionate checks for loan 1 but didnt do so for loans 2 or 3. He then went on to conclude  
that Miss B would have been able to afford the repayments given in loan 2 anyway if 
proportionate checks had been carried out. But didnt  think  Miss B could afford repayments 
for loan 3 and CashEuroNet would have seen this if it had carried  out sufficient checks  for 
this loan.
Miss B did not agree so her complaint has come to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did CashEuroNet, at the time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Miss B would be able to repay  in a sustainable  way?
oIf not, would those checks have shown  that Miss B would have been able to do so.
Taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Miss Bs indebtedness  in a way that was otherwise unsustainable or 
harmful?
Did CashEuroNet act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ref: DRN08120142If I determine that CashEuroNet did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Miss B 
and that she has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what  is fair compensation.
CashEuroNet was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make  checks  to see whether   
Miss B could afford  to pay back the loans before it lent to her. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss B was borrowing  and the length of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks CashEuroNet had to do.
CashEuroNet says it asked about Miss Bs income  and says it did a credit check each time.
I agree  with the adjudicator that the checks  CashEuroNet  carried out on Loan 1 were 
proportionate. Loan 1 was taken out on 18/12/12 was Miss Bs first loan with CashEuroNet. 
She declared to them that her income  was £1500 with the repayment amount being £187.50. 
I think when I take into consideration the amount of the repayment and the income that   
Miss B had declared it would have shown CashEuroNet  that this first loan was affordable. So 
I dont think at this stage it needed to carry out any further checks. 
Miss B took out loan 2 on 03/01/2013. This was an instalment loan and was due to be repaid 
over 12 repayments. I think because of this, CashEuroNet should have carried  out further  
checks and also asked  Miss B about her regular financial  commitments.  But if it had done  
this, it still would have  seen that Miss B could  afford  the repayments when they fell due. This 
is because the regular monthly expenditure  that I have seen Miss B would have had at this 
time, would still have left her with enough disposable income  to be able to meet the 
repayments of the loan.  So I think loan 2 was affordable anyway  for Miss B.
Miss B has said in a recent submission that she thinks CashEuroNet should  have carried out 
a full financial review  when it agreed  to lend her loan 2 and would have seen that she 
couldnt afford to repay it. But I dont think this would  have been proportionate.  This was only 
Miss Bs second loan with CashEuroNet and the monthly repayment  amounts hadnt 
increased from her first loan. So I think proportionate  checks at this stage should have 
included checks on Miss Bs regular monthly expenditure along with her declared income 
and this would have shown Miss B could afford the repayments for this loan. 
Miss B took out loan 3 on 06/03/2013 and by this stage shed been borrowing with regularity. 
In addition, this loan had quite a high final repayment due of £500. This was significantly 
higher than any other repayment that Miss B had made. I think  at this stage it wouldve been 
reasonable and proportionate for CashEuroNet to have asked further questions  and carried  
out more checks.
I think CashEuroNet should have been  looking to carry  out a complete review of Miss Bs 
finances. If it had carried  out further checks on loan 3, it would have seen she had a number 
of other  financial commitments  to pay at that time along with the loan repayments for loan 2. 
When these additional  amounts are considered alongside Miss Bs normal living  costs, then 
it is clear to me that by the time she had to repay  the final instalment of £500, she would 
have not had enough disposable income in order to meet it. Loan 3 was not affordable for 
Miss B and further checks  would have shown this.
On balance I dont  think loan 3 shouldve been granted.  So CashEuroNet  should put right 
what it did wrong.
my final decision
Ref: DRN08120143My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick 
Quid and Pounds  to Pocket) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss B paid on loan 3;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Miss Bs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet must  give Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
It appears Miss B still owes  CashEuroNet some of the principal  balance  she borrowed on 
her final loan. CashEuroNet may deduct  this from the compensation that is due to her. But, 
to be clear, that outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and 
charges, but taking  account of any repayments Miss B has made  on that loan as though  they 
were applied against the principal sum borrowed.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 May 2019.
