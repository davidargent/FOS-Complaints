The complaint
Mr H complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited, trading as Land Rover Financial Services, wasn't of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Land Rover Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for 
ensuring that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H - whether or 
not it was of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, 
including the age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr H nearly three years old, had been driven for about 
27,000 miles and had a price of £24,739;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will depend on a number of factors;
Mr H clearly feels very strongly that there's a fault with the car's bluetooth 
connectivity and he's described in detail the issues that he's had with it and the visits 
that he's made to the dealer and another manufacturer's dealer about that issue;
he also complains that the car's windscreen was chipped and that its brakes were 
corroded when the car was supplied to him;
the car had passed an MOT test in November 2018 (a month before it was supplied 
to Mr H - and its mileage at that time was 26,994) and a multi-point inspection 
checklist was completed by the dealer before the car was supplied to Mr H - neither 
the MOT test nor the inspection identified a chipped windscreen or corroded brakes - 
and Mr H didn't contact the dealer about those issues until at least two months after 
the car had been supplied to him;
if the windscreen had been chipped or there was an issue with the brakes 
being corroded when the car was supplied to him, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect Mr H to have raised those issues with the dealer sooner than 
he did - and I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that those 
issues were present when the car was supplied to Mr H or that it wasn't of 
satisfactory quality at that time because of those issues;
the car has been inspected multiple times by the dealer and another manufacturer's 
dealer to investigate an issue with the car's bluetooth connectivity - but no fault has 
been found;Mr H has described the issues in detail but there's no other evidence to show that 
there's a fault with the car - so although I sympathise with Mr H for the difficulties that 
he's having with it - I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that 
there's a fault with the car's bluetooth connectivity that causes the car not to have 
been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that the car wasn't of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H and I find that it wouldn't be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Land Rover Financial Services 
to allow him the reject the car, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
Mr H has also complained about the way that Land Rover Financial Services has dealt with 
the deposit that he paid for the car but, having looked at the hire purchase agreement and 
the invoice, I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that it dealt with his 
deposit incorrectly. The price of the car was £24,739 and the amount of credit that was 
provided to him was £24,718 (a difference of £21) and he part exchanged a car which was 
given a value of £15,900 but on which there was outstanding finance of £16,876.11 - so the 
payment of £1,000 that he made was used to settle the finance and £21 of it was used as 
the deposit shown on the hire purchase agreement.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
