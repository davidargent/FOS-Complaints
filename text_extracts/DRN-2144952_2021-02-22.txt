The complaint
Mr E complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality and that 
the car has been repossessed.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr E under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that he electronically signed in May 2019;
he complained to the dealer about some issues with the car and it provided him with 
a replacement gearbox for him to install - but there continued to be issues with the 
car and the car needed a new fly wheel so Mr E complained to MotoNovo Finance in 
June 2019;
MotoNovo, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr E - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr E was more than five years old, had been driven for 
62,000 miles and had a price of £8,190;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
MotoNovo Finance upheld Mr Es complaint and paid him £478.44 to reimburse him 
for the cost of the required parts and paid him £50 for the distress and inconvenience 
that hed been caused  it agreed the Mr E could repair the car and said that the 
dealer had provided evidence to show that the car was sold with a full service history;
it also said in August 2019 that, if Mr E could provide receipts for the costs that hes 
incurred when he was without the car, it would consider reimbursement of those 
costs;
I consider that MotoNovo Finances response to his complaint was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr E 
provided it with any further receipts or any evidence to show that there were further 
issues with the car  and its system notes show that he said that he was cancelling 
his direct debit and wouldnt be making the monthly payments under the agreement;
there were further discussions about the complaint between August and October 
2019 but Mr E made no payment for the car after August 2019 and MotoNovo 
Finance had explained the consequences of non-payment to him;
MotoNovo Finance terminated the agreement, the car was repossessed from Mr E in 
January 2020 (and it says that the cars engine was partially dismantled with many 
component parts missing and that many parts of the interior trim were missing  but 
Mr E says that they were in the cars boot)  the car was then sold at auction and the 
proceeds of sale were applied to Mr Es account, leaving an outstanding balance of 
£8,009.78; 
I sympathise with Mr E for the issues that hes had with the car  and with the 
financial and other difficulties that hes described  but he stopped making the 
payments that were required under the agreement, I consider that he was made 
aware of the consequences of that and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that MotoNovo Finance acted incorrectly when it terminated the 
agreement and repossessed the car;
the issues that Mr E had with the car didnt entitle him not to make the required 
monthly payments under the agreement and MotoNovo Finance had reimbursed him 
for the cost of some parts and had paid him £50 compensation;
he accepted that compensation for the issues with the gearbox and MotoNovo 
Finance agreed that he could repair the car, but he says that he then found further 
issues with the car  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
those issues were present when the car was supplied to him or that he had the right 
to reject the car because of any of those issues  and because the car was then 
repossessed and sold no further investigation of those issues is possible;
the car has been sold so cant be returned to Mr E and Im not persuaded that it 
would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require MotoNovo 
Finance to reimburse him for any further costs, to pay him any other compensation, 
to reduce (or waive) the outstanding balance of his account, or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint; and
I suggest that Mr E contacts MotoNovo Finance to try to agree and affordable 
repayment arrangement for him to repay the outstanding balance of his account  
MotoNovo Finance is required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes 
experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Es complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2021.
