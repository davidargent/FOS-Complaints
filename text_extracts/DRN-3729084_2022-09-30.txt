The complaint
B complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) restricted its account several times 
causing it financial loss. 
What happened
PayPal restricted Bs account several times in February 2021 and March 2021. One of Bs 
directors say they spent substantive time in contacting PayPal to sort this out but were given 
less than adequate answers. 
B add the intermittent blocks on the account caused it to lose income. B complained about 
this. PayPal did not uphold the complaint and the matter was referred to this service.
 
One of our Investigators looked into Bs complaint. In summary, they found that in restricting 
Bs account, and thereby blocking it, PayPal was fairly complying with legal and regulatory 
obligations it has to follow. 
They also said PayPal does not need to explain its reasons for doing so, and that it acted 
without delay when carrying out its reviews. PayPal did however make an error when saying 
there was a glitch in its system. Because of this they felt its offer of £50 compensation was 
enough for any inconvenience caused. 
B did not agree with what our Investigator said. It felt compensation should be in the 
thousands of pounds given its financial losses - especially as PayPal had no grounds for 
taking the actions it did. 
As B didnt agree, the complaint has now been passed to me  an Ombudsman  to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to uphold Bs complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Financial businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means regulated firms need 
to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Ive closely reviewed PayPals terms - which includes its Acceptable Use Policy. Given the 
legal and regulatory obligations placed on PayPal, and what its terms say, Im satisfied it 
acted fairly when deciding to review and then restrict Bs account. Its unfortunate the 
restrictions placed on Bs account were intermittent, and over a couple of months. But Ive 
looked closely at the reasons PayPal applied each restriction and having done that Im 
satisfied it acted fairly on each occasion. 
I note B feels PayPal had no reasonable basis to take the actions it did. Neither PayPal nor I 
are under any obligation that Im aware of to disclose the reasons. I appreciate B will find this 
inadequate. But, as Ive already said, Im satisfied PayPal had reason and concern enough 
to place the restrictions as it did. 
Im also satisfied each review was carried out without undue delay. But its clear some of the 
advice given to B on phone calls was erroneous and unhelpful. I think £50 is fair 
compensation for this  especially as PayPal did nothing wrong in carrying out the reviews 
and the speed in which they were carried out. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint in part. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
should put things right as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
