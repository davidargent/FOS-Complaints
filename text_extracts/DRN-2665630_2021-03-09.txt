The complaint
Ms G has complained that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) provided her with a credit 
card when they shouldnt have done. She believes that her financial position wasnt strong 
enough to support the debt and that NewDays decision to lend to her was irresponsible.
What happened
Ms G applied for an Aqua credit card with NewDay in January 2018. Based upon the 
information in her application, a card was agreed with an initial limit of £450.
Ms G made her first monthly repayments on time and the amounts paid were for more than 
the minimum required under the agreement. But, by the middle of 2018, Ms G began to 
make payments later than the due date. Because of this, NewDay applied late payment fees.
NewDay sent letters to Ms G in May and June 2018 to highlight the late and missed 
payments. These letters also said that they had stopped her using her card until the situation 
was put right. Ms G called NewDay the day after the date of the June letter. 
During the call, Ms G explained that she had not received her wages. NewDay recorded this 
as a temporary issue. NewDay suggested that she set up a direct debit so that she did not 
miss future payments and save on any charges. Ms G declined because her wages were 
paid weekly. Ms G had already made a payment of £25 and told NewDay that she had now 
made a further payment of £20.
Ms Gs card balance was over the limit agreed of £450 because of the late payment 
charges. This meant that a further fee was charged. NewDay sent another letter to Ms G in 
July 2018 about the charges.
Ms G made no further payments to reduce the balance after those made in June 2018. So, 
NewDay wrote to Ms G again in August 2018. As they hadnt received a reply, NewDay 
suspended Ms Gs account. She was told about this on her September 2018 statement. At 
the same time, NewDay sent a Notice of Sums in Arrears and included with this an 
Information Sheet produced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with advice and 
guidance.
Another statement was sent to Ms G in October which showed further interest and charges 
in line with the card agreement. There is no record that Ms G contacted NewDay after any of 
these letters had been sent. So, NewDay made the decision to stop further charges and 
transferred management of the outstanding debt to a debt collection agency in October 
2018.
Ms G contacted NewDay in January 2020 with her complaint. NewDay didnt agree that they 
had acted irresponsibly when agreeing to give Ms G an account and card. Ms G was 
unhappy with this outcome so decided to refer her complaint to this service.
 
The complaint has been looked at by one of our investigators. She did not agree that 
NewDay had been irresponsible in agreeing to lend to Ms G. But she did think that NewDay 
should have acted sooner to provide support to Ms G. She thought that NewDay should 
have taken further steps to understand Ms Gs circumstances following her call in June 
2018. Because of this, our investigator thought that NewDay had not acted fairly. She said 
that NewDay should refund the interest and charges applied following Ms Gs phone call to 
them in June 2018.
NewDay did not accept our investigators view so asked for the complaint to be passed to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I issued a 
provisional decision on 4 February 2021. I explained why I thought that NewDay didnt need 
to do anything more here.
Neither Ms G or Newday have provided any further information or evidence following my 
provisional decision, so the case has been passed to me to reach a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think there are two clear parts to this complaint for me to consider:
Was NewDays decision to provide Ms G with a credit card account and the agreed 
limit reasonable and responsible based upon the information that they had?
Was NewDays response to Ms Gs financial difficulties appropriate? 
I have looked at the application information that Ms G provided to NewDay when she first 
applied for her card in January 2018. 
Ms Gs application says that she was employed and receiving an income at a level that 
would support borrowing at the level agreed. NewDay also completed some checks with 
credit reference agencies. This is normal for this kind of application. Although this showed 
that Ms G had defaults previously, there was no evidence to suggest that Ms G had any bad 
debt or default history for a period of 18 months before her application.
 
NewDay have said that this falls within their policy as a second chance lender that offers 
lending to people who have been rejected by other high street lenders. NewDay is entitled 
to decide who they lend to and, if they want to accept the risk of lending to people that other 
business may not lend to, they are free to decide that. But that doesnt mean that they dont 
have the same obligations as other lenders to perform borrower focused assessments that 
any lending they provide is affordable and sustainable.
Here NewDay have explained that the application was accepted with a low initial limit. This 
would allow Ms G to build a track record with them before they would consider increasing 
this further. The relatively small level of borrowing NewDay made available to Ms G means 
that I think that the checks they did  including taking the information Ms G provided in good 
faith and double-checking credit reference information  were proportionate here. It is also 
clear that at no time did NewDay increase the limit available to Ms G. So, I agree with our 
investigator and dont believe that NewDay were acting irresponsibly when they agreed to 
lend to Ms G.
 
So then Ive looked at how NewDay have treated Ms Gs financial difficulties. During the first 
month that she used the card, a large proportion of the available limit was used. Ms G then 
repaid a large proportion of this amount owed at least a week before the due payment date. The following month, Ms G exceeded the limit available to her. As a result, a charge was 
made and NewDay also sent a letter so that this was clear to her. Ms G made a payment, on 
time, which exceeded the minimum required. She continued to use the card until her late 
payments in May and June. On each occasion, NewDay wrote to Ms G to explain the 
charges and provide contact details.
In June 2018, Ms G called NewDay to discuss the situation. NewDay have provided their 
notes from that conversation. It appears that Ms G told them that she had not received her 
wages yet and that this had led to her late payment. There is no evidence to suggest that Ms 
G had any other wider financial problems at that time. If this had been the case, Ms G had 
an opportunity to tell NewDay at this point. NewDay also suggested that Ms G could set up a 
direct debit for her monthly payments. I think this was a sensible suggestion as this would 
help her to avoid further late payment fees. Ms G didnt want this because she was paid 
weekly. I can see nothing from the information available to NewDay that would suggest that 
there was a more serious underlying problem. I believe that they acted upon the information 
provided to them from Ms G and did so in a positive, proportionate way.
Ms G made no further payments to her card account from July onwards. So, NewDay wrote 
to her again clearly explaining the situation and providing guidance, in case Ms G could not 
pay. They wrote to her on two occasions. Ms G didnt reply so NewDay suspended her 
account at the beginning of September and sent notices of arrears. They also included an 
information sheet from the FCA. This provided clear advice on what to do if you receive an 
arrears notice. It also provided details of where Ms G could get help and advice from. I think 
this was the right thing to do. Particularly if Ms G was having wider financial difficulties with 
other lenders and didnt know what to do next. That is what Id expect to see a lender do in a 
situation like this.
Unfortunately, there is no record that Ms G contacted NewDay, despite the letters, 
statements and advice that NewDay had sent. As a result, NewDay made the decision to 
stop applying interest and charges in October 2018 and transferred management of Ms Gs 
account to a debt collection agency. I think this was a fair thing to do as although it will have 
had a severe impact on Ms Gs credit file, transferring a debt in this way will often result in 
the interest and charges being suspended  allowing a borrower to pay off what they owe, 
without this increasing further.
In reaching my decision, I need to be fair to both parties. I think that NewDay took 
appropriate actions based upon the information given to them. When Ms G contacted 
NewDay they discussed the situation with her in a helpful way. But what she told them 
meant that they thought the problem was only a temporary one. But after June 2018, Ms G 
didnt get in touch with NewDay again and so, in the absence of payments, all they could do 
was to take further action to try and recover the debt in the way they did. I dont think they 
did so unfairly in the circumstances.
Ms G has not specifically complained about the way that NewDay have handled the default.  
Because of this and in the absence of any further evidence, I think that NewDay acted in a 
timely, fair way here and I dont think they needed to do anything different or sooner here.
 
Neither Ms G or NewDay have provided any new information or evidence following my 
provisional decision of 4 February 2021. That means that I have no reason to depart from 
the findings I reached in this. So, my decision remains the same.My final decision
As set out above, I am not upholding Ms Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2021.
