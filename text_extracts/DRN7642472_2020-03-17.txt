K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains that MoneyGram International Limited wouldnt process a transaction he 
wanted to make to third parties abroad. 
Background 
Since 2012 Mr S has been sending weekly payments to his daughters who live overseas.  
On 11 December 2018, Mr S tried to send Â£130  to his daughter. Mr S explained that this was 
something hed been  doing  each week to help support  his daughters.  And hes explained  
that the transactions are not of a high amount. MoneyGram rejected the payment. And it 
returned the payment to Mr S. MoneyGram also told Mr S it wouldnt allow  further payments 
to be made  by him though  its services.  
Mr S says he hasnt done anything wrong and cant understand  MoneyGrams actions. He 
wants an explanation  for why his payment was rejected. And he wants to be able to continue  
to send money to his daughters using  MoneyGram. 
MoneyGram says that all its transactions are put through routine monitoring and security 
checks. And in order to protect its customers it actively reviews  transaction amounts and 
frequencies and will, from time to time, put restrictions in place to safeguard its consumers. If 
it doesnt feel comfortable with the send or receive activity, or with the purpose of the 
transaction, the service could be declined. And said its actions  were  in accordance with the 
terms and conditions. MoneyGram also explained  that it was concerned Mr S had been the 
victim of a scam or fraud  regarding the payment he wanted to make.  And  hed suffer a 
financial loss. So, it blocked the payment.
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Ss complaint. She said MoneyGram  hadnt  done 
anything wrong  and had acted in accordance  with the terms and conditions. The investigator 
also said that MoneyGram didnt have to provide Mr S with an explanation  and had the right 
to choose who it decided to do business  with. Mr S disagreed.  He says MoneyGram hasnt 
treated him fairly. And seem to be rejecting peoples payments randomly. As no agreement 
could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr S feels very strongly about  whats happened here. Thats clear from whats  hes 
said to us and to MoneyGram. Whilst I appreciate  Mr Ss frustration,  its important to point 
out that the only thing in question here is whether MoneyGram has done  what it should have 
done. And I think it has. Ill explain why.
Mr S says he hasnt done anything wrong and he hasnt been  the victim of a scam. That may 
well be the case.  But a business-like  MoneyGram has to have in place security measures 
and procedures in order to try to prevent  fraud and safeguard its customers  accounts.  And 
its not for this service to interfere with these processes. Thats a matter for MoneyGram.
There is a balance to be achieved between MoneyGram assisting individuals  who contact  it 
to make payments  and it providing protection from fraud. Having put a fraud detection  
Ref: DRN76424722system in place, when  it flags up a transaction as potentially suspicious, its not 
unreasonable for MoneyGram to act on that.
Mr S says MoneyGram hasnt  fully explained why it wouldnt  process his payment.  
And I can understand that hes frustrated that he hasnt been  given a proper explanation.
But MoneyGram doesnt have to provide this information to him. So, I cant say it did 
anything wrong  by not giving this to him. 
Mr S has said hed been making  the same payments for some time which  he says shows it 
they were legitimate. But the fact that none of his previous transactions  hadnt been  picked  
up by MoneyGrams security systems doesnt  mean it was wrong to highlight the December 
payment. Its for MoneyGram to decide  what factors their system should look at when 
reviewing transactions.  And I havent  seen  anything which suggests it was used unfairly  or 
incorrectly here. So, I cant  say MoneyGram  did anything wrong when it declined to process  
Mr Ss payments on 12 December 2018.
I appreciate that MoneyGrams decision to no longer offer Mr S its services  in the future has 
caused him inconvenience. But MoneyGram can make commercial decisions about  who it 
wants to offer its services  to. They cannot unfairly  discriminate  against a customer. But they 
can say they no longer  wish to do business  with individuals.  Thats because theyve got the 
commercial freedom to decide who they want to contract with. And Im satisfied  that 
MoneyGram has exercised its commercial  decision legitimately  when  it decided  to no longer 
do business with Mr S. So, I cannot  fairly  and reasonably  say its done anything wrong.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 April 2020.
