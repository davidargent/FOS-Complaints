K821x#15complaint
Miss P says Active Securities Limited,  trading as 247Moneybox, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss P had three loans with 247Moneybox. Ive set out some of the information 
247Moneybox provided about these loans in the table below.
Loan  no. Loan  Amount Interest Start date End date
1 £120 £30 10/09/2010 04/10/2010
2 £160 £48 11/10/2010 02/11/2010
3 £200 £60 12/11/2010 16/03/2015
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. He thought 
247Moneybox was wrong to have approved loan 3. 247Moneybox  didnt respond  to the 
adjudicators opinion, so the complaint has been passed to me. 
As theres  been  no ongoing dispute  about loans 1 and 2, Ill only look at loan 3 in my 
decision. Loans 1 and 2 remain  relevant  in as far as they form part of the lending  history.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Throughout the period of lending, the regulator  was the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT). The 
OFT had published guidance  on irresponsible lending (ILG) in March 2010.  
The ILG made it clear lenders have a duty to lend responsibly  this includes undertaking 
proportionate affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans sustainably. The 
definition of a sustainable repayment includes  that payments should be made from income  
and/or savings, without  undue  difficulty and while meeting other reasonable commitments.  
Theres no prescriptive list of the sort of checks a lender should carry out, but the guidance 
says lenders may wish to take into account  factors such  as the type of credit,  a customers  
credit history  and their existing  financial commitments.
With this in mind, Ive considered whether 247Moneybox carried out proportionate checks  for 
loan 3 and, if it didnt, what I think such checks are likely to have shown.
247Moneybox says Miss P declared  her net pay was £1,500  (I assume monthly)  and that 
she had no other high-cost short-term credit at the time she applied  for her loans. It says it 
also carried out credit checks and verified that Miss P was employed.
Ref: DRN48179232Although I think its likely 247Moneybox did carry out checks like these, it hasnt provided 
any supporting evidence for what it says Miss P declared, or of the credit checks it said it 
carried out. Given the time thats  passed,  Ive not read anything  negative into this. But it 
does mean  Ive had to use the information  available to me  including  Miss Ps bank  
statements  to help me decide what proportionate checks  would likely have shown.
In Miss Ps circumstances, I think  it wouldve  been proportionate for 247Moneybox  to ask 
about her income  and general expenditure  as well as asking for information about her 
regular and short-term  credit commitments. Checking Miss Ps short-term credit  
commitments was, in my view, particularly  important as Miss P was asking for her third loan 
in just three months, with only short gaps between the loans and for an increased amount 
each time.  This pattern  of borrowing  can arise where a borrower  is having  difficulty  repaying 
their loans sustainably.  
Our adjudicator thought that Miss Ps monthly income at the time was around £1,400 and 
her monthly expenditure (which included £540 of short-term credit repayments) was around 
£1,150. Based on these figures, our adjudicator through Miss Ps disposable income at the 
time of loan 3 was £250 a month  less than the repayment on loan 3.
Ive independently reviewed these figures  and if anything I think  its possible Miss Ps short-
term credit  commitments  were greater than £540 in December 2010.  Miss P made  payments 
to around nine other lenders in this month,  paying out more than £1,000. 
I cant be sure, from Miss Ps bank statements, that all of the above  debts existed on or prior 
to the date loan 3 was approved. But from the evidence Ive seen, I think its likely most of 
them did  and so 247Moneybox couldve found out about them by asking Miss P to set out 
the detail of her short-term commitments and/or checking this with a credit  reference agency. 
So had 247Moneybox  carried out proportionate checks, I think it wouldve seen that Miss Ps 
short-term commitments  were at least £540 at the time of loan 3. So, combined with her 
existing commitments, she didnt have enough  disposable income to sustainably  repay 
loan 3.
In summary,  I think proportionate checks wouldve  shown 247Moneybox that Miss Ps 
current monthly expenditure was just short of, or already exceed, her monthly  income and 
that loan 3 wasnt sustainably affordable for her. Im therefore upholding her complaint about 
this loan.
putting things right
247Moneybox must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss P paid on loan 3
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Miss P paid them  (if she 
did) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loan 3 from Miss Ps credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 247Moneybox must  
give Miss P a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
Ref: DRN48179233my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. Active Securities  Limited must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 April 2019.
