The complaint
Ms R complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for some 
holiday club membership points rights. Her husband is also involved in her complaint and 
shes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Ms R and her husband entered into a series of purchase agreements to buy holiday 
products from a holiday company between August 2011 and January 2013, including a 
purchase of 20,000 membership points rights in March 2012 and a purchase of 2,000 
membership points rights in about November 2012. The total price payable for the March 
2012 purchase was £10,000 and Ms R used her MBNA credit card to pay £2,000 of that 
amount, with the payment being charged to her credit card account in April 2012. I 
understand that the balance of £8,000 was paid by other means. The total price payable for 
the November 2012 purchase was £4,500 and Ms R used her MBNA credit card to pay all of 
that amount, with the payment being charged to her credit card account later that month. 
Ms Rs representative, on behalf of Ms R, made a claim to MBNA in July 2017 under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. MBNA said that it was of the view that there was no 
debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in relation to Ms Rs contracts with the holiday company 
because the merchant that debited her account wasnt the holiday company so she didnt 
have a valid section 75 claim. Claims were also made to other providers of the finance that 
Ms R and her husband had used to pay for their purchases  and those claims are being 
dealt with separately.
MBNA then said in a final response letter that was sent to Ms Rs representative in February 
2018 that it considered that the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship was broken so it had no 
liability under section 75. Ms R wasnt satisfied with MBNAs response so a complaint was 
made to this service that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Ms R and her husband and breaching the EU Timeshare 
Directive. Ms Rs complaint form said that the transaction that she was complaining about 
took place in August 2011.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Ms Rs complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that MBNAs decision to turn down Ms Rs claim was unfair or unreasonable. She said 
that the claim letter refers only to a fractional points membership and not the membership 
points rights that Ms R and her husband had bought in March and November 2012 and for 
which Ms R had made payments using her MBNA credit card. She didnt think that MBNA 
had a claim to answer and she didnt think that MBNA did anything wrong by declining 
Ms Rs claim. 
Ms Rs representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses. As Ms R hasnt accepted our 
investigators recommendation, Ive been asked to issue a decision on this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Ms Rs complaint shouldnt be but upheld 
for these reasons:
Ms Rs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Ms Rs complaint form says the holiday company was in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Ms R and her husband and breaching the EU 
Timeshare Directive and Ms Rs complaint form says that the transaction that shes 
complaining about took place in August 2011;
Im not determining the outcome of Ms R claim under section 75 in this decision as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not MBNAs 
response to her claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Ms R and her husband entered into a purchase agreement in August 2011 to buy 
6,000 membership points rights from the holiday company for a total price of £6,500 
but Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms R used her MBNA credit card to pay any 
part of the price payable so I dont consider that Ms R is able to make a section 75 
claim to MBNA about that purchase;
Ms R did use her MBNA credit card to make payments relating to the purchases that 
she and her husband made in March and November 2012 but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that the membership points rights that they bought at those times were 
misrepresented to them, that theres been a breach of contract relating to those 
purchases or that theres been a breach of the EU Timeshare Directive for which 
MBNA would be liable under section 75;
our investigator said that Ms Rs representatives claim letter refers only to a 
fractional points membership and not the membership points rights that Ms R and 
her husband had bought in March and November 2012 but the only information that 
Ms Rs representative has provided in response to our investigators 
recommendation is a generic submission from a legal counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses;
MBNA said in September 2017 in response to the claims that had been made to it 
that it was of the view that that there was no debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in 
relation to Ms Rs contracts with the holiday company because the merchant that 
debited her account wasnt the holiday company so she didnt have a valid section 75 
claim  and it said in its final response letter that it considered that the debtor-
creditor-supplier relationship was broken so it had no liability under section 75;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement but, as Ms Rs credit card statements show that the payments of 
£2,000 and £4,500 that she made using her MBNA credit card were made to a 
trustee, and not to the holiday company (even though the holiday company is also 
referred to on the statements), its now possible that there was no such agreement in 
place following the High Courts judgment last year in the case of Steiner v National 
Westminster Bank plc;
but as Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or a breach of 
contract for which MBNA would be liable under section 75, I consider that theres no need for me to make any finding as to whether or not there were debtor-creditor-
supplier agreements in these arrangements;
I sympathise with Ms R and her husband for the issues that theyve had with the 
holiday products that they bought from the holiday company, but I consider that 
MBNAs response to the claims that had been made to it was fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MBNA to refund to Ms R 
any of the money that she paid for the membership points rights that she and her 
husband bought from the holiday company in March and November 2012, to refund 
to her any of the money that shes paid for any other holiday products, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
