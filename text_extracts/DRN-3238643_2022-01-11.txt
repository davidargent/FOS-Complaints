The complaint
Miss R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) were contacting her on 
outdated information about an outstanding balance on a loan she had with them.
What happened
Miss R took out a business loan with NatWest in 2015 for a business she ran as a sole 
trader. Miss R fell into arrears on her loan and was contacted by NatWest to discuss her 
repayment options.
In December 2019, an income and expenditure assessment was completed by Miss R and 
she was given time to consider her options in repaying back the loan amount in line with an 
affordability plan. During this time, NatWest and Miss R communicated with each other by 
phone and email. In February 2020, NatWest say a loan repayment agreement was reached 
in which Miss R had to pay the sum of around Â£205 a month for six months. Over the six 
months, if Miss R cleared her arrears, then she would be allowed to continue with making 
loan repayments to repay the outstanding amount owed. Confirmation of the plan was sent 
by NatWest to Miss R in the post.
In August 2020, following the completion of Miss Rs affordability plan, NatWest say they 
contacted Miss R on several occasions on a number they had on file for her. They say they 
contacted Miss R by phone and text message but didnt receive a response. The phone 
number NatWest used was different to the number they previously contacted Miss R on 
when discussing the affordability plan.
NatWest also sent letters to Miss R by post. In September 2020, NatWest issued a Default 
Notice on her loan account and a Formal Demand Notice was issued to Miss R in October 
2020. Her account with NatWest was then transferred to their recoveries department in 
November 2020 as they hadnt heard from Miss R.
Miss R later contacted NatWest after receiving a letter from a collection agency informing 
her that they would be managing the loan going forward. She says they told her they tried to 
contact her several times once the affordability plan had ended to discuss the ongoing 
repayments of her outstanding loan amount. She says they contacted her on an outdated 
address and a phone number she no longer uses. Miss R says she told NatWest during the 
time her affordability plan was being discussed that her business had closed and confirmed 
her new contact details. She also says she regularly received communication from NatWest 
on her new number she provided.
NatWest say Miss R didnt notify them of a change of business address, but only provided 
her personal address for security and verification purposes when she contacted them. They 
say a change of business address cant be completed over the phone. So, all written 
communication continued to be sent to her business address. They did however notice that 
they hadnt updated their records for the correct telephone number to reach her on and 
apologised for their mistake.
Miss R, unhappy with NatWests response, brought her complaint to our service. She says 
that NatWest regularly contacted her on her personal number she provided when discussing 
the affordability plan, so believes NatWest should have also been able to contact her on that 
number when they tried to chase her for continued repayments.
Our investigator said that he couldnt fairly say NatWest got something wrong. He said 
NatWest made it clear to Miss R what her obligations were if she cleared her arrears at the 
end of the affordability plan. He agreed that NatWest should have updated Miss Rs phone 
number and contacted her on the correct number. But he said NatWest did also write out to 
Miss R to the address they had on file. So, he felt NatWest still took reasonable steps to 
make Miss R aware of the position of her account and to try and discuss options with her. 
Miss R disagreed with our investigators findings as she believes she updated NatWest with 
her parents address for correspondence to be sent to and there was no indication that 
anything would be sent to her outdated address. She also says that she explained to her 
account manager at NatWest on several occasions that the best way to contact her was by 
phone and email. So, the complaint was passed to me to look at.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
Miss R has asked for clarity on why she needed to have the loan transferred to her personal 
account when it was a business loan initially. She believes the loan was taken out by a 
limited company she held.
However, from the loan agreement, I can see Miss R took out this business loan with 
NatWest as a sole trader, and not by a limited company. So, while her business no longer 
brings in an income, she is still liable for the outstanding balance owed.
Miss R says that letters sent to her about her business loan were sent to an outdated 
address. NatWest say they sent letters to the address they had on file for the business. 
Since February 2020, NatWest say they sent Miss R confirmation of her affordability plan by 
post, as well as further chasers for repayment of her loan once her affordability plan had 
ended. 
NatWest say their process for address changes are to visit a local branch with certain 
required documentation. They have provided me a file note dated 16 October 2019 where I 
can see they called Miss R to discuss her loan. The note says that the Customers address 
is wrong. I tried to update but unable to. Customer to go to branch. So, it is possible 
NatWest told Miss R that she needed to visit a branch to change her address, but I cant be 
sure of this as the note isnt very clear whether Miss R opted to visit a branch to change 
address or whether she was told she needed to.
I can also see from file notes NatWest provided that Miss R made them aware her business 
was no longer trading.
In late 2019 and early 2020, Miss R was having ongoing conversations with NatWest around 
putting in place an affordability plan, due to falling into arrears on her business loan. During 
these conversations I can see that in December 2019, NatWest sent a letter to Miss Rs 
parents address, as requested. NatWest also say Miss R gave her parents address for 
verification purposes when discussing matters regarding her liability on her business loan.
In these circumstances, I think it would have been reasonable to expect NatWest to question 
the relevancy of the address they had on file for the business as they were told it was no 
longer trading and Miss R provided her parents address for correspondence to be sent and 
for verification purposes. I also noted that from Miss Rs request, NatWest were able to send correspondence to a different address they had on file, without her needing to go into a 
branch to change her address. 
In February 2020, NatWest and Miss R agreed and put in place an affordability plan, 
sometimes called an arrangement to pay, for six months. Their communication with each 
other was mainly by phone and email, which Miss R says she also told NatWest was the 
best way to contact her. NatWest confirmed details of the plan by post but reverted back to 
sending confirmation to the outdated address they had on file. They then continued to use 
this outdated address going forward. 
I appreciate NatWests comments that they are not obliged to communicate with Miss R by 
email and phone only and that it is part of their process to have a registered address for the 
business to correspond to Miss R on. I also appreciate NatWests comments that it is Miss 
Rs responsibility to ensure her contact details were up to date.
But considering the affordability plan had been agreed with NatWest over the phone and 
email, I dont think it would have been on Miss Rs mind to wait for confirmation to arrive in 
the post. Letters were also sent to her parents address on request a couple of months 
before and the payments began when instructed. So I think its unlikely Miss R gave it much 
thought that a confirmation letter didnt arrive to the address she expected it to arrive at.
I can also see from August 2020, once the affordability plan had ended, NatWest began to 
chase Miss R on a phone number she no longer used. This number was different to the one 
she was in regular contact with NatWest on when setting up her plan. NatWest has 
acknowledged they did contact Miss R on an outdated phone number and apologised for 
this. I also noted that before August 2020, NatWest often tried different numbers they had for 
Miss R on file if they didnt receive a response on the first number they dialled. From August 
2020, they didnt do this and only tried to contact Miss R by phone on the incorrect, outdated 
number.
Had NatWest contacted Miss R on the correct number, I think its likely she would have 
responded to them. I say this, because from what I have seen, Miss R got back in touch with 
NatWest when they have requested to be contacted previously. So I think its likely she 
would have continued to do so.
NatWest say that at the end of the affordability plan they would have offered Miss R a loan to 
cover her outstanding debt with them. They say the affordability plan was to ensure Miss R 
could meet her contractual obligations on a new loan, and so the new loan would be 
calculated on the repayment amounts she was already making.
But as a result of NatWest calling and messaging the wrong number, as well as sending 
letters to an address no longer in use, NatWest passed the management of Miss Rs loan to 
a debt recovery company. This has also meant there is now a default appearing on her 
credit file.
Miss R has told us she cried a lot over this issue, and it caused her a lot of emotional stress 
and inconvenience. She has also told us the stress has impacted her health. So, while Miss 
R may still be liable for the outstanding loan balance, I think she should be awarded 
compensation for the poor service shes received and for the distress this has caused her.
I set out what I intended to instruct NatWest to do to put things right. And I gave both parties 
the opportunity to send me any further information or comments they wanted me to consider 
before I issued my final decision.
Responses to the provisional decisionNatWest didnt respond. Miss R did and feels the Â£250 I thought NatWest should pay as 
compensation was too low.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The only comment on the provisional decision was from Miss R. She feels due to the amount 
of time she has had to spend complaining about this situation, she deserves a higher 
amount of compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
I am also mindful of what Miss R has previously told our service on the impact this issue has 
had on her. But I cant fairly say that NatWests mistake should lead to a higher amount of 
compensation in this instance.
I accept it would have come as a shock to Miss R to be contacted by a debt recovery 
company directly, without receiving communication from NatWest first, as what should have 
happened. And I can see why Miss R complained to NatWest.
But as Ive said, Miss R is still liable for the outstanding balance owed. I can see from 
NatWests file notes that they had explained to Miss R her liability to repay the outstanding 
balance. So, Im satisfied Miss R ought to have been reasonably aware that she still owed 
money to NatWest after her affordability plan had ended.
I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest to pay more for distress and inconvenience, 
considering Miss R ought to have been reasonably aware she would need to make 
repayments for her outstanding debt.
Considering all the circumstances, I think Â£250 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused is fair, given NatWests mistake of not contacting Miss R as they 
should have.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
1. Arrange for the management of the loan to be transferred from the debt recovery 
company back to them.
2. Get in touch with Miss R to arrange a suitable repayment loan in line with what 
repayment amounts she was already making. I understand Miss R has already 
begun to make repayments to the debt recovery company. If so, any loan to pay off 
the outstanding balance should take this into consideration.
3. Remove any adverse information that was applied to Miss Rs credit file after the 
arrangement ended in August 2020. 
4. Pay Miss R Â£250 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
