Our adjudicator said that he hadnt seen  enough  evidence to say that QuickQuid acted 
unfairly in giving Mr P loans one to four. But he though that it shouldnt have given Mr P 
loans five to nine. The adjudicator set out what QuickQuid should do to put matters right. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator. As there  was no agreement  between the 
parties, the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN31764422the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Mr P loans one to four. For loans one and 
two, it appeared  that Mr P could afford to repay those loans. For loans three and four, Mr P 
hasnt given us further information about  his financial position at that time. So, I cant  say 
whether further  checks would have shown that Mr P couldnt afford to repay loans  three and 
four. Based on what Ive seen, I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to give him those loans. 
But looking  at the overall pattern of Mr Ps lending history with QuickQuid, I think  that by loan 
five QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. QuickQuid should have  realised that it shouldnt  provide loan five 
onwards. I say this because:
By loan five, Mr Ps overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr P had taken five loans in seven and a half 
months. The amounts  he was borrowing  increased  for the rest of the borrowing 
relationship with QuickQuid. In my view, the pattern of lending itself shows  that the 
loans from and including loan five were unsustainable. So, I dont think QuickQuid 
should have given Mr P loans five to nine.  
QuickQuid allowed Mr P to refinance  loan five and, later in his borrowing, Mr P was 
provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one. So 
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr P was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN31764423Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  Loan  nine  
was taken out over 16 months  after Mr Ps first loan. And it was for a much  greater   
amount. Mr P had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan five  
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans five to nine and QuickQuid should put 
things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans five to nine;
reduce the refund  by the amount of any capital outstanding in relation to loan nine 
and pay any remaining balance to Mr P;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan five onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans five to nine should be removed 
from Mr Ps credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ps complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC, 
trading as QuickQuid,  should pay Mr P compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.
