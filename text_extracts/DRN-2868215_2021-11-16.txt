The complaint
Mr W complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly presented a bankers 
draft to the wrong bank and then destroyed it. 
What happened
Mr W says he deposited a bankers draft from an Australian Bank into his bank account with 
NatWest for the sum of £500. Mr W says he then heard from NatWest informing him the 
draft had been unpaid by the clearing bank as it was wrongly delivered. Mr W says NatWest 
debited his account with the £500 and told him the draft had been destroyed and there is 
nothing further they could do. Mr W feels NatWest are at fault as they presented the draft to 
the incorrect bank and shouldnt have destroyed it, as this has meant he is now out of pocket 
for £500 as a result of their actions. Mr W wants NatWest to contact the Australian bank to 
get the funds paid into his bank account and compensate him for the trouble and upset this 
has caused him.
NatWest have said the draft hasnt been lost, its simply the Australian bank no longer banks 
where it did at the time the draft was issued over nine years ago. NatWest says they no 
longer keep original cheques or drafts when they are processed through the clearing system, 
in line with standard banking practice. NatWest says they have acted correctly here.
Mr W wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the information available but didnt uphold the complaint. 
Although he felt NatWest had presented the draft to the incorrect bank this had no impact on 
whether it would  have been paid or not as the details on the bankers draft were no longer 
valid. The investigator didnt feel it was this service role to tell NatWest how their process of 
clearing cheques should work.
Mr W wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating for Mr W to discover the bankers draft he 
deposited into his bank account, was returned unpaid and destroyed by NatWest, meaning 
that he has now lost the £500 sent to him by his brother. 
The first thing to say here, when coming to a full and impartial decision, is the bankers draft 
was over nine years old when it was deposited into Mr Ws bank account and this has 
contributed to the problems Mr W has faced, given the time that has passed. 
Its also worth mentioning that there has been some misunderstanding here from Mr W and 
in part it is understandable, given that he was told in an advice of unpaid cheque letter dated 
27 November 2019, the bankers draft he had deposited had been wrongly delivered. 
Although NatWest did go on to try and explain what had happened in their final response to 
Mr W in January 2020, I can understand that he may have believed NatWest had sent the 
bankers draft for payment to the wrong bank through the clearing system. In fact, what 
happened here was NatWest presented the bankers draft to the correct bank details, 
however, that bank account had been closed since the bankers draft was originally issued in 
2010. Its worth explaining, the overseas bank who initially issued the bankers draft, issued it 
on their UK bank account, however by the time the bankers draft had been presented for 
payment some nine years later, they had closed their bank account with that bank in the UK. 
This is why the bankers draft was returned unpaid. So, with that in mind I cant say NatWest 
acted incorrectly when the payment was reversed from Mr Ws bank account. 
I understand that Mr W was also unhappy that the bankers draft was destroyed, which no 
doubt would have added to the frustration he felt, but as the investigator has explained, this 
forms part of the clearing process banks like NatWest now adopt, since the introduction of 
the image cheque clearance process. So, while I can understand how frustrating this would 
have been for Mr W, NatWest have acted in line with their and other banks clearing process 
here, and its not my role to tell them they must change this. 
As I mentioned before, the gap of over nine years has contributed to the issues here and 
although NatWest could have been clearer when the bankers draft was first returned unpaid, 
I cant say they have made any errors and it would be unfair of me to punish them for a badly 
communicated advice letter. 
That said, we have now liaised with NatWest and as an act of goodwill, they have now 
contacted their international department to liaise with the bank in Australia, to see if it is 
possible to issue a new draft, on a best endeavours basis. Given what I have said 
previously, this is the most I would expect of NatWest and while Mr W may not think this 
goes far enough, I wont be asking anymore of NatWest here.  
I will ask the investigator to ask NatWest to keep Mr W advised of their progress. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
