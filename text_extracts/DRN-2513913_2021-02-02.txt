The complaint
Mr J makes a number of complaints about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
following a block placed on his account.
What happened
Mr J says he wanted to transfer money from his account whilst he was in Holland. He says 
he spoke to NatWest but failed one security question which he says is unfair and says he 
couldnt receive the verification code as NatWest had an incorrect telephone number for him. 
Mr J says the problem meant he was unable to buy food and would like about £5,000 
compensation.
NatWest accepts it ought to have checked Mr Js mobile telephone number and accepts it 
didnt deal with part of the complaint as it should have. It says it has paid £100 compensation 
for that but says it was entitled to restrict the account usage when Mr J failed its security 
process.
Mr J brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint in part. The 
investigator accepted that NatWest hadnt dealt with part of the complaint as it should and 
ought to have checked the telephone number far sooner. He recommended NatWest pay a 
further £200 compensation. The investigator didnt think NatWest made a mistake or acted 
unfairly by restricting the account when Mr J failed NatWests security process and didnt 
think it unreasonable to ask Mr J to attend a branch and also thought it did try and help Mr J 
by repeating its security process which Mr J passed.
Mr J doesnt accept that view and says its not reasonable to block an account when one 
security question was failed and maintains the compensation is not enough.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I uphold this complaint in part and intend to order NatWest to pay a further 
£200 compensation for the reasons I will explain. I appreciate Mr J will be disappointed by 
my decision and appreciate how strongly he feels about what has taken place.
Banks and building societies must have security and fraud processes. I am sure Mr J 
appreciates that and that fraud is a major problem for not only banks and building societies 
but for customers as well. I accept that on occasions that legitimate customers can be 
subject to fraud and security measures and I think that is what took place here. I appreciate 
Mr J says he only failed one security question, but I dont think that matters and I also think 
its up to NatWest to decide, when exercising its commercial judgement, what its security 
process and policy is and not something I can fairly interfere in. So, I dont think NatWest 
acted unfairly or made a mistake by placing restrictions on Mr Js account.
I appreciate that Mr J was in Holland at the time and couldnt attend a NatWest branch. I 
dont think NatWest can be responsible for that and Im satisfied that it tried to help Mr J and 
did remove the account restrictions within what I think was a relatively short time period. 
I accept that part of the problem here was caused by the incorrect telephone number held on 
NatWests records. I cant be sure why that was, but I think NatWest ought to have checked 
that position far sooner which I can see it agrees that it ought to have done so. I accept in 
those circumstances Mr J was caused inconvenience.
The key issue is the level of compensation. And Im satisfied for the reasons I have 
explained that some of the problems could have been avoided if NatWest had checked the 
telephone number far sooner. I dont think Mr J suffered any financial loss as a result of what 
took place, but I accept he was caused distress and inconvenience. So, I have come to the 
overall view that NatWest should increase its compensation offer by £200 which I think fairly 
reflects what took place here and the impact on Mr J. I dont think the compensation Mr J 
would like is justified or reasonable. I appreciate Mr J may not wish to accept the award, but 
I will leave that to him to decide.
I appreciate Mr J would have liked us to have listened to all of the calls between him and 
NatWest but not all of the calls are available. I dont think those calls would have changed 
my view here as I dont think there is any real dispute that Mr J failed a security question and 
I have explained that security measures are for NatWest to decide upon. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order National Westminster Bank 
Plc to pay Mr J a further £200 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
