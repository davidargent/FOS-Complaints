The complaint
Mr T complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr T says that NewDay lent to him irresponsibly when it increased the credit limit on the 
Asda and Aqua credit cards he held.
The Asda credit card account was opened in March 2009 with a credit limit of £2750. The 
credit limit was never increased. Mr T exceeded the credit limit on a number of occasions. In 
April 2013 Mr T stopped using the account and returned the card.
The Aqua credit card account was opened in October 2013 with an initial credit limit of £250. 
This was increased to £500 in February 2014, £600 in June 2014, £1200 in October 2014, 
£2100 in March 2015, £3100 in July 2015, £4050 in December 2015 and to £5250 in July 
2016.
Mr T complained to NewDay. He said he was already in debt when he opened the account 
and he didnt think NewDay shouldve increased his credit limit.
In response, NewDay acknowledged that it shouldnt have agreed the final increase to the 
credit limit. It refunded £12 in cash advance fees and £232.71 interest to the Aqua account.
Mr T wasnt happy with NewDays response and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said that NewDay shouldnt have accepted Mr Ts 
application for the Aqua credit card or offered credit limit increases because Mr T was 
already over indebted and there was a risk that further credit wouldnt be affordable. The 
investigator said that NewDay should rework Mr Ts Aqua card balance so that all interest, 
fees and charges applied from 14 October 2013 are removed.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that when Mr T applied for the Aqua account, the information 
regarding his Asda account wasnt available. It said that when the application for the Aqua 
account was received, there were no external accounts in arrears, no defaults and no 
payment arrangements. NewDay said that it took Mr Ts indebtedness into account during its 
checks and offered a low credit limit of £250. NewDay said that Mr T hadnt made any late 
payments before any of the credit limit increases took place, and that there was no indication 
of financial difficulties until December 2016 when he entered into a payment arrangement 
with another lender. NewDay said it thought the checks it had carried out were reasonable, 
both at the time the account was opened and when the credit limit was increased.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering whether NewDay lent irresponsibly to Mr T, Ive looked at both the opening of 
the Aqua account and the increases to the credit limit. There isnt enough information 
available about the Asda account for me to assess whether NewDay should have agreed to 
open this or whether it lent irresponsibly.
Mr T applied for the Aqua account in October 2013. Ive looked at whether NewDay carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks before agreeing to open the account and extending 
credit to Mr T. 
Ive reviewed the information available to NewDay at the time of Mr Ts application. This 
shows that Mr T had advised NewDay that he had income from employment of £16,500 per 
annum, with additional household income of £7000. The information showed that Mr T had 
£12,000 of unsecured debt. There were no arrears, defaults or county court judgments on Mr 
Ts credit file.
NewDay has said that based on these checks, and its criteria, it decided to provide Mr T with 
a credit card and a credit limit of £250.
Ive also reviewed the Asda account which Mr T held previously. Based on what Ive seen, it 
looks as if Mr T was experiencing difficulties at this time, because he incurred several over 
limit and late payment fees in the 24 months before he handed the card back. 
I appreciate that NewDay didnt manage the Asda card at this time. However, taking all the 
available information into account, I think Mr Ts circumstances at the time, with his low 
income and high level of unsecured debt, together with the CII index rating of 44, meant that 
NewDay ought to have been aware that there was a risk that the lending wasnt affordable 
for Mr T. So, in considering whether the checks carried out by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate, I dont think they were. I think NewDay should have carried out further checks, 
including checks to establish how much of Mr Ts income was being used to service his 
existing unsecured debt.
I appreciate that the initial credit limit was low. However, on balance, I think the level of 
unsecured debt and the low level of income indicated an affordability risk. In the 
circumstances, I dont think NewDay acted responsibly when it offered Mr T the Aqua credit 
card.
Ive taken into account the points that NewDay has made. It said that Mr T hadnt made any 
late payments. However, Mr T has explained that although he made payments to the Aqua 
account on time. He was only able to do this by taking out payday loans.
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont think NewDay has acted responsibly in extending 
credit to Mr T. 
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua should:
Rework Mr Ts Aqua card balance and remove all interest, fees and charges from 14 
October 2013
If this results in an outstanding balance, NewDay should agree a repayment plan with Mr T
If there is no outstanding balance, NewDay should remove any adverse information from Mr 
Ts credit file
If the reworking of the account results in the account being in credit, NewDay should return 
the credit amount to Mr T and pay 8% simple interest per year from the date of payment to the date of settlement
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must take the 
steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
