K820x#14complaint
E, a limited  company, has complained National Westminster  Bank Plc will not prevent 
fraudulent direct debit  payments being paid from their account.
Mr P, a director  of E, has represented them in their complaint.
background
Es account was compromised by someone  using  their details to set up direct debit 
payments to a TV provider. The companys  account  was not used for any direct  debits  at all. 
NatWest understood  that and, as provided  for under  the direct debiting scheme, refunded E 
on each occasion.  The mandate  was also cancelled. 
But this was not the permanent solution  Mr P hoped for. The direct  debit would  simply be set 
up again, and so another payment would leave his account. 
NatWest would duly refund. But in circular fashion, the direct debit was set up again.
Frustrated, Mr P looked to NatWest  to solve the problem. He wondered  whether there was 
something  anything  NatWest could do to prevent the issue.
NatWest said the problem had to be stopped at source  that is the company collecting the 
payments would have  to stop the direct debit being set up. Both NatWest and Mr P explored 
the possibility  of that but this company refused to discuss the problem with either of them 
because ironically  neither  was their customer.
NatWest explained  that Mr P would have to monitor Es account and if it happened again 
they would  refund them again. NatWest explained  there was nothing more  they could do. 
Mr P brought Es complaint to the ombudsman service. 
Our investigator didnt  think she could  ask NatWest to do anything further. She felt they were 
constrained by the rules of the direct debiting scheme although  she sympathised with Mr Ps 
dilemma.
Mr P, on Es behalf, remained unhappy  with this. Hes asked an ombudsman to consider Es 
complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive let both parties know 
I was going to reach another conclusion. Ill explain further.
Firstly I wont  rehearse all the facts  of the complaint  as there arent really in dispute.  E has 
been the victim of someone continually using  their account details to set up direct  debits. As 
these debits get cancelled, another direct  debit arrangement gets set up. Im in no doubt 
fault lies with the TV company. The direct debiting rules state  they should have engaged with 
their customer before  setting up a new direct debit. Im not convinced they did this. Rather 
they kept re-activating the existing instruction when it got cancelled.
Ref: DRN26801852NatWest did offer a solution  E could have changed their account. I understand why 
NatWest suggested  this as an option.  I can also understand that without any incentive this 
didnt seem like an attractive  option for E and involved quite a bit of upheaval for a problem 
that was not of their making.
Its not true to say NatWest could have  done  nothing more here. As I confirmed to NatWest  
they do have a responsibility to sort things  out. Whilst the rules of the direct debiting  scheme 
may limit their options within the scheme,  NatWest should be doing what they can to stop 
their customer being a victim of fraud.  The FCA principles require banks to pay due regard 
to the interests  of its customers. And I didnt think NatWests approach met that.
As it happens, no further attempts have been  made to take direct debits from Es account  in 
the last year and a half. Presumably the fraudster felt theyd tried their luck once too often. 
That means I wont be asking NatWest to attempt any of the solutions  I thought  they may 
consider.
However it means that E had a problem which wasnt resolved and I believe  NatWest should 
have done more at the time.  Ive told both parties  that a payment of £200 in compensation 
goes some way to putting things right. NatWest disagreed with my analysis but despite  
allowing them  some  time to respond, Ive heard nothing further from them.  I still believe this 
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  National Westminster  Bank  Plc to 
pay E £200 for the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2020.
