Ms M said her loans  were  unaffordable, so she concludes ECI did not perform proper 
affordability checks.
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ms complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. ECI disagreed with our adjudicators view and asked  for the 
matter to be looked at again. 
None of the parties commented on loans 1 to 5 being rejected, so in this decision I will only 
consider loans 6 to 11 but I will look at all the loans generally to assess the case  fairly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN15032222But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a check which was more proportionate for Ms Ms situation in 
respect of loans 6 to 11 would most  likely have shown that Ms M was having problems 
managing her money well. I think ECI should  have made a full review of Ms Ms finances  
and previous loan history  before lending  to make sure she could sustainably  repay  the loans. 
On doing so, it is most likely that ECI would have realised Ms M was not engaged in short 
term lending to deal with an unexpected cash-flow,  particularly as the days between loans 
decreased which most  likely indicated she was struggling to repay each loan and because 
the combined repayments were higher for her during  this time. So I dont think  loans 6 to 11 
should have been given.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 11 and ECI should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms M paid on loans 6 to 11 (inclusive);  
pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN15032223remove any negative payment information about loans 6 to 11 (inclusive) from 
Ms Ms credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Ms M a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ms complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right for Ms M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2020.
