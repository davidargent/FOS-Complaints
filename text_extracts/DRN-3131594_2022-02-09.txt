DRN-3131594
The complaint
Mr D is unhappy with the poor service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) and doesnt feel that the amounts of compensation that NatWest have paid take 
due account of the impact of that poor service.
What happened
Mr D contacted NatWest in August 2020 and requested a payment holiday on his loan 
account. NatWest agreed to Mr Ds request and confirmed that a payment holiday would be 
put in place. However, Mr D subsequently received collections letters from NatWest advising 
him that he had missed payments on his loan account and asking him to clear the arrears 
and bring the account up to date.
Mr D wasnt happy about this, or that NatWest had reported missed payments to his credit 
file, and so he raised a complaint. NatWest apologised to Mr D and confirmed that the 
payment holiday hadnt been set up when it should have been. NatWest arranged to 
backdate a payment holiday on Mr Ds account to August 2020 when it should have been set 
up, and they also removed the missed payments reporting from Mr Ds credit file. Finally, 
NatWest reimbursed £7.89 interest that shouldnt have been charged on the loan and made 
a payment of £150 to Mr D to compensate him for the trouble and upset that hed incurred.
Shortly afterwards, Mr D contacted NatWest again to raise a further complaint as hed 
received letters stating that he owed money on an overdraft  even though Mr D didnt have 
an overdraft with NatWest. NatWest couldnt locate any record of letters being sent to Mr D 
about an overdraft, but they acknowledged that they didnt set up Mr Ds requested further 
complaint when they said they would, and so they apologised to Mr D for this and made a 
payment of £50 to Mr D to compensate him for this point.
Mr D didnt feel that NatWests response on either complaint went far enough, and so he 
referred his complaint to this service. One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint. But 
they felt that the responses that NatWest had issued to Mr D, including the payments of 
£150 and £50 compensation, already represented a fair and reasonable resolution to what 
had taken place. So, they didnt uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Mr D remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest dont dispute that they didnt set up a payment holiday on Mr Ds account when 
they should have done, or that they then reported missed payments to Mr Ds credit file.
In circumstances such as this, what this service would expect would be that NatWest would 
undertake the corrective action necessary to return Mr D to the position that he should have 
been in, had the payment holiday been set up on his account correctly in the first instance.
I think that NatWest have done that here, and I say this because NatWest acknowledged 
that errors had been made and set up a payment holiday on Mr Ds account which was 
backdated to when the payment holiday should have been first set up. Furthermore, 
NatWest amended their reporting to the credit reference agencies to remove the incorrectly 
reported missed payments from Mr Ds credit file.
Im aware that Mr D feels that NatWest havent corrected his credit file as they said that they 
would. However, NatWest have been able to demonstrate that theyve amended their 
reporting to the credit reference agencies in line with what they promised, and so Im 
satisfied that no further action is required from NatWest in this regard.
Considering the other aspect of Mr Ds complaint, its notable that NatWest were unable to 
find any record of letters being sent to Mr D about an overdraft. Unfortunately, Mr D has 
confirmed that he didnt retain these letters and as such has been unable to provide them to 
this service. I have no reason to doubt Mr Ds testimony here, but given that this service is 
an impartial dispute resolution service, I dont feel that I can fairly or reasonably uphold this 
aspect of Mr Ds complaint in the absence of these letters, as I feel that if I were to do so I 
would be accepting one partys version of events of the others without corroborating 
evidence, and as such wouldnt be acting impartially.
Finally, while Im aware that Mr D may disagree, I do feel that the compensation amounts 
that NatWest have already paid Mr D here - £150 for the inconvenience incurred because of 
the payment holiday not being set up when it first should have been, and £50 for NatWest 
not setting up Mr Ds second complaint when he first raised it with them  are fair and 
reasonable given the circumstances, and I can confirm that theyre commensurate with what 
this service would expect. As such, I wont be instructing NatWest to make any further 
payment of compensation here.
All of which means that Im satisfied that the responses that NatWest have already issued to 
Mr D in regard to his complaints already represent a fair resolution to whats taken place, 
and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take 
any further action at this time.
I realise that this wont be the outcome Mr D was wanting here, but I hope that hell 
understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
