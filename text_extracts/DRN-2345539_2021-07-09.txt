complaint
Mr and Mrs J say Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) mis-sold them three payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policies. 
background and summary to complaint
PPI covering first loan  February 1999
Mr and Mrs J bought the first policy in 1999 at the same time as taking out a loan. Their 
recollection is that they applied for the loan and PPI policy by phone, but Nationwide has told 
us it was an in-branch sale. 
The policys one-off upfront premium of £435.89 was paid in advance by being added to the 
loan (a single premium) where it attracted interest over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 36-month term and the policy term matched that of the loan. The monthly 
loan repayment was £136.48 with the PPI costing an additional £14.87 making the total 
monthly repayment £151.35. 
PPI covering second loan  September 1999
Mr and Mrs J bought the second policy in 1999 at the same time as taking out a loan. They 
applied for the loan and PPI policy over the phone.
The policys one-off upfront premium of £647.87 was paid in advance by being added to the 
loan (a single premium) where it attracted interest over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 48-month term and the policy term matched that of the loan. The monthly 
loan repayment was £127.76 with the PPI costing an additional £17.06 making the total 
monthly repayment £144.82. 
PPI covering third loan  October 2001
Mr and Mrs J bought the third policy in 2001 at the same time as taking out a loan. They 
applied for the loan and PPI policy over the phone.
The policys one-off upfront premium of £1,943.21was paid in advance by being added to the 
loan (a single premium) where it attracted interest over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 60-month term and the policy term matched that of the loan. The monthly 
loan repayment was £205.44 with the PPI costing an additional £39.92 making the total 
monthly repayment £245.36. 
The policies provided cover solely for Mr J for accident, sickness, unemployment and life  
subject to their exclusions and limitations. They offered to repay Mr and Mrs Js monthly loan 
repayments for the remaining terms in the event of a successful disability claim and 12 
months in the event of unemployment. 
Mr J has told us that at the time of the two sales made in 1999 he was employed as a 
maintenance fitter. He has told us he was entitled to 12 months sick pay if he was too unwell 
to work. He had savings of more than 12 months worth of his salary. He was also entitled to 
redundancy pay if he lost his job as well as death in service benefit. Mr J told us of three 
medical conditions he suffered from before he took the policies. 
We asked Mr J for further information about his circumstances, and for the sale in 2001, but 
we didnt hear anything more, so Ive based my decision on what he has told us. 
As all three of the policies were for the benefit of Mr J only, it is his circumstances Ill be 
considering in this decision. 
Nationwide has sent us screenshots to show that the loan accounts closed in January 2000, 
October 2001 and June 2003 respectively. 
Mr and Mrs Js representative has made lengthy and substantial representations on their 
behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have read and considered them all carefully. In 
summary, Mr and Mrs Js representative says:
Nationwide failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the times of the sales. 
In those circumstances, applying the regulators rules and guidance for businesses 
on handling PPI complaints under DISP APP 3, it should be presumed Mr and Mrs J 
wouldnt have taken out the policies and the complaint should be upheld.                 
Mr and Mrs Js representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that 
presumption;
The policies excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress, which are some of 
the most common reasons people are off work. This significantly reduced the value 
of cover;
The true costs including interest and the fact it was unlikely you could make a 
successful claim meant the policies were of inherently poor value as shown by the 
low claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good faith means Nationwide 
should have told Mr and Mrs J about the poor value; 
The cancellation terms were unfair;
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Nationwide should have 
explained the significance of the exclusions and limitations of cover to Mr and Mrs J 
and the impact they would have had on their chances of making a claim.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mr and Mrs J disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
for several reasons. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
My findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered all 
the evidence and arguments available to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
PPI covering loans one and two  February and September 1999When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr and Mrs Js. I dont intend to set that 
out in much detail here, but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs Js complaint
These sales took place in 1999 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code of practice in June 2000 and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this part of the complaint, nor is the FCAs Perimeter guidance 
(PERG). 
The credit agreements themselves concluded in 2000 and 2001 respectively. That means 
the unfair relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme 
Court judgment in Plevin about s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the 
FCA about the handling of complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the 
Plevin judgment, arent applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular, The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other 
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries 
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected of 
intermediaries like Nationwide at the time. So, Im satisfied I should take the ABI code and 
these other publications into account when deciding, what is in my opinion, fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Js case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including: the law relating to 
negligence, contract (including the express and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001, Im also required to take into account what 
determination the relevant former scheme  in this case the Office of the Building Societies 
Ombudsman  might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Building Societies Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman 
was required to decide complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances.Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the sale 
of PPI. These sales took place before insurance mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Nationwide was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were 
guidance when considering Mr and Mrs Js complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account, it seems to me that the key questions I need 
to consider in deciding what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
- If Nationwide gave advice, whether it advised Mr and Mrs J with reasonable care and 
skill  in particular, whether the policies were appropriate or suitable for them, given 
their needs and circumstances. 
- Whether Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs J sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policies, 
including drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not 
misleading way  the main provisions of the policies and significant limitations and 
exclusions. 
- If, having considered these questions, I determine the complaint in favour of            
Mr and Mrs J, I must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mr and Mrs J 
suffered loss or damage and what I consider would amount to fair compensation for 
that loss or damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr and Mrs J 
and Nationwide, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Js complaint about the two sales 
made in 1999. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mr and Mrs J know they had a choice?
Nationwide had to make it clear that the PPI policies were optional. Mr and Mrs J say they 
were included as part of the loans package.
 
Nationwide has told us that the first sale was made in-branch and the second sale was made 
over the phone. While I cant know for certain what Mr and Mrs J were told during both sales 
(a recording of the phone sale isnt available), Nationwide has been able to give us copies of 
the loan agreements which Mr and Mrs J received after they applied for these two loans. 
Both agreements needed to be signed and dated by Mr and Mrs J before the loans and the 
PPI policies went ahead, and I can see that this has been done in both cases.
The loan agreements (they are identical) lay out the cost of the loans and the PPI in table 
form. There is a column entitled Optional Credit Insurance where the cost of the PPI is set 
out separate from the loan itself. 
Upon receiving these, and before signing to accept the loans and PPI, I would have 
expected Mr and Mrs J to have queried things before they went ahead if the way the PPI 
was described was at odds with how it was described to them during the meeting and phone 
call.
 
Taking everything into account, I think its more likely that Mr and Mrs J knew the policies 
were optional and they agreed to take them out without undue pressure. did Nationwide provide advice?
Nationwide says it didnt provide advice during either of the sales. Mr and Mrs J havent said 
either way. Based on what we know about how sales like Mr and Mrs Js were carried out, 
advice was not provided. And because, Ive not seen anything to persuade me something 
different happened in Mr and Mrs Js case  and without any alternative testimony from Mr 
and Mrs J for me to consider  I dont think NBS provided advice on either occasion when it 
sold them the PPI. 
This means Nationwide didnt have to check if the PPI was suitable for Mr and Mrs J. 
Instead, it had to give them sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable             
Mr and Mrs J to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policies, including 
drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policies and significant limitations and exclusions. 
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs J were given a broad description of 
what the policies were intended to cover (that is that the policies would protect their 
payments if Mr J was unable to work through accident, sickness and unemployment). I have 
reached this conclusion because I think at the very least this would have been discussed 
during the meeting and phone call  I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs J would have taken out 
the policies without any sense of what the policies were and what the approximate costs 
were.  
But the evidence from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether Nationwide gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefits, about the costs or about the exclusions or 
limitations before Mr and Mrs J agreed to take out the policies. 
So, I dont think Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs J sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policies, including 
drawing their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policies and significant limitations and exclusions.
 
Ive considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling PPI complaints set out at DISP App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings Ive highlighted above, Mr and Mrs Js representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like                
Mr and Mrs Js. Ive considered these carefully and summarised them as:
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr and Mrs Js representative considers to be 
poor value  and the fact that much of the premium went to the business rather than 
the insurer. 
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business shouldnt have just 
told Mr and Mrs J about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further 
and explained the significance of them to them. 
Im not persuaded by Mr and Mrs Js representatives views on this. The duty of utmost good 
faith in insurance law imposed a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose material 
facts and not to make material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what a court 
would say  I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to disclose the claims ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations and 
exclusions in the way Mr and Mrs J has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry 
codes and standards of good industry practice applicable to this complaint, I dont think its 
fair and reasonable to conclude that Nationwide ought to have done either.
 
What effect did Nationwides shortcomings have on Mr and Mrs J? To what extent did 
Mr and Mrs J suffer loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Nationwide didnt do all it should have done when it sold these policies to     
Mr and Mrs J. So, Ive gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to 
conclude Mr and Mrs J suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer this, I must decide 
whether or not Mr and Mrs J would have still taken out the policies, had Nationwide done 
things properly. 
Mr and Mrs J say they would not have taken them out and believe I should presume this to 
be the case given the significant failings identified above. Ive considered the representations 
of both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
As these were non-advised sales, Mr and Mrs J had to weigh up in their own minds the cost 
of the policies against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if they didnt 
insure against the risk of Mr J being unable to work. 
As Ive found above, Mr and Mrs J chose to take these policies out. So, I consider that its 
reasonable to conclude they had some interest in the benefits offered by this type of 
insurance. But they made this decision based on incomplete information. So, what             
Mr and Mrs J thought they were getting is not exactly what they got. The extent to which this 
differed is a relevant consideration when determining if Mr and Mrs J have suffered any loss 
or detriment. 
Although I think its likely Mr and Mrs J understood from what was discussed during the 
meeting and phone call that they were borrowing the money to pay for each policy and that it 
would cost extra each month, I cant be certain Mr and Mrs J were given all of the cost 
information during the meeting and phone call. 
Having said that, Mr and Mrs J were sent a loan agreement each time, which as I have said 
above set out the cost of the PPI clearly separating out the PPI premium, the interest on the 
premium, the total cost and the resulting monthly cost. So before signing the agreements I 
think Mr and Mrs J were given sufficient information to understand the cost. And they could 
have queried things before signing if it wasnt acceptable to them. 
Im not persuaded NBS made clear exactly what Mr and Mrs J would get back in return in 
the event they made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs Js expectations 
about what the policies would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet their 
loan payments) were significantly different to what the policies actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr and Mrs J thought they had 
bought and what they actually bought were the following:
The policies excluded claims relating to any medical condition or disease which Mr J 
knew of or should reasonably have known of on the start date. Or, any medical 
condition or disease for which Mr J received treatment, advice or was referred for 
investigation during the 12 months before the start date and which recurred within 12 
months of the start date of the policy; 
The policy limited, and in some situations, excluded unemployment cover if Mr J 
wasnt a permanent employee.The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr J would have to 
be unable to do any work as certified by a doctor. 
I do accept that there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions above might well have 
caused Mr and Mrs J pause for thought  and may well have caused them to conclude that 
the policies werent as good as they thought, and they might have decided not to proceed. 
The limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might 
have dissuaded some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr and Mrs J from 
taking out the policies. 
But, the evidence about Mr and Mrs Js circumstances at the time of sale shows that the 
policies werent fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them. Mr J was eligible for their 
benefits and they provided cover that, despite their limitations and exclusions, couldve 
proved valuable to them should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen 
any evidence to suggest they wouldve been caught by any of the significant exclusions    
Mr J was in permanent employment. And although Mr J says he had three medical 
conditions before the policies were taken out  and the policies might not have provided 
cover had Mr J needed to take time off work because of those conditions, I dont think better 
information about this exclusion would have put them off agreeing to take them.
 
I say this because the first two conditions for which Mr J had time off from work were 
ligament/muscular problems for which Mr J received treatment, but Mr J hasnt said they 
caused him any ongoing problems or needed further treatment. And the third condition was 
again resolved by treatment without any significant time off work and Mr J didnt tell us of 
any ongoing problems. So, I dont think these conditions would have been upper most in    
Mr and Mrs Js minds when they took the policies to the extent that they would have likely 
changed their minds about taking them out had things been made clearer. So, I still think 
they had some good reasons to take the policies out.
The policies didnt exclude back or mental health conditions or place any additional 
restrictions or more onerous evidential requirements in the event of a claim on those 
grounds than would have applied to any other disability claim. And I think its unlikely          
Mr and Mrs J would have expected to make a disability claim on the policies without first 
providing some evidence to support that claim.
To make a disability claim, Mr J needed to be totally unable to do any work as certified by a 
doctor. I dont think this is likely to be too different to what Mr and Mrs J would have 
expected in order to make a claim. So, it seems unlikely Mr and Mrs J would have thought 
they would have been able to make a successful claim if Mr J was still working. 
Both the policies did provide a pro-rata refund if they were cancelled early, so the policies 
provided flexibility if Mr and Mrs J decided to repay the loans early and cancel the policies.
Having considered all of the evidence and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs J would still have taken out the policies. The policies were sufficiently 
close to what its likely they thought they were getting and provided benefits that would help 
them manage the consequences were Mr J made redundant, or unable to work through 
accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not that                  
Mr and Mrs J would have taken out the policies in any event notwithstanding the limitations 
on cover.
Mr and Mrs Js representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 
3) make it clear that, where a significant failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have taken out PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.That guidance is for firms, but it is a relevant consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things when I decide what is in my opinion fair and reasonable. Considering 
the purpose of the guidance, I dont think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken. 
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales processes. In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should 
be presumed Mr and Mrs J would not have bought the PPI they bought unless, in the 
particular circumstances of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account                    
Mr and Mrs Js circumstances as detailed above, I consider it reasonable to conclude the 
position Mr and Mrs J found themselves in as result of the sales was the same position they 
would have been in had the breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mr and Mrs J believe the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales 
processes were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were highly material and we have 
failed to give proper weight to the evidence  including their own comments that they would 
not have taken out the policies. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance for firms set out at DISP App 3 (which I 
dont consider I am), Im only doing so because I dont consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr and Mrs J in the position they would have been in if 
they had not bought the policies. 
That is because, while I accept its possible they wouldnt have taken out the policies, Im 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that they would still have taken 
out the PPI had they been given clear, fair and not misleading information about the policies 
they were buying.
So, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those circumstances, to conclude 
Nationwide should pay Mr and Mrs J compensation, as that would put them in a better 
position than they would have been in if everything had happened as it should have done.
 
Ive also thought about the approach Mr and Mrs Js representative says a court might take if 
it were to find Nationwide had been in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. But this doesnt 
persuade me to alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case. For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mr and Mrs J in a better position than if everything had happened as it 
should have done. 
PPI covering loan three  October 2001
relevant considerations
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr and Mrs Js. I dont intend to set that 
out in much detail here, but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs Js complaint.This sale took place in 2001 before the sale of general insurance products like this became 
regulated in January 2005. So, the FSAs (and FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses 
and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint, nor is the 
FCAs Perimeter guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded in 2003. That means the unfair relationship provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin about 
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling of 
complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the Plevin judgment, arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular, The General Insurance Standards Councils General Insurance 
Code for private customers  the GISC Code. 
This sale was made during a period of industry self-regulation by the General Insurance 
Standards Council (GISC). It published the GISC code, which set out minimum standards of 
good practice for its members to follow when selling insurance, including PPI. 
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) also published a number of codes, which I consider 
to be indicative of the standards of good industry practice expected from intermediaries, like 
Nationwide, selling insurance at this time:
The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for 
all intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other than 
Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 

The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries 
 
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected of 
intermediaries like Nationwide at the time. So, Im satisfied I should take the ABI code and 
these other publications into account when deciding, what is in my opinion, fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Js case. 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including: the law relating to 
negligence, contract (including the express and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001, Im also required to take into account what 
determination the relevant former scheme  in this case the Office of the Building Societies 
Ombudsman  might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Building Societies Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman 
was required to decide complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances.Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Nationwide was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were 
guidance when considering Mr and Mrs Js complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account, it seems to me that the key questions I need 
to consider in deciding what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
- If Nationwide gave advice, whether it advised Mr and Mrs J with reasonable care and 
skill  in particular, whether the policy was appropriate or suitable for them, given 
their needs and circumstances. 
- Whether Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs J sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policy, 
including drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not 
misleading way  the main provisions of the policy and significant limitations and 
exclusions. 
- If, having considered these questions, I determine the complaint in favour of            
Mr and Mrs J, I must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mr and Mrs J 
suffered loss or damage and what I consider would amount to fair compensation for 
that loss or damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr and Mrs J 
and Nationwide, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Js complaint about this policy. Ive 
set out my reasoning below. 
did Mr and Mrs J know they had a choice?
Nationwide had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. Mr and Mrs J say it was 
included as part of the loan package. 
This sale was made over the phone. While I cant know for certain what Mr and Mrs J were 
told during the call (a recording of the phone sale isnt available), Nationwide has been able 
to give us a copy of the loan agreement which Mr and Mrs J received after they applied for 
the loan. The agreement needed to be signed and dated by Mr and Mrs J before the loan 
and the PPI went ahead and I can see that this has been done.
The loan agreement lays out the cost of the loan and the PPI in table form. There is a 
column entitled Optional Credit Insurance where the cost of the PPI was set out separate 
from the loan itself. 
Upon receiving this, and before signing to accept the loan and PPI, I would have expected 
Mr and Mrs J to have queried things before they went ahead if the way the PPI was 
described was at odds with how it was described to them during the phone call. 
Taking everything into account, I think its more likely that Mr and Mrs J knew the policy was 
optional and they agreed to take it out without undue pressure. did Nationwide provide advice?
Nationwide says it didnt provide advice during the sale. Mr and Mrs J havent said either 
way. Based on what we know about how sales like Mr and Mrs Js were carried out, advice 
was not provided. And because, Ive not seen anything to persuade me something different 
happened in Mr and Mrs Js case  and without any alternative testimony from Mr and Mrs J 
for me to consider  I dont think NBS provided advice when it sold them the PPI. 
This means Nationwide didnt have to check if the PPI was suitable for Mr and Mrs J. 
Instead, it had to give them sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable             
Mr and Mrs J to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policy, including 
drawing to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policy and significant limitations and exclusions. 
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs J were given a broad description of 
what the policies were intended to cover (that is that the policies would protect their 
payments if Mr J was unable to work through accident, sickness and unemployment). I have 
reached this conclusion because I think at the very least this would have been discussed 
during the phone call  I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs J would have taken out the policy 
without any sense of what the policies was and what the approximate costs were.
  
But the evidence from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether Nationwide gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, about the cost or about the exclusions or 
limitations before Mr and Mrs J agreed to take out the policy. 
So, I dont think Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs J sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policy, including 
drawing their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policy and significant limitations and exclusions. 
Ive considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling PPI complaints set out at DISP App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings Ive highlighted above, Mr and Mrs Js representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like                
Mr and Mrs Js. Ive considered these carefully and summarised them as:
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr and Mrs Js representative considers to be 
poor value  and the fact that much of the premium went to the business rather than 
the insurer. 
- The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business shouldnt have just 
told Mr and Mrs J about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone further 
and explained the significance of them to them. 
Im not persuaded by Mr and Mrs Js representatives views on this. The duty of utmost good 
faith in insurance law imposed a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose material 
facts and not to make material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what a court 
would say  I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to 
disclose the claims ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the way Mr and Mrs J has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry 
codes and standards of good industry practice applicable to this complaint, I dont think its 
fair and reasonable to conclude that Nationwide ought to have done either. 
What effect did Nationwides shortcomings have on Mr and Mrs J? To what extent did 
Mr and Mrs J suffer loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Nationwide didnt do all it should have done when it sold this policy to          
Mr and Mrs J. So, Ive gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to 
conclude Mr and Mrs J suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer this, I must decide 
whether or not Mr and Mrs J would have still taken out the policy, had Nationwide done 
things properly. 
Mr and Mrs J say they would not have taken it out and believe I should presume this to be 
the case given the significant failings identified above. Ive considered the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
As this was a non-advised sale, Mr and Mrs J had to weigh up in their own minds the cost of 
the policy against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if they didnt insure 
against the risk of being unable to work. 
As Ive found above, Mr and Mrs J chose to take this policy out. So, I consider that its 
reasonable to conclude they had some interest in the benefits offered by this type of 
insurance. But they made this decision based on incomplete information. So, what             
Mr and Mrs J thought they were getting is not exactly what they got. The extent to which this 
differed is a relevant consideration when determining if Mr and Mrs J has suffered any loss 
or detriment. 
Although I think its likely Mr and Mrs J understood from what was discussed during the 
phone call that they were borrowing the money to pay for the policy and that it would cost 
extra each month, I cant be certain Mr and Mrs J were given all of the cost information 
during the phone call. 
Having said that, Mr and Mrs J were sent a loan agreement, which as I have said above set 
out the cost of the PPI clearly separating out the PPI premium, the interest on the premium, 
the total cost and the resulting monthly cost. So before signing the agreement I think Mr and 
Mrs J were given sufficient information to understand the cost. And they could have queried 
things before signing if it wasnt acceptable to them. 
Im not persuaded Nationwide made clear exactly what Mr and Mrs J would get back in 
return in the event they made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs Js 
expectations about what the policy would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient to 
meet their loan payments) were significantly different to what the policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr and Mrs J thought they had 
bought and what they actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to any medical condition or disease which Mr J 
knew of or should reasonably have known of on the start date. Or, any medical 
condition or disease for which Mr J received treatment, advice or was referred for 
investigation during the 12 months before the start date and which recurred within 12 
months of the start date of the policy; 
The policy limited, and in some situations, excluded unemployment cover if Mr J 
wasnt a permanent employee.The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr J would have to 
be unable to do any work as certified by a doctor. 
I do accept that there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions above might well have 
caused Mr and Mrs J pause for thought  and may well have caused them to conclude that 
the policy wasnt as good as they thought, and they might have decided not to proceed. The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might have 
dissuaded some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr and Mrs J from taking 
out the policy. 
But, the evidence about Mr and Mrs Js circumstances at the time of sale shows that the 
policy wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for them. Mr J was eligible for the benefits 
and it provided cover that, despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved valuable to 
them should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen any evidence to 
suggest they wouldve been caught by any of the significant exclusions  Mr J was in 
permanent employment. And although Mr J says he had three medical conditions before the 
policy was taken out  and the policy might not have provided cover had Mr J needed to take 
time off work because of those conditions, I dont think better information about this 
exclusion would have put them off agreeing to take it. 
I say this because the first two conditions for which Mr J had time off from work were 
ligament/muscular problems for which Mr J received treatment, and Mr J hasnt said they 
caused him any ongoing problems or needed further treatment. And the third condition was 
again resolved by treatment without any significant time off work and Mr J didnt tell us of 
any ongoing problems. So, I dont think these conditions would have been upper most in    
Mr and Mrs Js minds when they took the policy to the extent that they would have likely 
changed their minds about taking it out had things been made clearer. So, I still think they 
had some good reasons to take the policy out.
The policy didnt exclude back or mental health conditions or place any additional restrictions 
or more onerous evidential requirements in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied to any other disability claim. And I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs J would 
have expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some evidence 
to support that claim.
To make a disability claim, Mr J needed to be totally unable to do any work as certified by a 
doctor. I dont think this is likely to be too different to what Mr and Mrs J would have 
expected in order to make a claim. So, it seems unlikely Mr and Mrs J would have thought 
they would have been able to make a successful claim if Mr J was still working. 
The policy did provide a pro-rata refund if it was cancelled early, so the policy provided 
flexibility if Mr and Mrs J decided to repay the loan early and cancel the policy.
Having considered all of the evidence and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs J would still have taken out the policy. The policy was sufficiently close 
to what its likely they thought they were getting and provided benefits that would help them 
manage the consequences were Mr and Mrs J made redundant, or unable to work through 
accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not that                  
Mr and Mrs J would have taken out the policy in any event notwithstanding the limitations on 
cover.
Mr and Mrs Js representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 
3) make it clear that, where a significant failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have taken out PPI, unless there is evidence to outweigh the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.That guidance is for firms, but it is a relevant consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things when I decide what is in my opinion fair and reasonable. Considering 
the purpose of the guidance, I dont think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken. 
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances, DISP App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mr and Mrs J would not have bought the PPI they bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account                    
Mr and Mrs Js circumstances as detailed above, I consider it reasonable to conclude the 
position Mr and Mrs J found themselves in as result of the sale was the same position they 
would have been in had the breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mr and Mrs J believe the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales 
process were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were highly material and we have failed 
to give proper weight to the evidence  including their own comments that they would not 
have taken out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance for firms set out at DISP App 3 (which I 
dont consider I am), Im only doing so because I dont consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr and Mrs J in the position they would have been in if 
they had not bought the policy. 
That is because, while I accept its possible they wouldnt have taken out the policy, Im 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that they would still have taken 
out the PPI had they been given clear, fair and not misleading information about the policy 
they were buying.
So, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those circumstances, to conclude 
Nationwide should pay Mr and Mrs J compensation, as that would put them in a better 
position than they would have been in if everything had happened as it should have done. 
Ive also thought about the approach Mr and Mrs Js representative says a court might take if 
it were to find Nationwide had been in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. But this doesnt 
persuade me to alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case. For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mr and Mrs J in a better position than if everything had happened as it 
should have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs J to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 August 2021.
