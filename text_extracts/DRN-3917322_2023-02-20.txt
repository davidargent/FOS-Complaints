The complaint
Mr D complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax (Halifax) is refusing to refund 
him the amount he lost as the result of a scam. 
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary Mr D was contacted by an unknown third-party (X) via the application telegram 
asking Mr D if he wanted to make an additional income in his spare time. X explained that 
the business Mr D would be working with was called Digital River (DR).
Mr D looked at the DR website and was convinced by both X and the website that this was a 
legitimate opportunity.
As part of the proposed opportunity Mr D was asked to pay funds into the investment via 
Binance, a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and that he would see returns on his 
investment.
Convinced by X, Mr D started to invest and sent the following payments to Binance via his 
debit card that were then forwarded to the scammer:
1. 15 April 2022 - £200.00
2. 15 April 2022  £39.05
3. 15 April 2022 - £15.00
4. 15 April 2022 - £15.00
5. 17 April 2022 - £40.65
6. 17 April 2022 - £120.36
7. 17 April 2022  £31.89
8. 17 April 2022 - £163.39
9. 17 April 2022 - £200.05
10. 18 April 2022 - £183.30
11. 18 April 2022 - £637.67
12. 18 April 2022 - £400.13
13. 19 April 2022 - £479.16
14. 19 April 2022 - £230.00
15. 19 April 2022 - £230.00
16. 19 April 2022 - £560.10
17. 20 April 2022 - £640.49
18. 20 April 2022 - £184.26
19. 20 April 2022 - £1,599.80
20. 20 April 2022 - £384.44
A total of £6,318.74 was sent. During the time Mr D was sending money via Binance to the 
scammer he was also able to withdraw a total of £3,940.74.
When Mr D attempted to withdraw further funds from the investment, he was told he would 
first have to make further payments. Mr D explained he was unable to send any further funds 
and was told no further withdrawal could be made until he did. Mr D was unable to recover 
his .
Our Investigator considered Mr Ds complaint but thought Halifaxs decision not to refund Mr 
D was fair. So, he didnt ask Halifax to do anything more.
As Mr D disagreed this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Halifax was unable to process a chargeback for the payments Mr D made in relation to this 
scam to Binance.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mr D was dealing with X, which was the person that instigated the scam. But Mr D didnt 
make the debit card payments to X directly, he paid a separate cryptocurrency exchange 
(Binance). This is important because Halifax was only able to process chargeback claims 
against the merchant he paid (Binance), not another party (such as X).
The service provided by Binance would have been to convert or facilitate conversion of
Mr Ds payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Binance provided the service that was 
requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Mr D paid. As Binance provided 
the requested service to Mr D any chargeback attempt would likely fail.
Mr D has accepted he authorised the payments he made to Binance, so the starting point 
here is that Mr D is responsible. However, banks and other Payment Services Providers 
(PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to 
undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether Halifax should have been aware of the scam and stepped in to 
prevent the payments Mr D was making.
All the payments Mr D was able to make using his debit card were for relatively small 
amounts. Mr D was also receiving funds from Binance throughout the time he was making 
the payments. So, I dont think it was unreasonable that the payments didnt trigger Halifaxs 
fraud prevention systems.
However, Mr D did contact Halifax on 16 April 2022 saying he was unable to process a 
larger payment to Binance and Halifax asked Mr D several questions designed to uncover 
potential fraud.During this call Mr D confirmed he had not been contacted by a third-party to make the 
investment and the funds were going to an account in his own name. Mr D had not given an 
accurate account of what was happening and for this reason the scam was not identified.
Even if Halifax had stepped in and asked questions on other occasions, I am not convinced 
Mr D would have given an accurate account that would have enabled Halifax to uncover the 
scam.
For the reasons given above I dont think Halifax was able to identify the scam or prevent it 
from taking place. So, its not responsible for Mr Ds loss and does not have to provide him 
with a refund.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 March 2023.
