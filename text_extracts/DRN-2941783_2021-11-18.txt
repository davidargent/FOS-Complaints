The complaint
Mr T complains Santander UK Plc blocked his account and then took an unreasonable 
amount of time to unblock it.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In September 2020 Mr T attempted to make some payments using online banking. This led 
to his account being blocked for security reasons. Mr T isnt persuaded his actions should 
have prompted a security concern. I understand his reasoning. But ultimately, its for 
Santander to decide what measures it puts in place to prevent fraud and Im satisfied its 
those measures which resulted in the account being blocked. It may have been frustrating 
for Mr T, but I dont find Santander made an error here. 
Mr T called Santander to get the block removed. He was told his account would likely be 
unblocked by 9pm that day. By the following morning the account hadnt been unblocked so 
Mr T called again. The block was removed a few hours later. Mr T thinks the time he spent 
calling Santander (about 90 minutes in total) and Santander taking a day to unblock his 
account is unreasonable. I think he has a point. But the block didnt lead to a financial loss 
for Mr T. And Santander apologised and paid him Â£75 compensation. Thats fair.
 
Mr T has other payment related complaints against Santander, but these are being 
considered separately.
My final decision
Santander UK Plcs apology and compensation was a fair resolution to this complaint, so I 
dont require it to take any further action.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2021.
