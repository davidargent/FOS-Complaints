The complaint
Mrs G complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua should have recorded a default on her 
account when she entered a debt management plan.
What happened
Mrs G had a NewDay branded credit card. In 2014, she suffered financial difficulties, which 
resulted in her entering a debt management plan, through a debt management charity in 
January 2015. This avoided a default as she maintained the debt management plan 
payments, even though they were reduced payments. NewDay later decided to sell the loan 
to a debt collection company in July 2016.
Mrs G noticed that her credit report showed the account had defaulted in February 2020. 
This was reported by the debt collection company. Mrs G made a complaint to NewDay and 
she said that the default date should show, as per the Information Commissioners Officer 
(ICO) rules, to a date no later than 3-6 months after she missed her first payment towards 
this debt and no longer met the terms of the credit agreement. She said she would like the 
default date changed to a date no later than 1 February 2015, which is the date she entered 
into the debt management plan through the debt management charity. 
NewDay did not uphold Mrs Gs complaint. They explained that when they sell a debt, it is 
the debt collection company who then report payment activity to the Credit Reference 
Agencies (CRAs) and the information on her credit file relating to the default was not 
provided by NewDay. They said if she believed the information on her credit file was 
incorrect, then she should contact the debt collection company.
Mrs G brought the complaint to our service. She had also complained to the debt collection 
company about the date they registered the default. The debt collection company agreed to 
backdate the default to October 2017, as they wrote to Mrs G to ask her to pay arrears to 
avoid a default in October 2017, but as they couldnt see the arrears were cleared then, they 
agreed to backdate the default to October 2017.
Our investigator did not uphold Mrs Gs complaint against NewDay. He said that although 
Mrs G correctly pointed out that the ICO say a default can be recorded once someone is in
three months of arrears, and normally by six months at the latest, the ICO guidance also
says that if NewDay agrees to accept lower or reduced payments, and the terms of that
agreement isnt broken, that a default shouldnt be recorded. Our investigator said that while 
a default was later recorded by the debt collection company, that wasnt NewDays 
responsibility.
Mrs G asked for an Ombudsman to review her complaint. She said that she would have 
been better off not paying anything in 2015 and letting the account default then. Mrs G 
added that she felt she was being penalised for responsibly seeking help in the way of a 
debt management plan and continuing to pay off her debt. She said that by not applying the 
default at the time, that this had not benefited her.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to be clear to Mrs G that I can only look into the actions of NewDay here and not what 
the debt management company did by registering a default. This is because the complaint 
Im looking at here is against NewDay only.
NewDay have not registered a default at any point on Mrs Gs credit file, nor have they 
instructed the debt collection company to do so, therefore I cant ask NewDay to backdate a 
default they havent registered. Instead, Ill be looking at if NewDay should have registered a 
default, which in turn, would mean the debt collection company wouldnt have registered a 
default at a later date.
Our investigator has explained to Mrs G the ICO guidance, so I wont repeat that here. But in 
summary, as an agreement was made with the debt management charity and NewDay to 
accept lower payments, the debt management plan would show on Mrs Gs credit file and 
while arrears may accrue and increase, a default would not be recorded while Mrs G made 
the agreed payments.  
A default should be recorded when the relationship between the borrower and the lender 
appears to have broken down and is usually a last resort. But here, Mrs G used a debt 
management charity to agree a debt management plan with NewDay, so I cant say that the 
relationship appeared to have broken down when she has been proactive in trying to come 
to an arrangement, which could and did prevent a default here.
Ive looked at Mrs Gs credit card statements. I can see that she made a payment to 
NewDay on 18 November 2014, but then she missed her following payment which was due 
by 24 December 2014. So I cant agree with Mrs G that a default should have been recorded 
when she made agreed a debt management plan with NewDay, as she would have been 
about five weeks in arrears at the she went to the debt management charity. 
Ive considered what Mrs G has said about what would have happened if she didnt make 
payments in 2015 and she would be better off now. She also said she was being penalised 
for continuing to pay the debt. While I have sympathy for her situation, Im not persuaded 
this is the fault of NewDay. I say this as NewDay did not register a default, the debt 
collection company did. NewDay acted upon her instruction to make a payment arrangement 
with Mrs G, without negatively affecting her credit file in the form of a default.
I would not have expected NewDay to have registered a default when they agreed to accept 
a debt management plan to avoid a default. Im satisfied that NewDay acted fairly and 
responsibly to work with Mrs G and to stop interest and fees on the outstanding debt, which 
would have helped her at the time to focus on repaying the outstanding debt, as part of the 
debt management plan. As Im satisfied NewDay were fair to not register a default on the 
account, for the reasons Ive already explained, it follows that I wont be asking NewDay to 
take any further action.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2022.
