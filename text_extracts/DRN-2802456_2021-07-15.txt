The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams closed and defaulted his credit card 
account and recorded this information on his credit file. 
What happened
Mr C held a Debenhams branded credit card which was provided by NewDay Ltd. 
Mr C says that, in early 2020, he applied for a loan from another lender in order to repay the 
outstanding balance on his Debenhams credit card. And that he tried to keep NewDay 
updated on the progress of his application but, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he was 
unable to get through to speak with a representative. 
In June 2020, he says he received a letter - dated April 2020, and it was only at this point he 
found out that NewDay had defaulted and closed his account. So, he complained to 
NewDay. 
NewDay didnt agree that it had administered Mr Cs incorrectly. It says Mr C contacted it in 
July 2019 to say he was experiencing financial difficulties. And that a repayment 
arrangement was agreed - Â£100 per month for six months. But it goes on to say that only 
one payment was received. So, it sent Mr C an arrears letter and Default Notice - in 
November 2019. And, subsequently, a Notice of Termination was issued in December 2019. 
 
Mr C referred his complaint to us, and it was passed to an investigator. But she didnt think 
NewDay had done anything wrong. She thought NewDay had acted in line with the 
regulations in place for dealing with an account in arrears. So, she didnt uphold Mr Cs 
complaint. 
Mr C didnt agree. He acknowledged that hed had problems maintaining his account before 
2020. But he said the Covid-19 pandemic had made it difficult for him to contact NewDay. 
He wanted the default removed so he could apply elsewhere for a loan to repay the credit 
card balance. But the investigator maintained that the default had been registered correctly. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me to make a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This includes the terms and conditions of Mr Cs account - which he would have agreed to 
when he entered the credit agreement. These say that Mr Cs account can be ended if you 
fail to pay contractual payments on time And that NewDay can disclose information about 
you and the conduct of your account to licensed credit reference agencies (which would 
make it more difficult for you to borrow in future). 
And, as the investigator explained, the guidance from the Information Commissioners Office 
(ICO) says that a lender can record an account as being in default if the account holder 
doesnt keep up with payments and this can generally happen when the account is between 
three to six months in arrears. 
Having taken the above into account, Im sorry to disappoint Mr C, but I havent been 
persuaded that NewDay acted unfairly in this case. Ill explain why. 
Its not in dispute that Mr C fell into financial difficulty in 2019  the call recordings Ive 
listened to between NewDay and Mr C make that clear. And I empathise with Mr C given the 
circumstances and events he outlined during these calls. 
I can see that NewDay took these circumstances into account and agreed a six-month 
payment plan at 0% interest to help Mr C during this difficult time. In doing so, I think 
NewDay was meeting its obligations to treat Mr C positively and sympathetically given his 
situation.
But I note that Mr C only made one payment during the six-month payment plan. So, I dont 
think NewDay did anything wrong when it sent an arrears letter, Default Notice and 
Termination Letter to Mr C in late 2019  this is within the ICO guidelines mentioned above. 
And the letters explain what Mr C needed to do to get his account back on track and what 
action may be taken if this didnt happen  including the impact on Mr Cs credit file. 
I note Mr C says he hadnt been made aware that this action would be taken before a letter 
he received in June 2020. But the letters issued by NewDay are addressed correctly and 
were sent on separate dates. While post can go astray from time to time, I think its unlikely 
that all the letters would have failed to reach Mr C  particularly, as these were sent before 
there had been any impact on the postal system from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, I note that Mr C called NewDay in January 2020. So, I think its likely he was 
calling as he was receipt of at least one these letters mentioned above. Even if that wasnt 
the case, having listened to the call recordings between NewDay and Mr C in January 2020, 
Im satisfied that NewDay explained at this point that his account had been terminated.  
I also note Mr C was referred  during this call, to NewDays customer care team. A 30-day 
hold was placed on Mr Cs account to enable him to complete and income and expenditure 
form so that NewDay would be able to assess Mr Cs financial circumstances. And it was 
confirmed that while the hold was in place no payments were required. This is what I would 
expect a lender to do when an account holder is experiencing payment problems so that a 
way forward for repayment of the debt can be fairly agreed. But Im satisfied that the 
customer care team confirmed that the conduct of the account would have a negative impact 
on Mr Cs credit file. 
So, overall, Im satisfied that Mr C was aware of the action NewDay had taken and the 
impact this and how the account had been managed would be reported on his credit file. Im 
also satisfied that NewDay was continuing to meet its obligations to treat Mr Cs financial 
problems positively and sympathetically.  
I cant see that Mr C returned the income and expenditure form at this stage. So, I dont think 
NewDay did anything wrong when it wrote to Mr C to notify him that it was registering the 
default of his account in March 2020. I note Mr C has said he had difficulty contacting NewDay due to the pandemic. But the 
Default Letter was sent prior to the UK lockdown. And I can see that Mr C contacted 
NewDay - in April 2020, to tell it that he was trying to obtain a loan from elsewhere to pay off 
the outstanding balance. But this was after the 30-day day hold had expired and the income 
and expenditure form had not been returned. And having listened to this call, I note Mr C 
mentioned receiving the Default Letter  so I think Mr C was aware of the action NewDay 
had taken. 
I can see that NewDay agreed a further payment holiday for one month. And the call 
recording confirms that NewDay explained this meant Mr Cs account would be frozen during 
this period. But it also explained that the payment holiday would expire on 6 May 2020  and 
that Mr C needed to contact it before this date to discuss next steps. It also explained that if 
the debt couldnt be repaid collection activity would recommence. 
Ultimately, it seems Mr C wasnt able to obtain a loan. But I note from NewDays records that 
a further repayment plan was agreed with Mr C. So, overall, I think Mr C was able to contact 
NewDay to discuss his account. If Mr C is unable to meet the terms of this arrangement, I 
would urge him to discuss the matter further with NewDay.  
I understand that the crux of this complaint is the default recorded on Mr Cs credit file, and 
that he wants the default removed. I can understand why Mr C would like NewDay to remove 
the default from his credit file - doing so may mean he would be able to successfully obtain a 
loan to repay the credit card balance. But I can only fairly ask NewDay to remove the default 
if it had been recorded incorrectly. And I think the information recorded accurately reflects 
the conduct of Mr Cs account. So, I cant say NewDay acted wrongly in recording this 
information.
  
Im sorry to disappoint Mr C as I do empathise with him  its clear hes been going through a 
difficult time. But, in this case, I think NewDay followed the regulations it is required to in 
such circumstances and that Mr C was aware of the action being taken. 
Overall, Im satisfied NewDay took a fair decision to terminate and subsequently default     
Mr Cs account in line with the terms of the account. Im afraid I havent found grounds to 
uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
