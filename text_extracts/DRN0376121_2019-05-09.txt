K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as Quick Quid  and Pounds 2 Pocket) 
irresponsibly lent to him. He wants a refund of the interest he paid and references removed 
from his credit file.
background
This complaint is about 22 payday  loans  and a flex credit loan (Quick Quid)  along with 2 
instalment loans (Pounds to Pocket)  provided  to Mr C between September 2011  and April 
2014. CashEuroNet objected to us looking at loans 1 to 7 due to the time passed  since  these 
were taken. Mr C agreed for us to not consider  these 7 loans. Mr C borrowed continuously  
from CashEuroNet and there were no significant gaps in his borrowing from loan 8 through 
to loan 25. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 8 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. CashEuroNet disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for 
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Like the adjudicator,  Ive not considered loans 1-7. I have looked into loans 8 to 25.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN03761212I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should  have realised  
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
By loan 8 Mr C had been borrowing  continuously and in quick succession from 
CashEuroNet. Mr C had requested 8 loans within a 7 month period.
When Mr C asked for loan 8, he was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling 
a previous one. So CashEuroNet ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not 
Mr C was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Quick  Quid and the 
amounts he tended  to borrow didnt decrease at all. Mr C had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to CashEuroNet over an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Quick  Quid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
Mr C had been requesting loans from CashEuroNet  for around 31 months  from loan 
1 to loan 25.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Cs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Cs complaint about  loans  8 to 25 and CashEuroNet should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN03761213putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 8 to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 25 should be removed from   
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Cs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr C compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 June 2019.
