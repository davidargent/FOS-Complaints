The complaint
Ms B complains that the loans she had from Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118
Money) were unaffordable.
  
What happened
Ms B had two loans from 118 118 Money between September 2014 and August 2017 as
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 18 Sep 2014 £2,000 24m £153.42 30 Aug 2016 6 Jun 2017
2 22 Aug 2017 £1,000 24m £76.27 1 Aug 2019 On time
Ms B says that she was already in a desperate situation when she applied for the 
118 118 Money loans and was trying to hide her spiralling debts from friends and family. 
She says 118 118 Money asked her about her income and expenditure, but never 
requested proof. Ms B says she missed a number of repayments and took on additional 
borrowing to settle the initial loan. She adds that her credit rating is still affected as a 
result.
118 118 Money says it asked Ms B about her income and expenditure, the reason for the 
loan and her employment details. It says it used industry standard verification checks and 
that Ms B was asked to confirm that she felt the repayments were affordable. 118 118 
Money says it also checked Ms Bs declared credit commitments against her credit file and 
was satisfied that the loan applications were correctly approved.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
118 118 Money carried out proportionate checks and that there was nothing to indicate the 
loan repayments were unsustainable.
Ms B responded to say, in summary, that it was unrealistic to expect a teenager to be able to 
budget with a disposable income of less than £200 as was the case for loan 1. She adds that 
she had limited credit available to her and her credit file would have indicated she was 
making minimum repayments.
Ms B explains that her credit file would also have shown shed taken out another loan to 
settle loan 1 and that her reliance on credit had increased when she applied for loan 2. 
She says that 118 118 Money should have queried the default on her credit file and more 
fully understood her financial situation before lending again.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Ms B and to 118 118 Money on 23 September 2021. The 
relevant rules and guidelines were outlined in the provisional decision, so I wont repeat 
them here.
I summarise my findings:
For loan 1 I couldnt see there was anything in the information 118 118 Money 
collected that indicated it should have carried out further checks or that the 
repayments were unaffordable to Ms B;
So I didnt conclude 118 118 Money did anything wrong by approving Ms Bs first 
loan;
For loan 2 118 118 Moneys checks showed:
oThe monthly repayments remained low at 6% of Ms Bs income;
oMs B settled loan 1 nine months late and missed several repayments in the 
process;
Ms Bs credit record showed significantly more borrowing:
She had taken out a £9,000 loan in June 2017;
Ms B now had three credit cards and the combined balance on them 
had almost doubled since loan 1, although shed cleared the balance 
on a mail order account;
There was a default that had been recorded in March 2016;
118 118 Money calculated Ms Bs disposable income to be around £490 per month;
I didnt find 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough for loan 2 because:
oMs B only made the first three payments towards loan 1 before she started 
having problems:
She had three payments returned between December 2014 and 
March 2015;
She made no payments between 1 June 2015 and 1 September 2016;
No further payments were made until she settled the loan on 6 June 
2017;
oMs B used a further loan to settle loan 1 (and an additional loan);
oAlthough the default was from March 2016, this suggests that Ms B was 
struggling financially during loan 1s term rather than the repayment issues 
being an oversight;
oMs B significantly understated credit commitments when asked about 
expenditure;
o118 118 Money used an estimate of 25% of income to calculate Ms Bs 
expenditure, excluding rent and credit commitments;
So, I was satisfied 118 118 Money should have ensured it fully understood Ms Bs 
financial situation before it approved loan 2 and I didnt find its checks went far 
enough at this stage;
Ms B subsequently provided her bank statements from the period which showed:
oHer income was roughly in line with the £1,300 shed declared;
oHer rental cost appeared to be £300 per month;oMs Bs credit commitments were £420 on a loan and three credit cards;
oHer regular monthly direct debits totalled about £200;
oThe combined spend on food and petrol was around £200;
oShe regularly incurred bank charges of about £20 per month.
Based on the above, Ms B would have been left with under £100 for unforeseen 
expenses. Given the loan term was 24 months, and shed be committing almost 40% 
of her income to credit repayments, I didnt consider loan 2 was sustainable for Ms B.
Taking all this into account, with Ms Bs repayment record and the default on her credit file, 
my provisional decision was that 118 118 Money was irresponsible to have approved loan 2.
Ms B did not respond but 118 118 Money said it accepted my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional information and 118 118 Money accepted my 
provisional decision, I find no reason to depart from it.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 
118 Money) should:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms B towards interest, fees 
and charges on loan 2;
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms B which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled;
C. Pay Ms B the total of A plus B;
D. Remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Bs credit file in relation to loan 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money should give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
