*At times,  Mr G had more than one loan outstanding when making his application  this figure is the 
total amount of Mr Gs repayments.
In our most recent view, our adjudicator thought the loans from loan four onwards shouldnt 
have been given. 
Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN33574862the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, by the time Mr G applied for his fourth  loan with Sunny, he 
already had three loans outstanding with them at the time which  had not been repaid. This 
shouldve alerted Sunny to the possibility that Mr G might have been having  problems 
managing his money and he would likely struggle repay these loans without needing  to 
borrow again. At this point, there  was also the risk that Mr G may have started  to show a 
reliance on this type of lending.  So, I dont  think this loan, or any other loans shouldve been 
provided.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
nine. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  their 
loans sustainably. Mr G had taken  out nine loans  within seven months  and Mr G had 
been indebted to Sunny for the whole time. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was 
more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Gs first loan was for £150 and loan nine was for £250   and his total monthly 
repayments were the largest they had ever been. At this point Sunny ought to have 
Ref: DRN33574863known that Mr G was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income 
but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  ten was 
taken out eight months after Mr Gs first. And although it was for the same amount as 
his first his monthly repayments were no the largest that they had been. Mr G had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan nine 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans for to eight and loans nine and ten and 
Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans four to ten;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  loans four to eight from Mr Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loans  nine and ten means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  nine and ten should be removed 
from Mr Gs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr G a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
