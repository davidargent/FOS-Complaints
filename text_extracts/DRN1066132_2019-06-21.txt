K820x#14complaint
Miss S says Bank of Scotland plc mis-sold  her a payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy.  
background
Miss S bought  the policy  in 2003  at the same time as taking  out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Miss S disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  [consumer name]s case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Ss complaint because:
 I think Bank of Scotland made Miss S aware  that the PPI was optional and that she 
chose to take it. I say this because  Miss S did tick the box on the credit card 
application form to show that she wanted the cover.
 Bank of Scotland didnt recommend the PPI to Miss S so it didnt have to check if it 
was suitable for her. That means  Bank  of Scotland didnt have to ask about any 
alternative means Miss S may have had to cover her repayments. It was for Miss S to 
decide whether  the PPI was suitable for her needs.
 Its possible the information Bank of Scotland gave Miss S about  the PPI wasnt  as 
clear as it should have been. But its unlikely Miss S would have been  affected by any 
of the main things  the policy didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and 
had a reasonable benefit. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped her 
buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 July 2019.
