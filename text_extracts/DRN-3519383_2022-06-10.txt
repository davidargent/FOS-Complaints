The complaint
Mr H complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused to refund him for a counterfeit item 
he purchased from an online marketplace 
What happened
Mr H says he purchased an item from an online marketplace. When he received it he 
realised the item was fake and contacted PayPal. 
PayPal asked Mr H to provide it with evidence the item was not as described and agreed to 
refund Mr H once he returned the item. 
Mr H believes PayPal treated him unfairly by repeatedly sending him the same standard 
acknowledgment email whenever he contacted it. 
PayPal said following receipt of Mr Hs claim on 13 November 2021 it asked him to return 
the item to the seller in order to receive a refund. Mr H declined to send the item back and so 
PayPal asked Mr H to provide information to support the item was counterfeit. During this 
time PayPal placed a claim limitation on Mr Hs account and so the claim was denied and no 
refund was issued. PayPal said a review of Mr Hs account found he had filed an excessive 
number of claims on his account, and so a limitation was applied. 
PayPal said it wrote to Mr H on 23 November 2021 in relation to filing excessive buyer 
claims. It explained there is a claim limitation on his account and as such it didnt uphold the 
complaint. As a gesture of goodwill PayPal offered to credit Mr Hs account with £28.90; the 
cost of the item he purchased.
Mr H indicated he accepted the offer but wanted additional compensation for PayPals failure 
to act within its terms and conditions. Mr H says the additional stress has made him ill. 
Mr H brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator looked into things for Mr H. He 
said the claim was dealt with in a timely manner and the offer from PayPal to refund the cost 
of the item was fair. Our investigator recommended Mr H accept the offer from PayPal. 
Mr H wasnt happy with the investigators view. He said he was told it was illegal to send 
counterfeit items through the post and he couldnt find a courier who would agree to send the 
item. Mr H also said PayPal didnt carry out a thorough investigation of his claim and says its 
policy says buyers are protected from counterfeit goods with no exception. 
And so the matter has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Counterfeit Item 
Ive considered whether PayPal acted in line with its user agreement during the dispute and 
claims process. And Im satisfied it did act in line with them when it declined the claim. 
PayPals terms and conditions say a buyer may be liable for a refund but may be required to 
return the item to the seller or other party.  PayPal asked Mr H to return the item to the 
seller as per its user agreement and Mr H declined to do so. Where the agreement wasnt 
adhered to Im satisfied PayPal were entitled to decline the claim made by Mr H. 
The terms go on to say, PayPal will make a final decision in its sole discretion based on 
eligibility requirements. And that is what it did.
Mr H has argued he wont post the item back to the seller because it is illegal. I havent seen 
any evidence to support what he is saying here. I note the investigator asked for evidence to 
show Mr H was unable to send the goods back but I cant see any was received. 
Mr H has also disagreed with PayPals investigation into his claim since it hasnt contacted 
the manufacturer of the bag. PayPal are entitled to conduct its investigation in whatever way 
it deems fit. Its role isnt to investigate general fraud, it is as a payment facilitator. And as 
such, under the terms of the agreement, it asked Mr H to return the item to the seller in order 
for it to process the refund. While I dont think PayPal acted unfairly here I am pleased to see 
its made a gesture of goodwill offer to Mr H to resolve matters. 
Emails from PayPal 
I can see Mr H received a number of standard acknowledgment emails in response to his 
contact with PayPal regarding his claim. I understand this would have been extremely 
frustrating for him but I cant say PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably here. Its not 
unusual for businesses to use standard acknowledgement emails. And Im satisfied those 
emails had no bearing on the progression of the claim. 
As a gesture of goodwill PayPal has offered to credit Mr Hs account with the money he paid 
for the item. So he wont be out of pocket following receipt of the counterfeit item. I think the 
offer is fair in the circumstances and as such I wont be recommending PayPal does any 
more to resolve the complaint for Mr H. 
My final decision
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has already made an offer to credit Mr Hs account with 
£28.90 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that PayPal should pay £28.90.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2022.
