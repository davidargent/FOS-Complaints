Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Vs complaint in part and thought the loans from February 2013 
(loan 4) onwards shouldnt have been  given. 247 Moneybox didnt  respond, and the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247 Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr V 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247 Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN16032682the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
247 Moneybox was required to establish whether  Mr V could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
do so without borrowing  further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Vs complaint.
The adjudicator didnt think 247 Moneybox  was wrong to lend loans 1 to 3 to Mr V. As Mr V 
hasnt disagreed with this, I dont think theres  an ongoing dispute about those loans. So Ive 
taken these loans  into account as part of Mr Vs borrowing history and have focussed my 
decision on loans 4 to 13.
247 Moneybox says that before it lent Mr V loan 3, it checked his income, and asked him 
about his short term credit commitments. It has also provided evidence  to show that it 
searched Mr Vs credit file before  lending.  But I dont  think 247 Moneyboxs checks went far 
enough before lending  loan 4. 
I say this because  this was now Mr Vs fourth  loan in as many months and the loan amount 
was the highest hed borrowed. Also, the results  of 247 Moneyboxs  credit checks  show  that 
Mr V had two defaults and two active county court judgments (CCJs).  Mr V had also opened  
18 accounts in the last six months and settled  52 accounts. I think  these factors suggest  that 
Mr V was likely having wider problems with his finances. So Before lending  this loan, I think 
247 Moneybox should  have carried out a detailed review of Mr Vs finances including 
verifying some of the information before lending. I cant see that it did this.
And had it done  this, its likely to have found that Mr V was regularly borrowing from other  
short term lenders  and at the time of loan 4, he had over £2,200 outstanding to other short 
term lenders. In the circumstances, Mr V couldnt afford the loan and 247 Moneybox 
shouldnt have lent him loan 4. I think  Mr V was in a similar situation  at the time of loans 5 
and 6 as he continued to borrow from several  other short term lenders. 247 Moneybox 
shouldnt have lent Mr V those loans either. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247 Moneyboxs lending history with Mr V to see if 
there was a point  at which 247 Moneybox  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
Ref: DRN16032683was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so 247 Moneybox  should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Vs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
at this point 247 Moneybox  ought to have  realised Mr V wasnt  managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr V had taken out 6 loans within 7 months,  so 247 Moneybox 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not he was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his finances and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably,
Mr Vs first loan was for £80 and loan 7 was for £680, more than eight times loan 1.  
247 Moneybox ought  to have  known that it was unlikely  Mr V was borrowing to meet 
a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need, 
from loan 7 onwards  Mr V was provided with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. On some  occasions he took out a new loan on the same day he settled 
a previous loan,
in the circumstances, I dont think Mr V was making any real inroads to the amount 
he owed 247 Moneybox. Loan 13 was taken out around two years after Mr Vs first. 
And it was for a larger  amount. Mr V had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to 247 Moneybox over an extended period.
And because 247 Moneybox continued lending to Mr V, I think he lost out. These  loans had 
the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Vs indebtedness  by allowing him to take expensive  credit 
intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. Also the number of loans Mr V 
borrowed was likely  to have had negative implications on his ability  to access  mainstream 
credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 6 and loans 7 onwards and 247 Moneybox  
should put things right.
putting things right  what 247 Moneybox needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr V paid on loans 4 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Vs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Vs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 247 Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247 Moneybox must give Mr V a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN16032684my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Vs complaint. Active Securities 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 December  2019.
