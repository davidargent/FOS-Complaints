K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that PDL Finance Limited,  trading as Mr Lender, gave him loans he couldnt
afford to repay.
background
In February 2019,  I sent both parties  my provisional  decision  in this case, an extract of which  
is attached and forms part of this final decision.  So, I wont repeat that here. 
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I intended to uphold  Mr Hs complaint in part and 
what Mr Lender  should  do to put matters right. Mr H accepted  my provisional decision  and 
had nothing further to add. Mr Lender said that there was nothing  in its credit  check to 
suggest that there were outstanding short term loans  at the point loans  3 and 4 and it was 
reasonable to lend loans  6-10 as a result of the checks carried out. It also said that it was 
unfair to remove the credit  file entries  as this would have the effect of treating the customer 
unfairly and out them  in a vulnerable position.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender hasnt provided me with anything that substantially alters matters  and has 
repeated its earlier arguments  so I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached  in 
my provisional decision.
 
I remain of the view that the checks Mr Lender  carried out before loans one and two were 
proportionate but that it should have done more before  loans three to ten. I think  that 
proportionate checks would have shown that Mr H could  afford  to repay  loan five but not 
loans three  and four or six to ten. 
I reviewed Mr Hs bank statements for these loans and based  my conclusions  on the 
outstanding short term borrowing that was due to be repaid which  made the loans 
unaffordable. I think that Mr Lender  needed to go further than relying  on its credit check  to 
establish the short term lending position, given the nature of short term borrowing and Mr Hs 
borrowing pattern. 
I dont agree that removing negative credit file entries places Mr H in a potentially vulnerable 
position. Mr H shouldnt  have been  given the loans so its not right that his credit file is 
negatively reported.  
 
To put matters right, Mr Lender  should refund interest and charges on loans three and 
four and six to ten, pay interest  on the refund and removed adverse information about 
those loans from  Mr Hs credit  file. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Hs complaint in 
part and direct PDL Finance, in addition to what its agreed to do for loan 11, to:
Ref: DRN98506382Refund all interest  and charges that Mr H paid on loans 3 and 4 and loans 6 -10;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*
Remove any negative  information about the refunded  loans from Mr Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL Finance Limited to take off tax from this interest.
PDL Finance  Limited must  give Mr H a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he
asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 May 2019.

The adjudicator recommended that Mr Hs complaint be upheld in part. He said Mr Lender should 
have carried out further checks on all loans after loan 3 and if it had, it would have seen that Mr H 
wouldnt have been able to afford the repayments on loans 3, 4 and 10. Mr H hadnt provided bank 
statements for the period when he took out loans  6-9 so the adjudicator wasnt able to say whether 
those loans were affordable. The business had offered to refund the interest on loan 11 in its final 
response letter so the adjudicator didnt  consider that loan.
Mr Lender responded  and said it agreed with the adjudicators view and made  an offer to settle Mr Hs 
complaint. It later said that the offer was made in error and it would like the case  to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman. It didnt  say what it disagreed with in the adjudicators view. Before the case was passed 
to me Mr H provided  the bank statements for the period when he took out loans 6-9 so I have been  
able to consider these  further in this decision.
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loan was offered.
I think  the overarching questions  I need  to consider  in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Mr Lender, at the time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way?
oIf not, would those  checks have shown that Mr H would have been able to do 
so.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was otherwise  unsustainable or harmful?
Ref: DRN98506384Did Mr Lender act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other way?
If I determine  that Mr Lender did not act fairly  and reasonably in its dealings with Mr H and that he has 
lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what is fair compensation. Like the adjudicator, I agree that 
it is fair and reasonable to refund the interest in relation to loan 11 and I havent considered  within this 
decision whether it was right to give Mr H this loan.
Mr Lender was required  to lend responsibly. It needed  to make checks to see whether  Mr H could  
afford to pay back the loans before  it lent to him. Those checks needed to be proportionate to things 
such as the amount Mr H was borrowing  and the length of the agreement. But there was no set list of 
checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Mr Lender says it asked about Mr Hs income  which he declared as £1400 and his expenses which he 
declared as £965. It also carried out a credit  check on each occasion. It says the checks it carried  out 
were proportionate.
For loans 1 and 2 I agree with the adjudicator  that the checks carried out by Mr Lender were enough. 
I say this because the amounts Mr H needed to repay compared to his declared monthly income were  
relatively modest. The credit check didnt reveal anything that would  suggest  further checks were 
needed and Mr H repaid  his first two loans on time and without apparent difficulty before he asked for 
the second loan.
At the point of loan 3 I think Mr Lender should have been doing more  to find out why Mr H needed to 
borrow so often  and to check he wasnt reliant on this sort of credit. This was his third loan without a 
significant break in the borrowing and the amounts Mr H was borrowing were  steadily increasing  to a 
significant proportion  of his declared disposable income. I think Mr Lender should  have seen this and 
sought further  information  about  Mr Hs monthly expenditure and regular financial commitments.  In 
particular it should have asked Mr H if he had any other short term lending. If it had done this, it would  
have seen that Mr H had no disposable income at the time of this loan to be able to meet the 
repayments as he had other  short term lending to repay. So I dont think Mr Lender should have 
agreed to lend Mr H 
loan 3. The position was the same for loan 4 
By the time Mr H applied for loan 5, I think  that by this stage it wasnt safe to rely on what  
Mr H was saying about his finances.  So in addition  to asking about Mr Hs income and outgoings  and 
short term lending,  I think Mr Lender should have been looking to carry out a complete review of Mr 
Hs finances from loan 5 onwards. One way it could  have done  this would  be to look at his bank 
statements. If it had done this, it would have seen that in some months he had a high amount of 
financial commitments including  other short term lending. When these  additional  amounts are 
considered alongside Mr Hs normal  living costs, he had no disposable  income for loans  6 to 10 and 
didnt have enough to afford the loan repayments. It follows that Mr Hs loans from loan 6-10 werent 
sustainable. Mr Hs income and expenditure for the period when he took out loan 5 was such that 
even if Mr Lender had done the checks Ive suggested, this loan would still have been affordable. 
Taking everything into account I dont think Mr Lender has shown its checks for loans  3-10 were 
sufficient or proportionate  given Mr Hs borrowing history or, the amounts borrowed. I consider 
proportionate checks would have shown  Mr Lender that Mr H couldnt  afford  to repay loans 3 and 4 or 
loans 6 -10. On balance I dont think these loans  shouldve been granted. It should  put right what it did 
wrong.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I intend to uphold this complaint in part and direct PDL Finance, in 
addition to what its agreed to do for loan 11, to:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr H paid on loans 3 and 4 and loans 6 -10;
Ref: DRN98506385Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
Remove any negative information about the refunded loans from Mr Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  PDL Finance Limited  to take off tax from this interest.  PDL Finance 
Limited must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
