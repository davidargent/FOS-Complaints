The complaint
A company Ill call T complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) declined to 
open a Euro currency account, and wouldnt explain why.
T is represented by its director, Mr M, who wants to know why NatWest declined the 
application.
What happened
Mr M told our service that T had banked with NatWest for a number of years, and that he 
wanted to open a Euro account for T to receive payments in Euros for Ts business, and to 
minimise currency exchange losses. He said NatWests decision to decline the application 
had cost T a substantial amount of money, and that he wanted a Euro account with NatWest 
so all of Ts banking services were under one roof.
NatWest issued its final response to Ts complaint on 24 August 2022. It said it was satisfied 
Ts application had been processed correctly, and said it doesnt disclose the reason for its 
declinations to ensure re-applicants cant simply circumvent its security procedures. Mr M 
remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked at the complaint, but she didnt uphold it. She was satisfied NatWest 
had acted fairly in declining the application, and she accepted it wasnt obliged to share the 
reasons for its decision.
Mr M didnt accept what our investigator said, so he asked for an Ombudsman to review the 
matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the reasons NatWest declined to open a Euro account for T to make sure it 
treated T fairly. NatWest is entitled to choose who it does business with, but it must follow 
the correct procedure when it declines applications, and it must treat customers fairly when 
doing so.
Having reviewed the information NatWest has provided our service, Im satisfied it was 
entitled to decline Ts application. And I accept NatWest gave a reasonable explanation as to 
why it cant disclose the reasons behind its decision. So, I wont ask it to explain its 
reasoning to T. 
I appreciate it must be frustrating for Mr M to not know why NatWest declined Ts 
application, but NatWest isnt obliged to disclose the reasons for its decision to T. So, I cant 
say it did anything wrong by not telling Mr M why it declined Ts application. And so, it follows 
that I wont ask NatWest to pay compensation or take any further action.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2023.
