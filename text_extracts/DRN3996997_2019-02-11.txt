K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that the loans he had from Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as 
Sunny.co.uk) were unaffordable.
background
Mr D had six loans from Sunny between May 2016  and November 2016 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 28 May 2016 £200 6m £64.05 30 Nov 2016 21 Jul 2016
2 3 Jun 2016 £200 6m £61.81 30 Nov 2016 23 Jul 2016
3 5 Aug 2016 £250 6m £76.19 31 Jan 2017 24 Aug 2016
4 27 Aug 2016 £200 6m £64.39 28 Feb 2017 31 Oct 2016
5 23 Sep 2016 £250 6m £81.60 31 Mar 2017 31 Jan 2017
6 3 Nov 2016 £250 6m £76.95 28 Apr 2017 31 Jan 2017
Mr D says Sunny didnt carry out enough  checks before approving his loans. He says that 
his continual reliance  on such  borrowing should have indicated potential  financial difficulty 
and, if Sunny had done better  checks,  his applications would have  been  declined.
Sunny says it carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks  and did not consider it 
was irresponsible  to approve the loans.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. Although he considered 
Sunny should  have  carried out further checks  for loans 4, 5 and 6, he found  that better 
checks were unlikely  to have changed Sunnys view on the affordability  of loan 4. He was 
unable to say what better  checks would have  shown for loans 5 and 6, as Mr D hadnt 
provided any further information about his financial circumstances at the time.
Mr D responded to say, in summary, that Sunny encouraged him to take further borrowing, 
that he had up to three loans at the same time and that, in December 2016, he was 
struggling to pay so a repayment plan was agreed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure Mr D 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr D was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
Loans 1 to 4
Mr D declared  his income to be £1,700 and his calculated disposable income was at least  
£475 over the period. Sunny also checked  Mr Ds credit file. I consider these checks went  far 
enough. I say that because  the monthly  repayments were a small proportion of Mr Ds 
income  even though loans 1 and 2 overlapped, the maximum scheduled repayment was 
under £130.  Mr Ds repayment history was good and Sunny found nothing  in his credit file to 
indicate financial difficulty. So Im satisfied it didnt  need to do any more checks  and, based 
on the information it had, I cant conclude it was wrong to approve loans 1 to 4.
Ref: DRN39969972Loans 5 and 6
By the time Mr D applied  for his fifth loan, I consider Sunny should have carried out better  
checks. Mr D had no significant breaks  in his borrowing and loan 4 was still outstanding at 
the time.  Although his maximum repayment was still less than £150, I still think Mr Ds 
ongoing borrowing  should  have indicated to Sunny that he may have been in financial 
difficulties. So I think a full financial review would be proportionate here,  including  specific 
questions about  other  short-term loans.
Similarly, loan 5 was still outstanding  when  Mr D applied for loan 6, so I also consider a full 
financial review would  have been  proportionate  before Sunny made  the decision to approve 
this loan.
However, in the case of loans 5 and 6, I cannot  say what a full financial review would have 
shown Sunny. That is because, despite  several requests, Mr D hasnt provided any evidence  
of his financial circumstances  at the time. That said, I have looked at Mr Ds credit file and, 
although there are a number of reported  defaults, they are from 2013 and 2014 and all are 
marked as Satisfied in 2014. So I dont  consider there is anything  on there that should have 
precluded Sunny from approving loans  in 2016.
I acknowledge what Mr D says about  Sunny  encouraging him to borrow  additional money,  
but that doesnt affect my findings on whether the loans were affordable. I acknowledge Mr D 
did have two concurrent loans on a number  of occasions (although not three),  but I still found 
the repayments to be affordable based  on the available information.
Finally, I accept Mr D says he told Sunny  about  his financial difficulties in December 2016 
but, as that was after the sixth loan had been approved,  I cant  conclude it should  have 
affected Sunnys  lending  decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2019.
