K820x#14complaint
Miss G complains  about the short term loans she took out with Provident  Personal Credit 
Limited trading  as Satsuma. Miss G says that Satsuma has lent to her irresponsibly. She 
says she had serious financial problems and she was borrowing repeatedly from Satsuma 
and other  lenders. She says her lending patterns shouldve caused Satsuma to realise this 
and not lend to her. 
background
Miss G took out six instalment loans between November  2013 and May 2016. Some  of the 
information Satsuma  has given us is shown in the table below: 
Loan 
numberdate startedamount  
borrowedterm date ended payments
1 09/11/2013 £130.00 13 weeks 20/12/2013 £14.00 weekly
2 23/12/2013 £300.00 26 weeks* 27/12/2013 £19.38 weekly
3 27/05/2015 £300.00 6 months 02/06/2015 £85.00 monthly
4 02/06/2015 £230.00 13 weeks 04/06/2015 £24.77 weekly
5 06/06/2015 £280.00 13 weeks 19/11/2015 £30.15 weekly
6 30/05/2016 £300.00 17 weeks outstanding £27.62 weekly
*Satsuma says that loan 2 had a term of one week. But looking at the weekly repayments 
and the total amount due to be repaid  I think its more likely it had a term of 26 weeks.  
Satsuma has looked at Miss Gs complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for loans 1 to 6. And these checks showed that the lending was 
affordable. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Miss G and Satsuma said.  She thought that Satsuma 
had made  proportionate  checks  for loans 1 to 6. So she thought that Satsumas decisions to 
lend were reasonable. She thought Miss Gs complaint  shouldnt  be upheld.
Miss G didnt  agree with our adjudicator. She said that she ended up struggling  after 
borrowing from Satsuma in 2013.  But it lent to her again in 2015 and 2016. So as no 
agreements been  reached the complaints been passed to me to me to issue  a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.  
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Miss Gs complaint. Ill explain why.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether they will be able to repay what theyre  borrowing  in a sustainable manner. A lender 
should gather enough  information for it to be able to make an informed  decision on the 
lending. The lending shouldnt adversely impact  a consumers  financial  situation. 
Ref: DRN18044082The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
So Ive firstly looked at whether Satsuma performed proportionate checks.  If I think that the 
checks were proportionate then it usually wouldve been reasonable for it to lend. But if 
Satsuma didnt do proportionate checks Ive looked  at whether it wouldve been apparent to 
it that the loan repayments were affordable had it done better  checks. Satsuma should put 
things right if its likely to have then found that the loan repayments were  unaffordable.  
Satsuma says it: 
found out what Miss Gs income and expenditure was before it lent each time. It says 
this showed that Miss G had a disposable income of between  around £700 and 
£1,000 each time it lent; and
it performed checks with credit reference  agencies to ensure the information it had 
gathered was accurate; and
it adjusted the amounts  Miss G had declared to take into account the information it 
received from the credit reference  agency.  It adjusted Miss Gs disposable income  to 
between £350  to £550 for loans 3 to 6
And based on what it saw it thought it reasonable to lend to Miss G.
why I think Satsumas checks  were  proportionate 
For loan 1 Miss G needed to repay  £14 a week for around 3 months. She repaid this loan in 
full in just over six weeks. She took out loan 2 straight after this and was due to repay  just 
under £20 a week  for 26 weeks. This loan was repaid in just under a week.  
Ive seen a record  of the information Miss G provided when  she completed her loan 
applications. Miss G said she had a monthly  income  of around £1,300 and she had regular 
monthly outgoings of £600. This left her with enough disposable income to repay these 
loans. 
So whilst these were longer term commitments  I think the repayments were relatively low 
compared to Miss Gs disposable income. So I think Satsumas checks were  proportionate 
given the amount borrowed and the repayments  in relation to what Miss G declared as her 
monthly disposable income. So I dont think Satsuma was wrong to approve  loans 1 and 2. 
There was a gap of around  6 months between  loans 2 and 3.  So it would be reasonable for 
Satsuma to think that Miss Gs financial situation  may have improved. Miss G took out three 
longer term loans in a relatively short time. She repaid the first two quickly  and then took out 
loan 5. The amounts, scheduled repayments and the terms werent  very much  different from 
loans 1 and 2. 
So I again  think the repayments  werent large compared to Miss Gs disposable income. So 
I dont think further  checks were needed before Satsuma approved  loans 3, 4 and 5. 
Ref: DRN18044083And lastly  loan 6 was taken out over six months  after loan 5 was repaid. So again it would be 
reasonable for Satsuma to think that Miss Gs financial situation  had improved. The 
payments and term werent  significantly different  from earlier  so it would also be reasonable 
for Satsuma  to think they were affordable. 
Miss G has said that she had some financial problems. She says that Satsuma shouldve 
found out about these  and not lent to her. She mentions she was in a debt management 
plan in 2012, she defaulted on a credit card in 2013 and an arrangement to repay loan 5. 
But Satsuma  did take into account  the information  it reviewed on the credit file.  And, it 
reduced Miss Gs income to account  for the other credit she had and any other issues it saw 
on the credit  file. I also think the gaps in the lending mean it would be reasonable for 
Satsuma to think that Miss G was not reliant on short term lending.  
And I havent seen  any further information  that shows  its likely Satsuma was made aware  of 
any further financial problems Miss G mightve  been having. Or anything that wouldve 
prompted it to investigate her circumstances further.
So I think Satsuma did enough here.  And I think its decisions to lend for loans  1 to 6 were 
reasonable and Im not upholding Miss Gs complaint about  them.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Miss Gs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 February  2019.
