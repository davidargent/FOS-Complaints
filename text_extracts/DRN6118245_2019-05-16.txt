K820x#14complaint
Mr G has complained about the amount  Madison CF UK Limited (trading  as 118 118 
Money) has offered him in respect of a rebate of interest for early  settlement of a loan.
background
Mr G took out a loan for £1,700 with 118 118 Money in August 2017  It was repayable over 
two years.  He agreed to pay interest totalling  £1,499.48. The monthly payments on the loan 
were £133.32.
In February 2019  Mr G asked 118 118 Money  to let him know  the amount  he would have to 
pay to repay  the loan in full at that time. 118 118 Money told him hed need  to pay £749.68. 
Mr G complained to 118 118 Money that the settlement figure  hed been given only gave him 
a rebate of £50 24 on the interest he would have had to pay if he didnt repay  the loan early.
118 118 Money didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. It said it had calculated a full settlement 
figure in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement and the relevant 
regulations. Mr G wasnt happy with 118 118 Moneys response and referred his complaint 
to this service.
our initial conclusions
Our investigator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think  there  
was any evidence to show 118 118 Money  had calculated the settlement figure  incorrectly.
Mr G didnt accept our investigators findings. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The monthly payments  on personal loan agreements are calculated so that, if the payments 
are all made on time, the capital and interest will be repaid  in full at the end of the term. But, 
although the monthly repayments are always the same amount, they, arent made up of the 
same proportions of capital and interest  throughout the term.
In the first few months of the term most of the capital  will still be outstanding. The interest is 
calculated on the outstanding balance  of the capital  so it will make  up a large  proportion  of 
the monthly repayment. Conversely, at the end of the term most of the capital will have been 
repaid. At that time the proportion of interest  will be much smaller. If a loan is repaid in full 
towards the end of the term, the rebate of interest  will be the amount of interest  that would 
have been included in the remaining  monthly  instalments. This will be quite small compared 
to the total interest payable.
118 118 Money provided Mr G with a statement when he asked  about  early settlement. This 
shows how each monthly payment  is divided  between capital and interest during the term 
The proportions are what I would  expect to see. I havent seen any evidence  to suggest 
theyve been incorrectly calculated.
Ref: DRN61182452The terms and conditions  of the loan say 118 118 Money can charge 58 days  interest on the 
amount repaid. This will also reduce the amount of any rebate. Im satisfied 118 118 Money 
has calculated the full settlement figure  it gave  Mr G in accordance  with the terms and 
conditions and the regulations that govern this type of loan.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is I dont uphold  this complaint. I make no 
award against Madison CF UK Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 June  2019.
