K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains about how National Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt  with her 
request to withdraw  money from her account.
background
Miss M says she wanted to withdraw £10,000  from her account and so contacted NatWest in 
advance. She says she attended the NatWest branch with identification  but was told she 
couldnt withdraw the amount she wanted.  Miss M says she spent some time in the branch 
being spoken to by NatWest staff and the police were then called. She says she was 
humiliated and caused stress by what happened and questions if this will take place for 
future cash withdrawals.
NatWest says Miss Ms request was unusual  for her and it had security  concerns. It accepts 
that Miss M would have  been caused  distress and has apologised but says its acted in Miss 
Ms best interests. NatWest has paid Miss M £30 compensation and send her flowers.
Miss M brought her complaint to us but our adjudicator thought NatWest had dealt with it 
fairly. He thought  NatWest had a duty to protect  its customers money but accepted  Miss M 
would have been caused distress. The adjudicator didnt think it was our role to tell NatWest  
what its security  measures should be and didnt think NatWests actions were unreasonable  
in the circumstances.
Miss M doesnt accept  that view.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the adjudicator for the same reasons. I realise Miss M will be disappointed by 
my decision.
Ive no doubt this must have been a very stressful and distressing experience for Miss M to 
have found herself  in being questioned by the police  and NatWests staff. I appreciate her 
concern that this was her money  and of course  she was free to do what she liked with it. But 
I also accept that banks and building societies  have to make  sure that its customers money 
is protected and that they do not find themselves the victim of fraud.  I appreciate that on 
occasions security measures can cause inconvenience even if a transaction is legitimate.
Im satisfied that NatWest  had reasonably  held concerns here as this was a large cash  
withdrawal which was unusual compared  to Miss Ms usual transactions.  In those 
circumstances I dont  think  it made a mistake  by questioning Miss M about it and by calling 
the police  when those concerns remained. Im satisfied its intention  was to make sure Miss 
M wasnt  the victim  of fraud or of a different crime. I accept that Miss M had to wait some 
time for the police to arrive and that NatWest could have handled this matter  more 
sympathetically. But I can see that NatWest has acted fairly and reasonably by accepted that 
and by paying her what  I think is a fair and reasonable  amount of compensation and by 
sending her flowers. 
I appreciate Miss Ms concerns about  future withdrawals but I make clear  to Miss M that Im 
only dealing  with her complaint  from February  2019.  And I also make clear  that we are not 
the regulator of banks  and building societies so I cant  fairly  tell a business  what its security

NatWest has acted  unfairly here but I recognise how difficult this experience  was for Miss M.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
