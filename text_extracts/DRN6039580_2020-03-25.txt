There was a gap of around  seven months  between  the time Miss R repaid  loan 9 and took 
out loan 10, so, Ive treated this as two separate  chains  of borrowing.
 
In its final response Sunny said that the loans were assessed as affordable over the term of 
the loans and it did not uphold Miss Rs complaint. Later it revised  its position  and offered to 
partially uphold  Miss Rs complaint from the time it gave her loan 19 amounting  to £260.26.
Our adjudicator couldnt say it was unfair for Sunny  to give Miss R loans 1-5. But he upheld 
Miss Rs complaint about loan 6 onwards. He said by this time Miss Rs overall pattern of 
borrowing suggested she had become  persistently reliant on short  term loans. Sunny 
Ref: DRN60395802disagreed with this view but re- looked  at its previous offer and said it would put things  right 
by making an offer of £474.27  in relation to loan 12 onwards and update Miss Rs credit file. 
Miss R did not accept this offer. 
The case  was then reviewed before  it came to me. The adjudicator  said that she had come 
to a slightly different  outcome than the first adjudicator.  This time she told the parties  that 
she had reviewed all the information and she didnt  have  enough  to say it was unfair to lend 
loans 1-5 or loans 10 and 11. But loans 6-9 should  be upheld. By loans  6 Sunny should 
have been alerted to the possibility that Miss R might have been having  problems  managing 
money. She did not review loans 12-23 which Sunny had already  made  an offer for and 
Sunny should  also put things right for these loans. As the parties  are not in agreement the 
complaint has been passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss R could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss R could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
Ref: DRN60395803meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Rs complaint. I agree with our second  adjudicators  
view and Ive decided  to uphold this complaint for loan 6 -9. I will explain  why.
Neither party has disagreed with what our adjudicator said in respect of loans 1 to 5. Just to 
be clear,  for loans 1 to 5, I think Sunny was entitled to rely on the information Miss R 
provided when  it decided whether to agree her loans. And from the information provided, I 
havent seen anything to suggest the repayments wouldnt have been sustainably  affordable.  
And Sunny has also offered to put things right for loans 12-23. So, I will not look at these 
loans either  but Sunny  should  put things right as set out below in relation to these loans as 
well.
Looking at loan 6-9, I agree with our second  adjudicators view and Ive decided  to uphold 
this complaint for loan 6 -9. I will explain why.
By the time Miss R borrowed loan 6 she already  had loans 3,4 and 5 outstanding. When  she 
took out loan 3, she borrowed  £400  and subsequently kept borrowing smaller  sums even 
though she hadnt yet repaid loan 3. When she took out loan 6 Miss Rs expenditure had 
also gone up - to £1,043 which left her with little money per month with which to repay 
unforeseen expenses and I think  at this point and for loans 7,8 and 9 Sunny should  have 
realised that Miss R was probably having  problems  managing money.
Miss R didnt borrow again from Sunny for a period of around 7 months. Miss R then took 
out loan 10 and 11. At this point  I think there  was enough of a gap for Sunny to assume  that 
Miss Rs financial position  might have improved. And I think  the checks  it did were  probably 
enough. From the information Ive seen it shows that Miss Rs expenditure had gone down 
so I cant say that Sunny would have thought loans 10 and 11 werent affordable.
And as I said above Sunny has agreed  to uphold Miss Rs loan 12 onwards so I havent re- 
considered these loans but Sunny should  put things right as set out below.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about 6-9 and loans 12-23 and Sunny should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN60395804putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss R paid on loans 6-9 and loans 12-23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 6-9 and loans 12-16 from Miss Rs 
credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loans  17 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  17-23  should be removed from 
Miss Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 April 2020.
