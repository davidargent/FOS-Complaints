The complaint
Mr F isnt happy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA delayed releasing the funds he was 
due to receive from selling an item online. 
What happened
Mr F sold an item online and the buyer paid £2,350 into his PayPal account on 28 
September 2019. But PayPal placed a restriction on Mr Fs account, so he couldnt access 
the funds. When he queried this, PayPal sent an automated email giving some possible 
reasons why the account was blocked. Mr F tried to follow the instructions given but, he had 
difficulties doing so. He contacted PayPal again but received the same automated response. 
He tried calling PayPal on 30 September and again on 3 October 2019 but, after holding 
nearly three and a half hours, he wasnt able to speak to anyone. 
Mr F says that he wasnt told about any limit that applied to his account or when hed receive 
his money. He feels the support he was offered was poor.
PayPal have told us that Mr Fs account was subject to a Compliance Limitation. This  
required them to gather information about any payment thats over 2,500 Euros, or the 
currency equivalent. The amount Mr F received meant PayPal had to request certain 
information from him. Mr F provided the requested information on 18 December 2019. And 
he was then able to access the funds. PayPal felt theyd acted correctly so didnt uphold Mr 
Fs complaint.
Our investigator considered the case and thought that PayPal could have provided Mr F a 
better level of service. He agreed PayPal were entitled to restrict access to the funds while 
they waited for Mr F to provide the requested information. But he felt the automated nature 
of PayPals responses wasnt helpful. So he recommended PayPal pay Mr F £60 
compensation to make up for this.
PayPal didnt accept our investigators recommendation and dont agreed that any 
compensation is appropriate. In summary, they've said :
The automated email Mr F received had a contact us link which he could have used 
to contact them. After clicking on this link, he would have been given the option to 
call them.
They have no record of Mr F calling them. But if he was on hold for the amount for 
time he claims on 30 September 2019 and 3 October 2019, they apologise, but say 
this was outside their control.
Mr F didnt contact them again until 11 November 2019. They provided him with a 
link so he could provide the information they needed.
Mr F provided the information on 18 December 2019 and the restriction was lifted the 
same day.
Had Mr F contacted them directly sooner, this situation could have been resolved. 
They also offer a live chat service that Mr F could have used.
 The case has now come to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at PayPals reasons for restricting access to the account, and I think these were 
reasonable, as they acted in accordance with their User Agreement. Ive also considered 
whether PayPal made it difficult for Mr F to provide the information needed to gain access to 
the funds. 
Mr F initially emailed PayPal on 29 September 2019 saying he couldnt complete the form 
hed been asked to complete. An automated response sent the same day gave possible 
reasons why the account had been blocked. And said that if the suggested actions didnt 
give Mr F access to his funds, he could use the contact us function. But he's told us 
he couldnt do this as the Next button, on the email he received, wasnt working. 
Mr F sent a further email on 3 October 2019. He explained the problem he had again, adding 
that hed tried to call but hadnt been able to get through. He asked again what he needed to 
do to access his account. PayPal sent the same automated response hed received on 29 
September 2019.  Mr F sent a further undated email which said he hadnt been given any 
information about the restriction or how long it would remain in place. 
In his emails Mr F clearly explained his problem. PayPals automated responses didnt help 
him gain access to his funds or explain why he couldnt access his account. They just 
provided some general information about why problems could arise.
Mr F has told us about his attempts to speak to PayPal over the phone. Hes said he 
originally called PayPal on 30 September 2019 at 10.00. After going through the automated 
service, he was asked to hold the line. He was on hold until 12.40, before hanging up. He 
called again on 7 October 2019 at 14.30 and was on hold until 15.20. He called again on 11 
October 2019 at 14.20 and was on hold until 15.50. 
Having tried everything he could think of, Mr F took a break from trying to resolve this 
situation, because he felt it was affecting his mental health and sleep pattern. 
When Mr F felt able to try and resolve the issue again, he was able to locate a number for 
PayPal. And fortunately he was able to speak to someone. After this call Mr F received an 
email on 11 November 2019 with a link allowing him to submit the information that PayPal 
needed. He had to do this a second time as PayPal needed it in colour, rather than in black 
and white. 
But PayPal still didnt release Mr Fs money. Mr F had to make three further calls to them. 
The first person he spoke to confirmed the documents had been received, but they didnt 
have authority to release the funds. It took two further calls before it was confirmed that he 
could access his funds.
Im persuaded that Mr F was taking reasonable steps to try to resolve the situation. I can see 
that he would have been frustrated by the automated nature of PayPals responses, and the 
number and length of the calls needed before he could access his money.
PayPal have said that Mr F could have used the chat service to contact them. And that they 
arent responsible for how long it took before Mr F could speak to them. Given the difficulty 
Mr F had using email to resolve his problem, I can see why he wanted to speak to them. While PayPal have no control over the volume of calls they receive, Mr F tried to speak to 
them on five occasions, without being able to resolve this matter. 
I accept that Mr F found his dealings with PayPal time-consuming and distressing. So I think 
hes due some compensation for the trouble and upset he experienced. And I think £60 is 
the appropriate amount.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above my final decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint against 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. 
And to put things right I require them to pay Mr F £60 compensation for the trouble and 
upset hes experienced.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2020.
