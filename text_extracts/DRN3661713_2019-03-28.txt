K820x#14complaint
Mr W says Barclays  Bank  UK Plc (Barclays) mis-sold him First Additions and Additions  
Plus packaged bank accounts.  Hes used a Claims Management Company  (CMC) to 
complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ws complaint  and didnt  think  Barclays  had mis-sold  the 
packaged accounts. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ws complaint. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Mr W 
wouldve known this as he had one with Barclays prior to having  the packaged accounts. 
The information Ive seen on Mr Ws circumstances  suggest he was eligible for and couldve 
used the main benefits included on the First Additions and Additions Plus accounts. And 
while Im open to the possibility Mr W wasnt provided with absolutely everything  he 
shouldve been,  I havent seen anything  to suggest clearer  information  wouldve changed  his 
decision to take the accounts in the first place. So, in these circumstances, Im not upholding 
the complaint.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 April 2019.
