The complaint
Mr M complains about the service he has received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA. In 
particular the length of time it took for his queries to be dealt with, a letter regarding his 
account being sent to the wrong address, and PayPal holding payments temporarily without 
authorisation. 
What happened
Mr M says PayPal wrote to him at his parents address. The letter was regarding his credit 
limit but Mr M says the credit limit was incorrect. Mr M says he no longer lives at his parents 
address and he had told PayPal of the new address when he moved. 
Mr M tried to contact PayPal via its chat function but wasnt able to get through to anyone as 
the wait time kept changing. Mr M says its been incredibly frustrating trying to deal with 
PayPal in order to ascertain whether he has a credit account open he wasnt aware of. 
Mr M says he sold items on an online marketplace and PayPal put his funds on hold. Mr M 
says he sold the items in order to help his family during the pandemic. He says PayPal 
withheld his money without authorisation and refused to release it. 
Mr M is also unhappy his complaint to PayPal wasnt acknowledged despite numerous 
attempts to chase it up. He would like to be compensated for time wasted trying to deal with 
the issues. 
PayPal said Mr M had a PayPal credit account with them which he opened in March 2018. It 
had a credit limit of Â£700 and was closed in January 2019. PayPal said it is required to send 
a final annual statement when an account has been closed. And so its system sent one to 
the address on that account  which was his parents address.  When Mr M contacted 
PayPal it explained what had happened. 
With regards to the length of time it took PayPal to respond to his online chat messages and 
emails, it said at the time it had moved its workforce to work from home due to the 
pandemic. And so it was unable to provide full support on the phone lines which led to an 
increased volume of contact for online chat and email channels. 
PayPal said it placed some of Mr Ms sales on hold, which is normal practice, in order to 
create a safer online payment community if there is a higher than average risk associated 
with the payment in question. PayPal said if there are no issues with the payments then they 
are released. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its important to note my role here is to look at whether PayPal has acted within its terms and 
conditions and treated Mr M fairly and reasonably. I am not able to address the wider issues 
of how PayPal organise its internal processes as thats not my role. 
Letter to incorrect address 
PayPal sent Mr M a letter regarding his PayPal credit account but it was sent to his parents 
address. In that letter was details of his credit limit. The account it referred to is a previously 
held account with PayPal under a different email address. And so when Mr M says he 
notified PayPal of the change of address its likely he did so on his current PayPal account 
and not the previous one. 
PayPal explained it had to send that letter since there was a refund on the account which 
qualified as recent activity and so it is required to send a final annual statement. 
The credit account was registered to a different email address and is therefore dealt with as 
a separate account. Since the address on the account was Mr Ms parents Im satisfied 
PayPal have not done anything wrong here.
Holding payments
Ive considered what Mr M has said about PayPal holding his money and about his personal 
circumstances. And while this would have been a frustrating time for Mr M I cant say PayPal 
were unreasonable in not releasing his funds when he wanted it to. I say this because under 
its user agreement PayPal can withhold transactions. So Mr M would have been aware at 
the outset he may not be able to access his funds for a period of time. And although Mr M 
may have been suffering financial difficulties at the time Im not persuaded it was 
unreasonable for PayPal to do so based on the user agreement conditions which Mr M 
agreed to when opening his accounts. 
PayPal has important legal and regulatory obligations it must meet. Those obligations are 
ongoing and dont only apply when an account is opened. They can be broadly summarised 
as a responsibility to protect persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial 
crime. 
PayPals user agreement also says it may hold on to the funds where PayPal considers 
there to be a higher than average risk associated with the payment. So I dont think PayPal 
was unfair to do so here where it held such concerns. I have seen evidence of PayPal 
explaining to Mr M his funds would be released 24 hours after the tracking information is 
uploaded. So it did explain to Mr M when he would likely receive his money.  
Response times 
Mr M has said the wait times for the live chat changed regularly and werent accurate. He 
says it took a long time to get through to someone and PayPal provided a false expectation 
of when he would be responded to. And this caused unnecessary stress for him
I understand Mr Ms frustration. PayPal have explained at the time its workforce was working 
from home due to the pandemic. And this meant its phone lines werent open so caused an 
increase in volume of live chat contact. This meant it took longer to deal with customer 
queries however I can see PayPal did respond to the issues Mr M raised; albeit not as 
quickly as he would have liked. 
Complaints handlingI know Mr M feels very strongly he should be awarded compensation as a result of the way 
PayPal dealt with his complaint. And I can understand why he is unhappy. 
We arent free to deal with every complaint we receive. Were bound by our rules  which in 
turn flow from legislation  that set out the types of complaints we can look at. Those rules 
are maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and are published in the FCAs 
Handbook; under the heading DISP.
Section 2 of DISP sets out the jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service. it includes 
definitions of who is eligible to bring a complaint to us. In broad terms, a person needs to be 
a customer of the business and be complaining about something in relation to what is called 
a regulated activity. Regulated activities are incorporated into DISP. 
Mr M is clearly a customer of PayPal. However the event being complaint about goes to how 
PayPal handled the complaint about the withheld transactions. I previously said regulated 
activities are incorporated into DISP; the activity of handling a complaint isnt amongst them. 
as a result a complaint about the way a business and dealt with a complaint isnt something 
which falls within the scope of our rules. 
That means under our rules we have no power to consider how PayPal addressed the 
complaint. I dont want Mr M to think its down to a technicality, or I dont understand his 
frustration. I can only work with the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, and if I were 
to decide the merits of this aspect of his complaint, I would be acting outside my statutory 
powers. Any decision I reached would have no standing and PayPal could quite legitimately 
disregard it. 
I have looked at the circumstances of this complaint as a whole. But in order to uphold Mr 
Ms complaint I would need to see PayPal acted outside of its user agreement. This is 
because Mr H agreed to the terms when he signed up to PayPal. But for the reasons given 
Im satisfied it has acted in line with those terms. So it follows I wont be asking PayPal to do 
anything further. 
I know Mr M wont be happy with my decision but I hope the explanation I have provided 
makes clear why I have reached this outcome. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2022.
