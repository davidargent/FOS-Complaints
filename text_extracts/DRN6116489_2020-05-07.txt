Mr T complains Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr T took one running credit facility (RCF) and then 13 instalment loans. Ive included some  
of the information weve  received from Sunny about  these loans below;

The RCF (loan 1) is different to the instalment loans. The RCF allowed Mr T to either  request 
funds up to his agreed  credit limit in one go or take multiple drawdowns up to that limit. It 
appears Mr T had a credit limit of £300.  Each  drawdown could be repaid via five monthly 
instalments. 
Our adjudicator reviewed  the complaint and she thought Sunny  had made an error by 
allowing Mr T to drawdown under the RCF from 11 August 2014  as well as loans 2  5. And 
from loan 6 onwards,  the adjudicator thought  these  loans were unsustainable  for Mr T. 
Mr T appears to have accepted what our adjudicator said. However, Sunny didnt agree with 
the adjudicator.  But, it did say something may have gone wrong when it provided loans 8  
13 so it made an offer to settle  the complaint. 
Mr T didnt  accept this offer, and as no agreement could be reached, the case  has been 
passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN61164892Mr T has accepted the latest adjudicators findings. Sunny hasnt agreed with the 
adjudicators assessment  about the lending from 11 August 2014 until loan 7. It seems 
therefore that the other lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think  that I need to make a 
finding about it. 
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted the 
RCF drawdowns from 11 August 2014 and then the first seven instalment loans. But I have  
kept the other lending in mind when  thinking  about  the overall lending  relationship  between  
Sunny and Mr T. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute Sunny had to assess Mr Ts situation  to check  if he 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do 
this in a way which was proportionate  to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks  could have 
taken into account  a number of different things,  such as how much was being  lent, the size 
of the repayments  and Mr Ts income  and expenditure. With this in mind, I think  in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr T. These  factors include:
Mr T having  a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr T having  a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated  refinancing may signal that the borrowing  
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr T coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr T.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr T was able to repay  his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
There was also an expectation  in August 2014,  when the fifth drawdown  under the RCF was 
granted, that Sunny would review and monitor how Mr T was using the RCF facility. CONC 
Ref: DRN611648936.7.2 says; A firm must monitor a customers repayment record and take appropriate action 
where there  are signs of actual or possible repayment difficulties. 
So it wasnt  enough  for Sunny to just assess the further lending based  on what  it knew  when 
the RCF had initially been approved  in April 2014.  It also needed to monitor  how Mr T was 
using the facility - and then step in and provide help when or if it could see Mr T was, or was 
likely, having financial difficulties.
I can see that Mr T had a credit limit under the RCF of £300. In around a week  of having the 
facility Mr T had borrowed the maximum he could (£300). Mr T made some repayments at 
the end of May. But on the same day, the repayments were made, it seems Mr T borrowed 
back up to his credit limit with a drawdown of £46.71.It seems a similar  pattern happened  in 
June as well  this time,  after repayments were made Mr T borrowed another  £25. 
Following further repayments on 31 July 2014,  Mr T again took another drawdown  on 8 
August, and another on 11 August  which seems to have  taken  him back  up to his credit  
limit, although the running total of the account   provided by Sunny suggests that this point 
in time Mr T owed Sunny over £500.  But this wouldve included some interest.   
I think Sunny  should have  been aware  by 11 August (the fifth drawdown), that Mr T wasnt  
using his account as intended  or making  any headway  in repaying what he owed. The way in 
which Mr T was using  the facility I think was a sign that he was having actual or possible 
repayment difficulties.  Mr T had been  using his RCF for four months   and so, as per the 
credit agreement, he shouldve repaid most of what hed borrowed. Instead, by 11 August 
2014 Mr T was close to his credit  limit. In effect,  what Mr T had been  doing, given the small  
withdrawals, was borrowing to service the account, without actually making  any inroads into 
the capital sum hed borrowed. This isnt a sustainable form of borrowing and suggests to 
me that Mr T was having problems managing his money. 
In these circumstances, I dont think Sunny could have reasonably believed that Mr T would  
have been able to repay  drawdowns  on the RCF from 11 August 2014, or any further loans, 
without undue difficulty or without the need to borrow again. So I dont  think  Sunny shouldve 
allowed any further  drawdowns from this date. 
Before the RCF was fully repaid Sunny provided  Mr T with another  instalment loan of £250, 
and then, after the RCF was repaid,  Mr T took another two instalment loans of £350 and 
£150 within a matter of days of each  other  (so loans 2  5). And given the way these loans 
have been provided along with the amounts lent, I agree with our adjudicator that this had 
the same  effect  as unfairly allowing Mr T to continue to drawdown  on the RCF in a way that 
was unsustainable.  So, for this reason, Im upholding Mr Ts complaint about loans 2  5. 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, I agree with our 
adjudicator that Sunny  should  reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided  loan 6. 
Ref: DRN61164894I say this because:
By loan 6 it was 17 months into the lending  relationship and Mr T had been indebted 
to Sunny for the entire time. Mr T had taken 10 drawdowns under the RCF and 
following this, repayment towards  5 instalments loans. In my view, Mr Ts loan history 
up until this point  was a clear indication that his underlying financial situation didnt 
seem to be improving; 
Mr T took loan 2 while the RCF was still being repaid and then loans 3 and 4 a month 
after the RCF was repaid. Loan 5 was taken the same  day loan 2 was repaid.
So Sunny ought to have  realised that Mr T may have been borrowing  further  to cover 
a hole the repayment of previous loans had left in his finances and that this was 
indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
From  early  August  2014 Mr Ts borrowing under the RCF was broadly consistent. 
And the total amount  lent via the instalment loans led to Mr T getting further into debt. 
I think its most likely  this consistent  pattern of borrowing over the period showed that 
Mr T didnt just have a short-term cash-flow problem but was probably supporting 
regular living expenses or other financial  commitments; 
Mr Ts total lending history was prolonged with him being indebted to Sunny for 
around 42 months with no significant  decrease in his borrowing. The amount of time 
that Mr T spent indebted to Sunny  meant  that he was servicing  a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period of time.
I think that Mr T lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 and onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the number  of loans and the length of time in debt was likely to have had negative  
implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint about his borrowing from the fifth drawdown under the 
RCF (on 11 August 2014) to loan 7. And Sunny has already agreed to uphold  from loan 8 
onwards. And Ive set out what Sunny should do to put things right as detailed  below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on drawdowns on the RCF from
11 August 2014  as well as all interest,  fees and charges applied  to loans 2 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  on Mr Ts credit file about  the RCF from
11 August 2014  as well as loans 2 to 5;
Ref: DRN61164895remove loans 6 to 13 from Mr Ts credit file entirely,  this is because the period of time 
Mr T owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded  about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
