K821x#15complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 25 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr P between  February 2015 
and August 2016. Mr Ps borrowing history is listed at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Ps borrowing indicated he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  Sunny disagreed  and 
said it had done  robust  checks on Mr P  including reviewing reports  from credit  reference 
agencies  and these checks did not raise  any concerns. But it did offer to uphold  Mr Ps 
complaint from loan 23. Our adjudicator put this offer to Mr P but we havent  heard back  from 
him.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN09047832I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ps complaint about  loans 1 to 5. Mr P hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Sunny has offered to uphold Mr Ps complaint  about  loans 23 to 25 and whilst what it has 
offered to do is in line with our approach, I dont think  its gone far enough. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr P was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr P had taken out six loans within eight months and often  had more  
than one loan running with Sunny. So, Sunny should have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr P was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous 
loan was leaving in her finances  and that Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr P was provided  with a new loan within  days of taking out a 
previous one. 
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out 18 months after Mr Ps first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr P had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect;  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN09047833These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr P borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ps ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 6 to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 25 should be removed from   
Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr P a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020.
