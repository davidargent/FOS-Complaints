K821x#15complaint
Miss C says Casheuronet  UK LLC lent to her irresponsibly. She says she thinks  the loans 
were unaffordable and her debt problems  increased over the time she borrowed from 
QuickQuid. She says QuickQuid shouldve found  out about  this and not lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight payday  loans QuickQuid provided  to Miss C between 
October 2009 and March  2011. Loans  2 to 8 had two repayments. There  was one smaller 
one followed  by a larger one at the end. Miss C had some problems repaying some  of the 
loans, particularly loan 4.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. QuickQuid  disagreed  with the adjudicators 
opinion in part. It said that:
the repayments for loans 3 to 5 and loan 7 werent high enough to say that it was 
unlikely that Miss C wouldnt have been  able to sustainably repay them
but it also thought that, due to the short breaks in the lending, it shouldnt  have 
approved the second extension to loan 4, and loans 6 and 8. It made an offer of 
compensation in respect of these loans.  It later extended this offer to loans  3, 4, 6 
and 8 
Miss C didnt accept any of these offers and so the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Miss Cs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Miss Cs complaint in part and Ive explained  why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
Ref: DRN71572892These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Miss Cs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Miss C would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Miss C would have  been  able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Miss Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Miss Cs 
complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Miss C would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks  have shown  that Miss C would  have been able to do so?
Our adjudicator didnt  think that the QuickQuid was acting unfairly when  it approved loans 1 
and 2. Miss C didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 and 2. Because of 
this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement  about these loans so I wont  be making a 
decision about them.
Our adjudicator thought that if QuickQuid had made proportionate checks before loans 3 and 
4 then it wouldve  seen  that there was a significant  risk that Miss H wouldnt be able to make 
the loan repayments and not lent to her. 
QuickQuid agreed with our adjudicators opinion about loans 3 and 4. So I also dont think  
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And I agree  with what  the adjudicator 
said and the offer made by QuickQuid.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 8 because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Ref: DRN71572893taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided,  did the overall 
pattern of lending increase  Miss  Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think  that this 
point was reached by loan 5. I say this because:
the amounts  Miss C was borrowing increased  significantly  and they remained high. 
Miss C borrowed  at least £500 for loans 3, 4 and 5 and over £1,000 for loan 6. The 
highest repayment for loan 6 was just under  £250 less than Miss Cs declared 
income. QuickQuid ought to have realised it was likely  her indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably particularly given  her recorded income of £1,500
Miss C wasnt  really  reducing the amount she owed QuickQuid. She was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period
Miss C was demonstrating repayment difficulties from loan 4 onwards. Loan  4 had a 
term of 11 days but it took Miss C over six months  to repay it. I cant  see how 
QuickQuid couldve reasonably thought that Miss C would be in a position to repay  a 
loan of a similar amount straight after this 
I think that Miss C lost out because QuickQuid continued to approve loans from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and extensions) was likely to have had negative  
implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Miss Cs complaint about  loans 5 to 8 because  the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and shes lost out as a result.
I can see that QuickQuid  agreed with this in part and I note the offer of compensation it 
made in respect  of loans 6 and 8.
did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss C in some  
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
Whilst QuickQuid has already made offers in respect of some  of the lending, for 
completeness the compensation  it should  now pay is: 
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on loans 3 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
Ref: DRN71572894remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 from Miss Cs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 8 should be removed from 
Miss Cs credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss C a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Cs complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 May 2019.
