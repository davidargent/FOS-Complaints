DRN-3460221
The complaint
Mr E complains about the address format used by TransUnion International UK Limited on 
his credit file. 
What happened
In November 2021 Mr E complained to TransUnion as the address format for his residence 
wasnt displayed correctly. Mr E obtained a Certificate of Residency from his local authority 
which showed the correct address format and forwarded it to TransUnion. 
TransUnion said it had made the necessary changes but Mr E said the format was still 
wrong. Mr E referred his case to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
ultimately upheld Mr Es case and said TransUnion should update his address in line with 
the Certificate of Residency and pay Mr E £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
TransUnion didnt agree to settle in line with the investigators view, so Mr Es case has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E has provided a copy of the Certificate of Residency as provided by his local authority. 
Im satisfied that accurately confirms Mr Es address format. I can see from TransUnions 
final response that it received evidence from Mr Es council confirming the correct address 
format. TransUnions final response goes on to say it had made the necessary changes. 
The issue here is that the address TransUnion updated to doesnt match the address in the 
Certificate of Residency. And Mr E is upset the address on his credit file remains inaccurate. 
I can see how important this issue is for Mr E and that ensuring his address is correct is a 
priority. I think TransUnion shouldve done more to ensure Mr Es address was amended so 
it was in line with the Certificate of Residency. 
Im satisfied the situation has been ongoing for too long and caused Mr E a reasonable level 
of distress and inconvenience. As a result, Im also awarding £150 to reflect the impact of 
the issues raised on Mr E and the level of distress and inconvenience caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Es complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited 
to settle as follows: 
- Update Mr Es address so it matches the Certificate of Residency as provided by 
Mr Es local authority
- Pay Mr E £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2022.
