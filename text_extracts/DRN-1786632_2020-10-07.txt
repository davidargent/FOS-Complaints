The complaint
Miss C complains that BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited, trading as Mini Financial 
Services, has terminated her hire purchase agreement. Shes being helped with her 
complaint by a representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Miss H under a hire purchase agreement with Mini 
Financial Services that she electronically signed in April 2018; 
she contacted the dealer, and then Mini Financial Services, in June 2019 about 
returning the car because she was moving overseas;
the car had been supplied to her by Mini Financial Services and her agreement was 
with it so any discussions that she had with the dealer werent binding on Mini 
Financial Services;
Mini Financial Services explained to Miss C in August 2019 that she would be in 
breach of the agreement if she went overseas as she would no longer be in 
possession of the car and it provided her with quotes for voluntarily terminating and 
surrendering the agreement;
the quotes werent acceptable to Miss C and she went overseas;
the agreement required Miss C to: 
keep the vehicle in your possession and under your control and not sell, rent 
or dispose of it or attempt to do so or allow someone other than you to 
become  the Vehicles registered keeper; 
and it said: 
We will have the right to end this agreement, after sending you any notices 
required by law if [you do not keep possession of the vehicle, or the vehicle is 
seized, arrested, sold or abandoned] and you do not remedy them within the 
required period;
I consider that by moving overseas the car was no longer in Miss Cs possession and 
under her control;
Mini Financial Services sent Miss C a default notice in September 2019 but she didnt 
remedy the default so it terminated the agreement;
I sympathise with Miss C for the unexpected difficulties that shes experienced as a 
result of her move overseas  and it seems clear that the dealers involvement has 
confused matters  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mini Financial Services has acted incorrectly in these circumstances;
it properly explained the potential default to Miss C and the options that were 
available to her and I consider that it was reasonable for it to conclude that Miss C 
had breached the agreement when she moved overseas  it then sent her a notice of 
default, as if was required to do, before it terminated the agreement; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mini Financial Services to 
reinstate Miss Cs agreement, to remove the default from her credit file, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
I understand that the car hasnt yet been repossessed but I suggest that Miss C now 
contacts Mini Financial Services to try to agree an affordable arrangement for her to pay to it 
the outstanding balance of her account. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
