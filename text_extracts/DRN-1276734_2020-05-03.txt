The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc isnt supporting him to reduce his 
overdraft with it.
What happened
Mr P complains about how much its costing him to have an overdraft with NatWest. Hes 
paying between £40 and £100 per month just for that borrowing. He said hes been telling 
NatWest about his debt problems for some time. And if NatWest had given him the loan hed 
asked for, then the money hes paid so far wouldve just about paid off his debt by now. 
Mr P wanted NatWest to offer him a consolidation loan. Because it had repeatedly failed to 
do that, he said it should to write off all or part of his overdraft, and pay him compensation. 
NatWest said the charges on Mr Ps account had been applied in line with the terms of the 
account. And it hadnt been able to offer Mr P a consolidation loan. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said NatWest appeared to 
be debiting charges to Mr Ps account in line with the terms and conditions that Mr P had 
agreed to. She couldnt challenge those fees as being too high or excessive, because of a 
Supreme Court case. But she could check they were in line with NatWests terms and 
conditions, and they appeared to be. 
Our investigator said Mr P had told NatWest that he was in a debt management plan, but he 
hadnt included the overdraft in this plan. And he didnt seem to have spoken to NatWests 
financial hardship team. She suggested he might like to do this now. 
Our investigator said NatWest had offered Mr P financial advice. It had refunded charges 
and offered breathing space to allow him to bring his overdraft back within the agreed limit. 
And she didnt think NatWest had made a mistake in applying the charges to Mr Ps account. 
So she didnt ask it to do any more. 
Mr P replied to say that banks are supposed to be positive and sympathetic when 
someones in financial difficulties. He said if NatWest had done that, then he wouldnt be in 
this situation now. He disputed that anyone at NatWest had ever offered him advice, and 
said if it had done, he wouldve shared his income and expenditure with it. But he thought 
NatWest wasnt interested in helping him. 
Mr P wanted his case to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Our investigator explained the role of our service in looking at charges for overdrafts is 
limited by a previous court case. We can check if charges have been applied in line with the 
terms of the account. I havent seen anything here to suggest NatWest has got this wrong. 
Our service does expect banks to act positively and sympathetically when someones having 
financial difficulties. In this case, Mr P said hes repeatedly asked NatWest to change his 
overdraft for a loan, which would allow him to repay the money with lower charges. But 
NatWest has said no. 
NatWest doesnt have to allow Mr P to take out a loan with it. And its not necessarily failing 
to act positively and sympathetically if it refuses to set up a consolidation loan. 
I can see that NatWest has mentioned its financial difficulties team to Mr P a number of 
times. And our investigator said that it didnt seem like Mr P had ever contacted this team. 
NatWest has also mentioned other sources of support to Mr P, such as external debt 
management charities that could support him if hes having difficulties. I understand Mr P 
has entered into a debt management plan, so hes aware of this support. And NatWest has, 
as our investigator mentioned, refunded fees on Mr Ps account from time to time. 
I know that Mr P would like NatWest to do more than this. But Im sorry to have to tell Mr P 
that I dont think it has to. Ive considered this case carefully, and I dont think that NatWest 
has failed to offer Mr P the sorts of help and support that I would expect. And in particular, 
our service wont usually make a bank lend someone money, if the bank doesnt think that 
person can afford it. So I wont make NatWest do that here, or ask it to write off part of Mr 
Ps debt because its refused to do so.  
I know Mr P will be disappointed, but I dont think his complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2020.
