The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) have provided his contact 
details to a third party putting his security at risk.
What happened
Mr H said after making a purchase with PayPal his address and telephone details were sent 
to the seller. And theyd passed his details to other parties. Mr H said that the information 
PayPal had passed on put his security at risk as it provided several verification details about 
him. Mr H complained to PayPal and asked that his address and phone number are kept 
separate, and that both arent provided to the sellers.
PayPal said that the correct procedures were followed and were in accordance with their 
User Agreement and Policies. But offered Mr H £500 for the inconvenience this had caused. 
Mr H wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said that PayPal had followed their procedures which Mr H had agreed to 
when he opened the account. He didnt ask PayPal to do anything further.
Mr H didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
It may help to explain that this service was set up to consider individual complaints, so its 
not the role of the Financial Ombudsman Service to make findings about a businesss wider 
practices or processes  that is something for the regulator, the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA) to do. 
Mr H said PayPal shouldnt have sent his address and telephone details to the seller. I can 
understand Mr H is concerned about how his data is being used. While I empathise with        
Mr Hs position, for me to say PayPal must do something different I must first be satisfied 
that theyve done something wrong. I cant see that they have here which is why I wont be 
asking them to do anything else.
On opening a PayPal account, the user  Mr H, is required to agree to PayPals Privacy 
Statement and User Agreement. Ive considered these when reaching my decision. 
PayPals Privacy Statement says its aim is to provide sufficient information about how they 
use the personal data thats given to them. The Privacy Statement details amongst other 
information, what personal data is collected, how its stored and used. For contact 
information it says:
Registration and Contact Information. Depending on the Services you choose, we will 
collect your name, mailing address, income, telephone number, tax ID, Payment Information, 
profession, employment or business information, and other information necessary to 
establish an account.
Id consider this is clear that Mr Hs address and telephone number is amongst the data 
collected by PayPal. 
The Privacy Statement goes on to say how this data can be used. The Privacy Statement is 
clear that it isnt shared with other parties for marketing purposes. But:
With merchants and others involved in a transaction, for example when you use the 
Services to initiate online purchases, pay other Users, or return goods we may share 
information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your 
transactions. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of our contractual 
obligations to you. Please note that Personal Data shared with merchants involved in a 
transaction is subject to the merchants own privacy policy and procedures.
Im satisfied that PayPal have made clear that Mr Hs data could be shared with the seller he 
made his purchase with. So, I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong as they have 
adhered to their Privacy Statement which Mr H agreed to as a PayPal user.
Mr H said after making his purchase he was contacted by other third parties. PayPal have 
offered Mr H £500 to compensate him for his poor experience. As I dont think PayPal has 
done anything wrong its for Mr H to decide whether to accept PayPals offer.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
