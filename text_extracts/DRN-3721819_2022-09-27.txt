The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was unable to recover funds
that were transferred to the wrong person.
What happened
The background to Mr Ps complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my 
provisional decision. I said: 
On 30 April 2021 Mr P made two transfers for the purchase of a vehicle. But due to an 
oversight, Mr P used the wrong payment recipient when making the transfer. As a result, 
Mr Ps money was transferred to a third party hed made a payment to previously.
Mr P contacted NatWest on the same day and has told us he was advised to wait 24 hours 
before submitting a claim to get his money back. Mr P spoke with NatWest again several 
times in the weeks that followed and raised a claim to get the transfer back.
NatWest contacted the receiving bank (B) to try and reclaim Mr Ps funds. The two banks 
looked into Mr Ps claim but the funds werent returned to Mr P who went on to raise a 
complaint. NatWest issued several responses, awarding Mr P £150 on 16 June 2021, £25 
on 15 July 2021, £50 on 5 August 2021. Whilst NatWest accepted there had been delays 
with its investigation it didnt offer to refund Mr Ps transfers.
Mr P referred his complaint to us and NatWest advised it wanted to increase the 
compensation offered by a further £100, taking the total award to £325. An investigator at 
this service looked at Mr Ps complaint but thought NatWest had dealt with it fairly and 
offered a reasonable level of compensation. Mr P asked to appeal, so his complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision.
On receipt of the case, I reviewed the file and arranged for our investigator to contact B 
(the receiving bank). B has since provided evidence that the full funds Mr P transferred to 
the wrong account were withdrawn on the same day.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P has made a number of points and set out a very details timeline when bringing their 
complaint. Ive considered and read everything that all parties have said and sent to us. If I 
havent directly mentioned something thats happened or responded to each point raised it 
isnt because I havent considered it. I have. In line with this services role as a quick and 
informal body, Ill be focusing on the key issues of this complaint in deciding whats fair 
and reasonable. An approach our rules allow me to take. Id like to assure all parties that 
no discourtesy is intended by this approach.
Ive taken the step of issuing a provisional decision here as new information has come to 
light since Mr Ps case was referred to me. I felt there may have been gaps in the timeline 
provided by NatWest that indicated it couldve conducted its investigations more efficiently. 
I wanted to get a better understanding of whether delays by NatWest had led to a loss for
Mr P. So I asked the investigator to obtain information from B about the account Mr P sent 
the transfers to on 30 April 2021.
B responded and provided evidence that shows the funds Mr P transferred were 
withdrawn from the receiving account on 30 April 2021, the date received. I think this is 
important information. Ive been brief in setting out the timeline above, but Im conscious 
there are, what I feel to be, unexplained delays by NatWest. In addition, it appears B had 
to query some of the information included in the initial claim because of the format 
NatWest used. But, whilst I agree there were some delays and the service provided 
couldve been better, that doesnt appear to have impacted the overall situation.
Once the recipient of the funds withdrew the them there was little NatWest could do to 
retrieve them. And, as I said, the transfer funds were withdrawn on the same day they were 
received. So even if NatWests investigation had been conducted more efficiently, the 
position would remain broadly the same. As a result, I cant fairly say that delays by 
NatWest impacted whether it was able to recall Mr Ps funds.
I have looked at the full timeline of Mr Ps case and we have obtained lots of calls he had 
with NatWest. Its clear Mr P took an active role in trying to recover his money and, as Ive 
said, I found the process couldve been handled more efficiently by NatWest. There were 
gaps in the timeline that appear unexplained and miscommunications with B. Im satisfied 
that caused Mr P a reasonable level of distress and inconvenience. So I agree NatWest 
should compensate Mr P for that.
NatWest paid Mr P a total of £225 when responding to his complaint and has gone on to 
offer a further £100 taking the total award to £325. Whilst I agree the service provided was 
poor at times, Im satisfied the existing settlement fairly reflects the impact to Mr P. In my 
view, £325 is a fair way to resolve Mr Ps case and very much in line with what I wouldve 
awarded had no offer been made. As Im satisfied NatWest has made an offer that is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances I dont intend to tell it to increase the award or do 
anything else.
I invited both parties to respond with any comments or additional information they wanted 
me to consider. 
Mr P responded and confirmed he didnt accept. Mr P wanted to know when NatWest found 
out the recipient had withdrawn the funds. Mr P also said it was clear from the evidence that 
NatWest didnt know what was going on and asked for a detailed timeline setting out what 
happened. Mr P also asked why NatWest had failed to provide the recipients details. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am very sorry as I understand my provisional decision was unwelcome and that Mr P feels 
NatWest failed to act with due skill when trying to recover his money. If I had found that 
delays or service issues from NatWest meant Mr Ps chances of retrieving his funds, I 
wouldve taken a different approach in this case. But we contacted the recipients bank and it 
confirmed the funds deposited were withdrawn the same day. So whilst I accept NatWest 
couldve provided better service to Mr P, I havent found evidence that shows delays led to 
the withdrawal being completed before additional steps could be taken by the receiving 
bank. I agree the service provided by NatWest was poor at times. NatWest upheld various 
elements of Mr Ps complaint. And in my provisional decision I explained I felt it was fair to 
increase the compensation to £325 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience caused. 
I still think thats a fair way to resolve Mr Ps complaint, for broadly the same reasons. 
Mr Ps response also says NatWest failed to provide the details of the recipient. But the 
recipient was a payee Mr P had paid before. Mr Ps complaint submissions confirm hes 
aware of the individuals identity. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr P as I understand the sums involved are substantial. But I 
havent been persuaded to change the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I 
still think NatWests offer to pay Mr P a total of £325 is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. 
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr P a total of £325 for the 
distress and inconvenience caused (less any compensation already paid). 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2022.
