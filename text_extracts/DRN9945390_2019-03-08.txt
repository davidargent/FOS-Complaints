K821x#15complaint
Mr D says that Financial Insurance Company Limited mis-sold him a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy.
background
Its been agreed in this case  that Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL),  as the 
insurer, should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple, Ill refer to 
FICL as the seller  in my decision.
I issued my provisional decision in January 2019,  a copy of which  is attached and forms
part of this final decision. In my provisional  decision I explained  why I was intending to 
uphold Mr Ds complaint.  
I asked everyone to send  me any further comments and information before  I reached a final 
decision. Neither Mr D or FICL sent me anything further to consider.        
my findings
Ive re-considered all the evidence  and arguments  already sent to us to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable.  As Ive not received any new evidence, Ive reached the same conclusions             
I reached in my provisional  decision, for the same  reasons.
what the business needs  to do
FICL should put Mr D in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt taken out PPI. The 
policy should be cancelled if it hasnt been cancelled already and:
A.FICL  should find out how much Mr D would owe on his card if the policy  hadnt been  
added to it.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on 
those premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-
sale of the PPI  as well as any interest  added to those charges.
FICL should then refund  the difference between what  Mr D owes  and what  he would  
have owed.
If Mr D made a successful claim under the PPI policy, FICL can take off what  he got 
for the claim from the amount it owes him.
B.If  when FICL works  out what Mr D would have owed each month without PPI     
Mr D paid more than enough to clear his balance, FICL should also pay simple 
interest on the extra Mr D paid. And it should carry on paying  interest  until the point 
when Mr D wouldve owed FICL something on his card.  The interest rate should be 
8% a year.
C.FICL  should tell Mr D what its done to work  out A and B.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires FICL to take off tax from this interest. FICL must give    
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.

For the reasons  Ive explained in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ds complaint. FICL should 
do what Ive outlined above to put things right. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or reject 
my decision  before 8 April  2019.

complaint
Mr D says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
Ref: DRN99453903background
This complaint is about a store card PPI policy Mr D took out in 2001. It was added to his 
account when  he applied for a store card.
Its been agreed in this case  that Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL),  as the
insurer, should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple, Ill refer to
FICL as the seller  in my decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint. FICL disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so the 
complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ds case.  
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ds complaint  because:
I dont think FICL gave Mr D clear enough information about  the policy. I say this based on 
the information that FICL have said Mr D would have been given at the time of sale.  
In this case, I think this would have mattered to Mr D because of his employment 
circumstances at the time meant it was harder for him to make an unemployment claim on 
this policy  than he reasonably would have  expected.
I dont think Mr D wouldve bought the policy if FICL had given him enough  information about 
it. So, I think Mr D has lost out because  of what FICL did wrong. 
Ive taken into account FICLs comments, including what it said about  ...Customer Credit 
Agreement shows that the customer has signed  to accept the account cover and this states  
"only sign this box if you require Account Cover .
Its not in dispute  that Mr D has signed  separately  to add PPI to his account. But in my 
opinion, he wouldnt have  done so if hed been  fully aware of the terms relating to making a 
claim for unemployment on this policy.
So I still currently intend to uphold the complaint based on what Ive seen  so far.
putting things right
FICL should put Mr D in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt taken out PPI. The 
policy should be cancelled if it hasnt been cancelled already and:
A.FICL  should find out how much Mr D would owe on his card if the policy  hadnt been  
added to it.

mis-sale of the PPI  as well as any interest added to those charges.
FICL should then refund  the difference between what  Mr D owes  and what  he would  
have owed.
If Mr D made a successful claim under the PPI policy, FICL can take off what  he got

my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I currently intend  to uphold  Mr Ds complaint.
If Mr D or Financial  Insurance Company Limited have anything further to add, they should do 
so by 1 March 2019 and I will then reconsider the complaint.
