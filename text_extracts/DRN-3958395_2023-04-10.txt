The complaint
The Estate of Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) allowed two 
payments to be made from Mr Gs account. The estate is represented by Mrs M.
What happened
Mrs M says she was Mr Gs carer and partner. She says she discovered he made two large 
payments of Â£10,000 in 2020 and 2021 to a charity I will call S before he passed away in 
2022. Mrs M says NatWest didnt make any checks on the payments and that Mr G hadnt 
made similar payments before. She would like NatWest to reimburse the money.
NatWest says its security systems didnt raise any issues with the payments and that they 
were made to a legitimate charity. It says even if it had asked Mr G about the payments then 
it likely he would have confirmed they were authorised. NatWest says it didnt have a record 
of any vulnerability concerns about Mr G.
Mrs M brought the complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought it likely that even if NatWest asked Mr G about the payments, then he 
would have confirmed they were genuine.
Mrs M doesnt accept that view and says no checks were actually made and that Mr G 
wasnt protected by his bank.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mrs M will be disappointed by my decision.
Im satisfied this was Mr Gs account and it was up to him to decide how he spent his money. 
There is no reason to suspect it was anyone other than Mr G that made the payments as 
they were to a recognised charity using his account details. 
Banks must have fraud and security measures in place to protect its and its customers 
money but its up to a business to decide how it operates such systems. I think it unlikely that 
a recognised charity would have triggered fraud concerns. I appreciate Mrs M says she was 
Mr Gs carer, but I wouldnt have expected NatWest to have known about any vulnerability 
issues about money unless either Mr G or Mrs M told it about such concerns. I cant see any 
evidence on NatWests records that it was told about any concerns and dont think Mrs M 
has told us that she told NatWest about any concerns she may have had about Mr Gs 
position. If that were the case, then I would have expected NatWest to have monitored Mr 
Gs account and put measures in place to protect his money. But as I have made clear Im 
satisfied NatWest wasnt aware of any such concerns and I have not been told for example if 
Mr G was unable to manage his finances. 
I appreciate Mrs M says NatWest ought to have checked the payments. But Im satisfied that 
Mr G made the payments and even if asked about them would have confirmed they were 
genuine. I make clear that Im satisfied that Mr G was not the victim of fraud and it is difficult 
to see what further checks NatWest could carry out in these circumstances or what else it 
could do.
Overall, Im satisfied Mr G made these payments and that its not NatWest role to decide 
what he should be spending his money on in the absence of any fraud concerns or 
vulnerability issues. I also think it likely that Mr G was able to manage his financial affairs 
until he passed away as there is no record of NatWest being told about any concerns and 
that these payments didnt come to light until after he passed away. It follows that I cant 
fairly order NatWest reimburse these payments as Mrs M would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr G 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 May 2023.
