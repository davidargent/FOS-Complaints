The complaint
Mr Gs complaint is about the administration of a buy-to-let mortgage application he made to 
HSBC UK Bank Plc in DATE. He is unhappy that the mortgage didnt complete when he 
wanted it to and believes this was due to errors on the part of the solicitors appointed by 
HSBC. As such, Mr G thinks HSBC should pay the additional interest he incurred when his 
old mortgage reverted to a higher interest rate, and an additional sum for his time and 
inconvenience.
What happened
Mr G applied to HSBC to re-mortgage his rental property. The interest rate product on his 
existing mortgage would end on 31 January 2022 and so he wanted the re-mortgage to 
complete on 1 February 2022 so that the existing mortgage didnt revert to a higher interest 
rate. 
The mortgage offer was issued to Mr G on 8 November 2021 and it was accepted later that 
month. 
HSBCs solicitors records show that it requested a redemption statement from Mr Gs 
existing lender on 17 January 2022 by automated fax. This request was then chased via the 
lenders portal on 26 January 2022, by email on 2 February 2022 and by telephone on 
8 February 2022. In that conversation it was confirmed that the statement had been 
produced and would be faxed as soon as possible. It was received by HSBCs solicitors at 
4.33pm on 8 February 2022. The documentation requesting the release of funds was 
submitted to HSBC on 10 February 2022 and the mortgage completed the following day.
On 3 February 2022 Mr G complained to HSBC that the mortgage hadnt completed on time. 
He said he thought that HSBC should sack the solicitors it had appointed because of this 
and due to the fact that it was impossible to contact the solicitors by telephone and it didnt 
respond to emails. 
HSBC responded to the complaint on 2 March 2022. It said that the solicitors had been 
aware that Mr G wanted to complete on 1 February 2022 and requested the redemption 
statement on 17 January 2022, and as no response was received made two further requests 
in January and February 2022. As the redemption statement wasnt received until 
8 February 2022, it hadnt been possible to complete on the date Mr G had wanted. HSBC 
suggested that Mr G speak to his previous lender regarding the additional interest. 
Mr G was not satisfied with HSBCs response and asked us to consider the complaint. When 
doing so, Mr G told us that his previous lender confirmed to him orally that it didnt receive a 
request for a redemption statement until 2 February 2022. 
One of our investigators considered the complaint, but didnt recommend that it be upheld. 
Mr G didnt accept the investigators opinion. He didnt consider that the evidence from 
HSBC the investigator had relied on was sufficient as it was a timeline document produced 
by HSBC itself. He considered that evidence should have been requested from his previous 
lender, which would have shown HSBC was not telling the truth. Mr G asked that the 
complaint be referred to an ombudsman.
The investigator considered Mr Gs comments, but they didnt change his opinion. As such, 
the complaint was referred for consideration by an ombudsman.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I will explain first that the Financial Ombudsman Service is independent of both consumers 
and the businesses they are complaining about. This means that we dont act for consumers, nor do we take instructions either from consumers or businesses, or allow either 
party to direct the course of our investigations. Were we to do so, it would compromise our 
independence and impartiality. Its up to us to identify what the issues are in a complaint, 
and to decide what evidence we need in order to investigate that complaint. So although I 
have noted Mr Gs comments on how he thinks the complaint should be investigated, I am 
satisfied that I can reach the right decision based on the information I currently have.
While Mr G doesnt believe that HSBCs solicitors requested the redemption statement until 
after the date he wanted to complete, I have seen the evidence that it was requested on 
17 January 2022, in plenty of time for 1 February 2022 completion date he had requested. 
This request detailed the correct account number and address for the mortgaged property. I 
have also seen the evidence that the request was chased both before and after Mr Gs 
requested completion date. As such, I cant find that HSBC caused delays in the mortgage 
completion or is liable for any additional interest Mr G incurred after 1 February 2022.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr G to accept or reject my decision before 
23 November 2022.
