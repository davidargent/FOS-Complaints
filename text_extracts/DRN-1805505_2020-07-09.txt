The complaint
Mrs M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc(NatWest) has been unable to retrieve 
a payment of £500 that was made to the wrong account.
What happened
Mrs M made a payment of £500 from her account to her family member's account that was 
held with a bank I will call "B". She says she noticed some months later that it had been 
made to an account that had been closed and checked her account and saw two payments 
returned by B that she had made to the same account. Mrs M would like her money back.
NatWest says Mrs M authorised the payment herself and it asked B to return the money. It 
says B hasn't responded to the request but says it was made some months after Mrs M 
made the transaction. NatWest says it hasn't made a mistake.
Mrs M brought her complaint to us and our investigator didn't uphold it. The investigator 
thought Mrs M made and authorised the payment and NatWest had tried to retrieve the 
money. The investigator didn't think NatWest was at fault or responsible for B's actions.
Mrs M doesn't accept that view and questions why some payments were returned by B. 
What Ive decided  and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for similar reasons. I realise Mrs M will be disappointed 
by my decision and I appreciate how strongly she feels about what's taken place.
There is no dispute here that Mrs M made and authorised the payment of £500. I'm satisfied 
that Mrs M used her family members account details and that NatWest simply followed those 
instructions. In those circumstances I can't fairly hold NatWest responsible for the payment 
mistake.
We would expect NatWest in cases of a mistaken payment to request that it be returned. 
The problem here is that Mrs M didn't notice the mistake for some months and it seems B 
didn't respond to NatWest's request. I appreciate Mrs M's frustration in those circumstances 
but I'm satisfied that NatWest tried to help Mrs M and it's not got Mrs M's money or is in a 
position to insist on its return.
I hope Mrs M or her family member will ask B where the money is and I hope NatWest will 
continue to try and liaise with B about trying to resolve the problem. I appreciate 
DRN-1805505NatWest has asked B to return the money but I would expect it to continue to seek a 
response from B.
Overall I sympathise with Mrs M but I don't think what has taken place is NatWest's fault or 
that it could do any more to obtain the return of the money. I also think that NatWest can't 
explain why B returned some of the payments, but not others. Those are matters Mrs M's 
family member will need to raise with B.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2020.
