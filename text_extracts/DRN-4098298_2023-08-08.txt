The complaint
Mr F complains PrePay Technologies Limited has refused to refund transactions he says he 
didnt carry out or authorise.
What happened
Mr F has a prepaid travel money card issued by PrePay Technologies Limited. He also has 
a debit card and a credit card issued by a bank.
Mr F says he lost his wallet and that it contained his cards, cash and driving licence amongst 
other things. He says he spoke to the bank that had issued his debit and credit card to report 
those cards lost / stolen and that his son contacted PrePay Technologies. He says his debit 
and credit card were used fraudulently but that his bank agreed to refund him.
Mr F says he had to chase PrePay Technologies as he didnt hear back from it. He says 
PrePay Technologies said it wouldnt refund transactions that had occurred after he did so 
saying that he hadnt reported his card as lost / stolen as soon as he should have done.
Mr F was unhappy with PrePay Technologies response and complained to us.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Fs complaint and said that they didnt think PrePay 
Technologies had acted fairly as Mr F had asked his son to report the card as lost / stolen. In 
the circumstances, our investigator didnt think it was fair of PrePay Technologies to say that 
it was holding Mr F liable for transactions hed not carried out or authorised. So, they 
recommended that PrePay Technologies refund the transactions Mr F had disputed, totalling 
£746.96.
PrePay Technologies disagreed with our investigators recommendations saying that it was 
the cardholders responsibility to report their card as lost / stolen and that Mr F hadnt done 
so until more than a week after the event. PrePay Technologies also said that Mr F had not 
kept his security details secure either as the transactions he was disputing had been 
authenticated using his PIN. In the circumstances, PrePay Technologies said it hadnt acted 
unfairly holding Mr F liable for the transactions he was disputing. As PrePay Technologies 
didnt agree, Mr Fs complaint was passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that Mr Fs wallet  containing his bank cards and travel pre-pay card, amongst 
other things  was lost or stolen. Im also satisfied that the PIN for all three of those cards 
was the same. That means Mr Fs PIN could have been despite the fact that hed not used 
his pre-pay card for several months when he used his debit and / or credit card. More 
importantly, Im satisfied that the transactions Mr F is complaining about  and the 
transactions his bank refunded  werent transactions he carried out or consented to. In the 
circumstances, I agree with our investigator that PrePay Technologies didnt do enough to 
show that it was fair to hold Mr F liable for the transactions hes disputing.
I agree with PrePay Technologies that, under the terms and conditions of the card in 
question, cardholders must report any card as lost / stolen as soon as possible. Mr F didnt 
speak to PrePay Technologies until a week after hed originally lost his wallet / had it stolen. 
In other words, I agree that Mr F didnt personally report his card as lost / stolen as soon as 
possible. In this case, however, Im satisfied that this is because Mr F had asked a member 
of his family to do so as he was concentrating on reporting his debit and credit card as lost / 
stolen and following up other items that had been in his wallet. I dont think, in this particular 
case, that Mr F not reporting the loss himself is enough in itself to say that PrePay 
Technologies can fairly hold him liable for transactions he didnt carry out or authorise.
Putting things right
I agree with our investigator, given what Ive just said, that PrePay Technologies should 
refund the transactions Mr F is disputing. In other words, that PrePay Technologies should 
refund transactions totalling £746.96.
My final decision
My final decision is that I require PrePay Technologies Limited to refund transactions 
totalling £746.96 in full and final settlement of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2023.
