investment scam.

Mr G got in touch with HSBC on 25 January 2022 to report hed been scammed. HSBC 
reviewed Mr Gs report and concluded it was out of time to raise chargeback claims. It also 
considered Mr Gs claim under section 75 and after some delay, also concluded section 75 
wasnt an option for him. 
Remaining unhappy, Mr G referred his complaint about HSBC to this service. After further 
review, HSBC acknowledged it provided poor customer service when it handled Mr Gs 
section 75 claim as three separate Complaint Specialists reviewed his claim and made no 
attempts to contact him, which caused delay. It offered £200 for the trouble and upset 
caused to Mr G.
As our Investigator was unable to resolve the matter informally, the case has been passed to 
me for a decision. 
I wrote to Mr G to put HSBCs offer of compensation to him and to explain why I wasnt 
minded to uphold the complaint. Mr G replied and accepted the offer of compensation but 
reiterated that HSBC didnt do enough to prevent the scam he fell victim to and asked that I 
review his case again. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont uphold this complaint and Ill explain why. 
Prevention
Its common ground that Mr G authorised the payments in question here, under the Payment 
Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of his account, Mr G is presumed liable 
for his loss in the first instance. 
That said, taking into account the law, regulatory rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and good industry practice, there are circumstances where it might be appropriate 
for a bank to take additional steps or make additional checks before processing a payment 
to help protect its customers from the possibility of financial harm from fraud and scams. But 
there is a balance to be struck between identifying payments that could potentially be 
fraudulent and minimising disruption to legitimate payments.
Ive noted at the time of Mr Gs payments, F was regulated in Cyprus and had passporting 
rights through the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). What this meant was that F had 
permission to offer investment products and services to UK customers. This is an important 
factor because HSBC has an obligation to help protect customers from the possibility of 
financial harm from fraud and scams but it is under no obligation to prevent bad or risky 
investments. 
Ive noted the FCA removed Fs passporting rights on 1 June 2020 citing concerns about 
their sales and marketing practices. However, I dont think HSBC could have reasonably 
been aware of a decision the FCA was to make almost six months after Mr Gs final payment 
to F. 
I dont think the payments in dispute ought to have caused HSBC enough concern for it to 
have blocked them pending further discussions with Mr G. The payments to F started off 
relatively small and were spaced out by a few days and weeks which doesnt appear out of 
character for an investment. 
Ive noted Mr G paid F two payments totalling £5,000 on 6 January 2020, which is a large 
sum of money. But Ive also noted that Mr G used his credit card account to make the 
payments and the payments were well within his credit limit. Credit cards tend to be used for 
larger one-off transactions, so I dont think these amounts  albeit larger than the others  
would have appeared particularly concerning to HSBC. And in light of the fact that there was 
no prior adverse information about F and they were on the face of it a legitimate company, I 
dont find that HSBC had reasonable grounds to have intervened.  
Recovery
Having decided the above, I could only uphold this complaint if I thought HSBC 
unreasonably hindered recovery of the funds (or some of them) and that this caused Mr G 
loss.
As these were credit card payments, the only potential avenue for recovery of the funds was 
through the chargeback scheme or section 75. The chargeback process is voluntary and run by the card scheme  in this case Visa -
whereby it will ultimately arbitrate on a dispute between the merchant and customer if it 
cannot be resolved between them after two presentments. Such arbitration is subject to the 
rules of the scheme  so there are limited grounds on which a chargeback can succeed or 
be deemed a valid claim. 
Our role in such cases is not to second-guess the card scheme rules, but to determine 
whether the regulated card issuer (i.e. HSBC) acted fairly and reasonably when presenting 
(or choosing not to present) a chargeback on behalf of Mr G.
The scheme includes time limits for claims to be raised. Visas time limits are commonly 120 
days and in some cases, a maximum time limit of 540 days from the date of the transaction 
is allowed. Mr G didnt notify HSBC of his claim until more than two years after the date of 
his final payment to F. So I dont think HSBC acted unfairly by choosing not to raise 
chargeback claims for Mr G as he didnt report the matter within the permitted timescales 
allowed by Visa. 
Ive also noted that HSBC considered Mr Gs claim under section 75 and concluded it could 
not provide a refund in accordance with the Act. Im minded to agree that this is correct. Our 
investigator requested additional information from Mr G to substantiate his claims that hed 
been scammed. Having looked over Mr Gs comments, Ive noted that he didnt have any 
evidence to demonstrate F misrepresented themselves to him or breached the agreement 
he had. Mr G alleged that the trading platform he was provided with by F was fake and Ive 
not seen any evidence  either from him or in the public domain  to show this was indeed a 
fake trading platform. And so, I dont think Mr G has established a valid claim under 
misrepresentation and/or breach of contract in accordance with section 75.
As Mr G has accepted HSBCs offer of £200 compensation in relation to the poor customer 
service he received, Ive not made any additional finding on this point. HSBC should make 
arrangements to pay Mr G within 28 days of the date of this final decision. 
My final decision
My final decision is, I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2023.
