The complaint
Mr L as the Executor of the estate of the late Ms T complains that National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to close Ms Ts account before she died despite him being given 
the authority to close the account by Ms T and him complying with all NatWests stated 
requirements for closing an account from abroad. Mr L says this has resulted in Ms Ts 
estate incurring unnecessary costs - in particular having to get a grant of probate resealed.
What happened
The late Ms T held an account with NatWest opened around 1994 which held a significant 
amount of money in it. Ms T was in her 90s and lived abroad. She wished to close her 
account with NatWest and asked her son, Mr L to do so on her behalf.
NatWests website says that to close an account if you live abroad and are unable to attend 
a branch, that a customer can request closure in writing signed by the account holder. 
On 18 April 2022 Mr L sent NatWest a letter instructing it to close Ms Ts account. Within the 
letter he enclosed Ms Ts last bank summary, an extract from NatWests website regarding 
its procedure followed for account closure and a letter authorising Mr L to act on Ms Ts 
behalf with instructions to close the account and where to transfer the funds signed by Mr L 
and Ms T witnessed by a solicitor. Mr L asked that NatWest contact him by email and to 
acknowledge receipt and advise of the approximate time to process the closure.
NatWest responded to this by letter to Ms T dated 5 May explaining that it was unable to 
close the account as her signature couldnt be validated and asked that she provide a new 
closure authority signed in accordance with your current mandate. NatWest sent a chaser 
letter for this on 13 May. 
Mr L telephoned NatWest on 24 May where he says he explained the situation with his 
mother and was told his mothers signatures dont match. When Mr L asked what evidence 
was required to validate her signature he was told he would be sent an email explaining 
what was required. Mr L called again on 26 May. He says he spent around 45 minutes on 
the phone and was told they couldnt advise him as he wasnt the account holder and the 
correct form to provide him with information wasnt signed. Mr L was told again someone 
would email him, but he never received a response.
Mr L submitted a complaint about this to NatWest on 7 June. Mr L complained that NatWest 
kept writing to his mother and explained that his mother relies on a carer to collect and read 
her mail and that she needed to go into care and needed the funds from her account to allow 
this to happen. Mr L asked if his mothers signature couldnt be validated to explain to him 
what was required as neither he nor his mother knew what in accordance with your current 
mandate meant. Mr L informed NatWest that he had her photo driving license and held a 
registered power of attorney for all financial matters for his mother. 
Mr L sent a further email to NatWest on 23 June emphasising the urgency of the matter but 
as NatWest failed to respond he brought a complaint to this service on his mothers behalf 
on 27 June.
Nationwide issued its final response letter by email dated 2 August. NatWest explained that 
it was unable to close the account as it did not currently hold Ms Ts signature on its records 
and that to complete the closure it would need Ms T to get a notary to certify her instruction 
and provided further information on what was needed.  NatWest agreed it couldve handled 
things better, apologised and offered £100 compensation for any inconvenience caused.
Mr L responded to this on 11 August explaining that he was acting on his mothers behalf as 
she had been admitted to hospital and was no longer able to physically respond or sign a 
further instruction. Mr L complained that it had taken 5 months since the closure request was 
sent for NatWest to advise that it didnt hold Ms Ts signature on file. Mr L failed to 
understand how NatWest cant verify his mothers identity when her instructions had been 
accepted for 28 years and felt the request to have her sign a further instruction witnessed by 
a Notary unreasonable.
NatWest responded explaining it requires a notary to witness Ms Ts signature for security 
purposes to protect her and the bank. NatWest says it can look to refund any fees for this if 
provided with evidence.
Sadly, Ms T died shortly after this and before her signature could be authenticated by a 
Notary and the account closed. This meant that NatWest was now unable to close Ms Ts 
account and release the funds without resealing the grant of probate for Ms Ts estate. 
Following bringing the complaint to this service NatWest have said that the reason it required 
a notary to certify Ms Ts signature was because it didnt hold her signature on record and 
couldnt act on the authority Ms T granted without it. Though NatWest accepts at some point 
it must have had Ms Ts signature.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ls concerns and reached the conclusion that as 
NatWest had been unable to show evidence of its internal policy requiring a customers 
signature to be certified by a notary they couldnt say NatWest had treated Ms T the same as 
other customers in similar circumstances and thought that NatWest should pay Ms Ts estate 
£100 compensation for the inconvenience caused.  
They didnt think it was unreasonable for NatWest to ask for further information before it 
closed Ms Ts account as it has a responsibility to protect customers accounts and it was 
unable to verify the late Ms Ts signature. 
Mr L disagreed, he says NatWest failed to tell him the reason for not releasing the funds was 
because it didnt hold Ms Ts signature and that it is NatWests fault it lost her signature. Mr L 
says by the time NatWest told him it didnt hold his mothers signature it was too late to do 
anything about it. 
Mr L says £100 compensation doesnt cover the costs of resealing the grant of probate and 
wants to be compensated for this, loss of interest and for NatWest to be sanctioned for its 
conduct which he judges to be deceitful and misleading.
Mr L has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
I issued my provisional decision in October 2023. In my provisional decision, I explained why 
I was proposing to uphold this complaint. I invited both parties to let me have any further 
submissions before I reached a final decision and both parties have confirmed and accepted 
my recommendations.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I said that:
I hope that Mr L wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed this complaint in the way 
that I have. Ours is an informal dispute resolution service, and Ive concentrated on what I 
consider to be the crux of the complaint. Our rules allow me to do that. And the crux of the 
complaint is that because NatWest no longer held Ms Ts signature and failed to explain this 
at the outset, Ms T was unable to remedy this and close her account before she died. This 
resulted in further delays and costs incurred because a resealed grant of probate was now 
required to close the account.
And having considered everything, Im currently minded to uphold this complaint, as I think 
NatWest has failed to provide a reasonable and timely service and as a direct result of this 
Ms Ts estate has incurred unnecessary costs.
The instruction to close Ms Ts account was sent on 18 April. Within this Mr L asked 
NatWest to respond by email to him. Unfortunately, for reasons that are unclear and through 
no fault of Ms T, NatWest no longer held or had access to her signature, so it wasnt able to 
authenticate that the instruction came from her and proceed with the closure of the account.
NatWest responded to Ms T by post regarding the instruction to close her account within 
what I consider a reasonable time on 5 May. And I dont think it was unreasonable that 
NatWest felt it couldnt follow its procedure to close the account or that it responded directly 
to Ms T, rather than just email Mr L. I say this as without her signature it was unable to verify 
the instruction came from her and I would expect it to take reasonable measures to 
safeguard its customers money.  
But I dont think NatWests letter was clear or helpful in explaining what it needed from Ms T 
to act on her instructions. As Like Mr L, Ive no idea what NatWest meant when it asked for 
a new closure authority signed in accordance with your current mandate. Or what NatWest 
required to progress the account closure. And although Im mindful of the fact NatWest 
wouldnt have been aware of Ms T personal circumstances at that time, I think taking into 
consideration Ms Ts age and the fact that shed authorised her son to act on her behalf 
shouldve put NatWest on notice that perhaps there was some urgency and that it would be 
prudent to keep Mr L informed as hed requested. 
So Mr L did what I think a reasonable person would do in these circumstances and called 
NatWest for clarification  twice on 24 and 26 May. But the response he got was as helpful 
as NatWests letter and Mr L got nowhere and received no response. So it being a matter of 
urgency he raised a complaint on 7 June within which he emphasised the urgency and asks 
NatWest what is needed and follows this up with a further email on 23 June. 
Yet Mr L nor Ms T received any further information or clarity on what was needed until 
NatWest issued its final response to the complaint on 2 August, over a month after hed 
called NatWest and over three months from when Ms T gave her closure instructions, by 
which point Ms T was no longer capable of signing documents and shortly after which she 
sadly died. 
This lack of response or clarity I think is a failing on NatWests behalf. And I think it needs to 
put things right. Usually, if I find a business has done something wrong or treated a customer unfairly, Id ask it to put the customer the position theyd be in if the mistake hadnt happened 
and I may award compensation that I think is fair and reasonable.
Unfortunately, in this case since Mr L raised the complaint Ms T has sadly died so it is not 
possible to put her in the place she would be if the mistakes hadnt happened and have her 
account closed without receiving the necessary legal documentation needed to close an 
account on the death of an account holder. In this case the foreign grant of probate needs to 
be re-sealed. I understand that has now been obtained, so Mr L has the requisite authority to 
deal with his mothers account and NatWest should now be able to close the account. 
So what I need to decide whether the outcome wouldve been any different if NatWest had 
been clearer in its response to the closure instruction and told Ms T exactly what it needed to 
verify her signature and if I think it would, what would be a fair and reasonable way of 
compensating Ms Ts estate for NatWests mistakes.
And I think the likely outcome wouldve been different. I think had Ms T been told by 
NatWest in its 5 May letter that she needed her signature to be authenticated by a Notary 
before it could act on her closure instruction there wouldve been time for this to be 
arranged. I say this because this was around three months before she died and I think its 
likely she was still capable of signing documents as only a couple weeks before this I can 
see she was able to execute a power of attorney in favour of her son, as well as providing 
instructions for closing her account.
So I think that if NatWest had been clear about what it needed from Ms T to close her 
account at the outset, Ms T wouldve been able  albeit likely with some help from her son  
to have her signature authenticated and her account closed prior to her death. And I think 
had this have happened this would have negated the need to have the grant of probate 
resealed in order to close the account. I say this as I can see from the late Ms Ts assets 
attached to the grant of probate that the only account she held in the UK was the one she 
held with NatWest. 
So on this basis I think NatWest should reimburse Ms Ts estate the cost for re-sealing the 
grant of probate on Mr L providing evidence of this. NatWest has said it was willing to 
reimburse Ms T for the costs involved in having her signature verified by a notary, so I think 
it is only fair and reasonable to extend that offer and to reimburse her estate for the costs of 
resealing the grant. 
And although Im unable to award Ms Ts estate any compensation for distress and suffering, 
I am mindful of the fact that NatWests failure to respond and constant delays has caused 
some inconvenience. So on this basis I think NatWest should further compensate the estate 
£200 for the administrative inconvenience.  I appreciate Mr L would like the estate to be 
compensated for loss of interest. But its not possible to say how much, if any the estate has 
lost in interest due to the delays or how the account funds wouldve been spent or invested. 
As both parties have accepted my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusions set out above. It follows that I uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold the estate of Ms Ts complaint and direct National 
Westminster Bank Plc to put things right as outlined above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Ms T 
to accept or reject my decision before 13 December 2023.
