The complaint
Miss C says Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss C took out a 24-month instalment loan for £1,500 from 118 118 Money on 4 March
2015. The monthly repayment was £118.75 and the total repayable was £2,850.
Miss C says 118 118 Money didnt ask what her income and expenditure was, and she
struggled to make the repayments.
Our adjudicator said Miss Cs complaint should be upheld. He said 118 118 Moneys checks
showed Miss C wouldnt have enough disposable income to cover any unexpected costs
and so there was a risk she would not be able to sustainably repay the loan.
118 118 Money disagreed. It said it had reviewed Miss Cs bank statements at the time and
was satisfied the loan was affordable. It no longer has copies of the statements due to the
age of the loan. It asked for an ombudsmans review.
I reached a different conclusion to the adjudicator so I issued a provisional decision (an 
extract follows and forms part of this final decision). I asked both parties to submit any 
comments or new evidence by 12 November 2021.
Extract from my provisional decision
Miss C says 118 118 Money didnt ask about her salary and expenses, but it has provided to
us the data she gave it when applying for the loan.
I can see it asked for her monthly income and expenditure. She declared these to be £1,143
and £785 (split across rent, council tax, utilities, food, credit repayments and insurance). 118
118 Money it says completed income verification with a third party, and this showed Miss Cs
income to be £1046. It checked Miss Cs credit file to understand her existing monthly credit
commitments and credit history. It says it also reviewed Miss Cs bank statements but no
longer has these.
From these checks combined 118 118 Money concluded Miss C had sufficient disposable
income to afford the loan.
I think these checks were proportionate given the value and term of the loan, and the stage
of the lending relationship. But unlike the adjudicator, I think 118 118 Money made a fair
lending decision based on the information it gathered that I have seen. After making the
repayment for this loan Miss C would be left with £142.25 disposable income each month. I
think this was sufficient in her circumstances to cover any unplanned costs or seasonal
expenses during a 24-month loan term  these would not occur every month. And the credit
check 118 118 Money carried out showed Miss C had no other debt or active credit accounts
when she applied for this loan. So there were no signs she was having problems managing
her money in any way. I cant know what the review of her bank statements showed, but
based on the available evidence I think it was fair for 118 118 Money to conclude Miss C
would be able to sustainable repay the loan.
I can see from the loan statement 118 118 Money provided Miss C went on to have
problems repaying the loan, and Im sorry she suffered financial difficulties. But for the
reasons set out above and based on the available evidence, I cant fairly conclude 118 118
Money should have made a different lending decision when she applied.
If Miss C is able to provide copies of the bank statements that she supplied to 118 118
Money I will of course review them to see if that changes my findings.
It follows I am not currently planning to ask 118 118 Money to take any action.
Neither party responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints is set out on our website and
Ive followed it here.
As neither party sent in any new comments or evidence I have no reason to change the 
findings or outcome I set out in my provisional decision. It follows I dont find 118 118 Money 
lent to Miss C irresponsibly and so I am not instructing it to take any action. 
My final decision
I am not upholding Miss Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 December 2021.
