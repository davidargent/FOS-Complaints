K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him 
irresponsibly. Mr P is represented by a third party.
background
A Loan table is attached to this decision. It has been  created using information from Sunny. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought that Sunny should put things 
right for Mr P in relation  to Loans  6 to 31. Sunny came back with an offer to put things right 
for Loans 20 to 31. Mr P declined  this. Sunnys concession on Loans 20 to 31 meant that 
I did not need to review  them as they were  not in dispute. They  are coloured  grey on the 
Loan Table. 
In relation to Mr Ps response to our adjudicators view,  he did not disagree  with the outcome 
for Loans 1 to 5 and so these were no longer disputed.
On 5 February 2020 I issued a provisional decision in which  I reviewed the undisputed loans 
- Loans  6 to 19. Its attached to this Final  Decision and forms part of it. I made a provisional 
decision not to uphold Loans 6 to 11 due to lack of information from Mr P. And that Sunny 
should put things right for Mr P in relation to Loans  12 to 19. 
Mr P accepted my provisional decision. Sunny did not and made many additional points.
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what I consider to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all the relevant rules,  guidance  
and good industry  practice - on our website. 
Sunny has said:
At the time of each  of Mr Ps loan applications, we determined that he had sufficient 
monthly disposable income for him to be able to make all of his loan repayments 
(and we took into account other  credit  he was already repaying), meet  his other  
reasonable commitments without him needing to borrow further to make  those 
repayments.
If you have received information  or evidence which indicates that he needed to 
borrow further in order to repay his Sunny Loans, please let us know.  Based  on our 
affordability assessment(s), there was no evidence to suggest  that he needed to 
borrow further from us
It is incorrect for FOS to assume that the number of Loans  granted by us alone, in 
the absence  of any other factors or evidence, necessarily impaired Mr Ps ability to 
access mainstream credit. Lenders use credit  information in different ways as part of 
their own assessments. If there  is evidence  that Mr P was declined  for mainstream 
credit, please provide this to us. 
Credit decisions are based  on a large number  of variables (as well as the amount(s)  
being applied for) which  lenders take into account, so it is not reasonable to conclude 
it is likely  that someone would be unable to access any forms of mainstream credit of 
any amount. Finally, if a customer  is declined for mainstream credit  because  of the 
Ref: DRN84803132Sunny Loans he was granted,  any unfair  treatment should arguably sit with other  
lenders, who are not taking into account how the customer  has managed  their Sunny 
loan repayments.
In the circumstances  we do not agree it was wrong to grant Loans 6  19 to Mr P, 
and would invite you to consider  reviewing  your decision. 
Ive considered the points Sunny has made.  
Sunny has had many decisions from this service in relation to complaints about  irresponsible 
lending and I invite it to look again at our website pages for high-cost credit which give 
detailed explanations of our approach. Some of this I set out again below. 
The Financial Conduct Authority wrote two Dear  CEO letters  dated  October  2018  and 
March 2019 which are relevant to Sunny as one of the regulated firms to which  these letters 
were addressed. The October 2018  letter says:
Firms complaint-handling procedures should  ensure that they can improve the way in which
they handle complaints, in the light of relevant  determinations by the Financial Ombudsman
Service (the Ombudsman) of complaints about  the firm.
We note that the Ombudsman has recently published four examples of determinations  of 
individual complaints about payday loans to illustrate its approach to the issues  raised in 
those complaints (see:  https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical.htm). 
If relevant,  firms  should take these examples of determinations into account  as part of
establishing their own effective procedures for complaints handling (see DISP  1.3.1R).
The March  2019  letter (which referred back to the October 2018 letter)  said, amongst other 
points, that two of the areas  to which the FCA was giving priority were relending and 
affordability. 
The CONC  provisions were altered in November 2018 but I have used the earlier  versions 
which were applicable to the loans  for Mr P approved by Sunny.
CONC 5.3.1(2)
The creditworthiness  assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customer's ability  to 
meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement  in a sustainable manner 
without the customer  incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse  
consequences.
[Note: paragraph 4.1 (box) and 4.2 of ILG]
Ref: DRN84803133Paras 4.1 (box)  and 4.2 ILG (original  emphasis retained) 
4.1 In the OFT's view, all assessments of affordability should involve a 
consideration of the potential for the credit  commitment to adversely  impact on the 
borrower's financial situation, taking account  of information that the creditor  is aware 
of at the time the credit is granted. The extent and scope of any assessment of 
affordability, in any particular circumstance, should  be dependent upon-  and 
proportionate to- a number of factors (see paragraph 4.10 of this guidance 
document).
BOX- 'Assessing affordability', in the context of this guidance, is a 'borrower-
focussed test' which involves a creditor assessing  a borrower's ability  to 
undertake a specific credit commitment, or specific additional credit 
commitment, in a sustainable manner, without the borrower incurring (further)  
financial difficulties and/or experiencing adverse consequences.
4.2 Whatever means and sources  of information  creditors employ as part of an 
assessment of affordability  should be sufficient to make an assessment of the risk of 
the credit  sought  being unsustainable  for the borrower in question. In our view this 
is likely  to involve more  than solely assessing the likelihood of the borrower being 
able to repay the credit in question. We consider that before granting credit, 
significantly increasing the amount of credit, or significantly increasing the credit  limit 
under an agreement for running account  credit, creditors should take reasonable 
steps to assess a borrower's likely ability to be able to meet  repayments  under the 
credit agreement in a sustainable manner.
Ive thought about this when coming to my decision and Im still satisfied that the manner in 
which Mr P was using these loans ought  to have led Sunny to conclude that he couldnt  
sustainably repay  loan 12 onwards. Mr P was borrowing extensively and repetitively from 
Sunny. There is evidence that he needed to borrow further, because he kept doing  exactly 
that for many months.
And I reiterate that by this point in the lending relationship it doesnt really  matter what 
Sunnys checks showed because  it needed to get a thorough understanding  of Mr Ps 
financial circumstances, which it didnt do. I dont think that Sunnys checks  meant  that it got 
a proper understanding of why it was Mr P needed  this many loans over this extended 
period; instead  it repeated the same or similar checks  to what  it had done  before.  So, Im 
satisfied that a pattern of lending had been established which  in itself ought to have led 
Sunny to conclude that further  credit  wasnt sustainable.
 
In granting these loans,  I think its more  likely  than not that these loans contributed  to Mr P 
not being able to access mainstream credit, so it is for this reason that we are asking for 
these loans to be removed from Mr Ps credit  file. 
 
Ive decided that from Loan 12, Sunny should put things right for Mr P. I include in the 
redress section the loans 20 to 31, on which Sunny  has conceded, for completeness. 
Ref: DRN84803134putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on Loans 12 to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 12 onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  Loans 12 to 31 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint in part and direct  that Elevate Credit  
International Limited, trading as Sunny, do as I have set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.

my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  I consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general  approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant  rules, guidance  and good industry 
practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly.  In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr P could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  consider  several different things,  such as how much 
was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include: where a 
customers income is particularly low; where  the repayments  are particularly high; and/or where the 
frequency of the loans  and the length of time over which a customer has been given loans need to be 
looked at: repeated  refinancing could signal  that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr P 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the ability to 
repay without  undue difficulties.  The customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having  to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
will not be able to make their repayments sustainably  if they need to borrow further in order to do that.
I have carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
By Loan 6 I think that the checks  proportionate to the application would have been for Sunny to have 
carried out a full financial  review of Mr Ps financial situation.  It was the sixth application  in a month 
and he still had two other loans outstanding when  he applied for Loan 6. Mr P had informed  Sunny 
that he earned £1,000 net a month  and that his total outgoings were  £539 including rent of £0. Sunny  
says that it did checks at the time, but Ive not been given any information about that. And Mr P gave 
us some details of what he terms his yearly income  and expenditure. 
He said: This was my yearly income and expenditure at the time of my first loan with Sunny. During 
additional loans, my income had not changed since then, although my yearly  rent amount did 
increase after May 2017 from £271.56 to £914.40 due to a career relocation. 
Mr P has told us that he earned £18,300 a year and has listed his other  expenditure  items (including  
his rent) as annual.  
Ref: DRN84803136I would have  preferred to have seen more information in the form of payslips  and bill copies  and other 
items from Mr P (or conveniently, copy bank statements covering the lending period)  in order to look 
to see what Sunny would have seen if it had carried out a full financial review. But we do not hold that 
information. I do have a copy of his credit file.
So, going on the information Mr P told Sunny and the information he has told us about  his 
circumstances at the time, then it appears he can afford these loans. I am planning  not to uphold the 
loans earlier in this relationship with Sunny.
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which it should reasonably  have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further  
loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 12. I say this 
because Mr P had borrowed  several times a month for January, February  and May 2017,  together 
with Loan 7 which was approved when  Mr P had three loans still outstanding, and Mr P took one in 
10 April 2017 when he had three outstanding still. And by the time Mr P applied for Loan 12 on 
31 May 2017 it was the largest  sum applied for up to that date (£400); and he was already indebted  to 
Sunny and had been for some time. This would have extended his indebtedness for several more 
months. And I think that Sunny ought to have  realised  that more  needed  to be looked into to check  
the sustainability of the lending. 
I think  that Mr P lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide  borrowing from Loan 12 to Loan 31 (of 
which Sunny  has conceded on Loans 20 to 31) because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on Mr 
Ps ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I am upholding the complaint about Loans 12 to 31 which includes the loans Sunny  has conceded 
on and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things  right  what I am planning to ask Sunny to do
refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on Loans 12 to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple a year*  on any refunded  interest  and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from Loan  12 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries  about Loans  12 to 31 should be removed  from Mr Ps credit 
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
