The complaint
Mr H complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) was 
irresponsible to lend to him. 
What happened
Mr H had four loans from MoneyBoat between May 2017 and October 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Scheduled 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 16 May 2017 £200 66d £83.64 21 Jul 2017 On time
2 24 Jul 2017 £400 122d £158.01 23 Nov 2017 On time
3 27 Nov 2017 £500 116d £192.71 23 Mar 2018 On time
4 8 Oct 2018 £300 137d £93.96 22 Feb 2019 Repayment plan
 
Mr H says he couldn't pay priority bills due to the high repayments on his loans and had to 
enter into a debt management plan in order to avoid becoming trapped in a debt cycle. He 
says his expenditure often exceeded his income, and he had multiple loans with other short-
term lenders. Mr H says better checks would have identified his dependency on the lending.
MoneyBoat says it asked Mr H about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. 
It says that based on the information it had, it found all the loans to be affordable and it 
considered it had carried out proportionate checks.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. He found that credit checks 
carried out by MoneyBoat showed Mr H had other outstanding short-term loans and that it 
should have realised it was unlikely Mr H could sustainably repay its loans.  Our adjudicator 
recommended interest and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) should be refunded on loans 
1 to 4 and that associated adverse information should be removed from his credit file.
MoneyBoat responded to say, in summary, that the checks it carried out were proportionate 
given the infancy of the lending relationship. It added that it would be unrealistic to expect an 
underwriter to go through every line of a credit file at this stage. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure  
Mr H could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr H was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks MoneyBoat had to do.
Loans 1, 2 and 3
I can see that MoneyBoat asked Mr H for information about his income and expenditure and 
that the calculated disposable income showed the repayments were affordable to him. But 
MoneyBoats credit check showed Mr H had four other outstanding short-term loans at the 
time and, from these alone, it should have at least realised hed understated his credit 
expenditure.
Given this information, I consider MoneyBoats checks should have gone further and that it 
should have asked Mr H about his other short-term lending before making its lending 
decision. Had it done so, I find it likely that MoneyBoat would also have found Mr H had 
taken out two further short-term loans in early May 2017 that were not yet reflected on 
the credit file.
So Im satisfied MoneyBoat should have seen there were clear indications Mr H was already 
struggling to manage his money when he applied for loan 1. I acknowledge that MoneyBoat 
says it does not expect its underwriters to go through every line of a credit report, especially 
in the early stages of a lending relationship. However, as the information about Mr H's other 
lending was readily available, I find it reasonable that it should have been taken into account 
when deciding whether a new loan should be approved and, in this case, I can't conclude 
loan 1 was likely to be sustainably repaid.
MoneyBoats credit checks for loans 2 and 3 continued to show Mr H had at least four other 
short-term loans outstanding each time and indicated that he was developing a level of 
dependency on such lending.
So I find it was irresponsible for MoneyBoat to have approved any of Mr H's first three loan 
applications.
Loan 4
There was more than a six-month gap between loans 3 and 4, so it was reasonable for 
MoneyBoat to consider this as a new chain of lending and decide on its proportionate checks 
accordingly. But again, MoneyBoat's credit check showed five other short-term loans were 
outstanding at the time.  If MoneyBoat had asked Mr H about this lending, its likely to have 
found that two of the loans had been repaid before Mr H applied for loan 4, but that hed also 
taken out a further short-term loan two weeks earlier which wasn't yet showing on the credit 
file.
So I consider MoneyBoat should have seen Mr H was still showing signs he was struggling 
to manage his money and I think it was irresponsible for it to have approved loan 4 as well 
as loans 1, 2 and 3.
My final decision
My decision is that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr H paid on loans 1 to 4;Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges for loan 4, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr H; 
Remove any negative information about loans 1 to 4 from Mr Hs credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
MoneyBoat intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it must do 
so after deducting the tax. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 July 2020.
