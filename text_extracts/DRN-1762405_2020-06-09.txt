The complaint
Mrs O has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA won't refund her for transactions she 
didn't make.
What happened
In December 2019 Mrs O asked the ombudsman service to sort out her complaint with 
PayPal.  There'd been three payments taken from her PayPal account without her authority 
in May 2019.  These transactions had been funded by Mrs O's linked debit card.
Mrs O had originally come to the ombudsman service in July 2019 to query these 
transactions.  PayPal had dealt with this complaint as a dispute over a chargeback.  They 
insisted Mrs O start the complaint procedure again if she wanted them to be considered as 
disputed transactions.
We contacted PayPal to tell them of Mrs O's most recent complaint.  On 3 January 2020 
PayPal sent Mrs O their final response.  They refunded the disputed funds of £860. Mrs O 
remained unhappy as this had gone on for quite a time.
Our investigator felt it would be fair for PayPal to pay Mrs O £150 for the delays and 8% 
simple interest on the disputed amounts from the date of the debit until the funds had been 
repaid. This was in line with our general approach.
PayPal objected to this outcome.  They argued at one stage that if Mrs O wanted 
compensation to be considered, she should make a further complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I've reached a similar 
conclusion as our investigator's.  I'll explain why
When the ombudsman service received Mrs O's original complaint in mid-2019, it was made 
clear to PayPal Mrs O was disputing transactions from her account which she believed were 
unauthorised. PayPal decided to treat this complaint as a chargeback issue.
I believe the fact these were transactions Mrs O believed were unauthorised should have 
alerted PayPal to their obligations under the Payment Services Regulations. So I don't 
agree it's true to say PayPal responded immediately to refund Mrs O. This happened only 
after we contacted them in December 2019 following the second complaint being opened.
 
Putting things rightLike our investigator I believe it's fair and reasonable Mrs O is compensated for the delay in 
getting her refund. Simple interest at 8% a year should be added to reflect the time Mrs O 
was without her own funds.
I also think £150 for the trouble caused is fair.  As PayPal knows we generally ask financial 
institutions to compensate customers when disputed transaction claims are not sorted.  
Particularly as in this case when PayPal could have decided to refund Mrs O in mid-2019 
rather than make her submit a second complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons I've given, my final decision is to instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
add 8% simple interest a year to £860 from 5 May 2019 until the date of settlement; 
and
pay Mrs O £150 for the trouble caused.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
