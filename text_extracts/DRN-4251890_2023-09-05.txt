The complaint
Mr M is unhappy with the service he received from Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 
118 Money surrounding an account arrears offer that they sent to him.
What happened
Mr M was £74.91 in arrears on his 118 118 credit account and received an offer from 118 
118 which stated that if he made a payment of £37.00 to his account, 118 118 would credit 
his account with the remaining £37.91 so that his account was no longer in arrears.
Mr M made the £37 payment to 118 118, but 118 118 didnt then credit the £37.91 to his 
account as theyd promised. And 118 118 also reported his account as continuing to be in 
arrears to Mr Ms credit file. Mr M wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
118 118 apologised to Mr M for not crediting his account with £37.91 as they should have 
done and confirmed to Mr M that they had now credited that amount to his account and had 
instructed the credit reference agencies to amend his credit file to show that he wasnt in 
arrears on his account for the month in question. Finally, 118 118 also credited a further £75 
to Mr Ms account as compensation for the trouble and upset hed incurred. 
Mr M wasnt satisfied with 118 118s response and wasnt happy that he kept receiving 
further arrears payment offers from 118 118 which he wasnt considered eligible for, given 
that only one offer was allowed per customer. So, he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that 118 118 had taken the 
corrective action to put Mr M into the position he should be in, had they credited his account 
with the £37.91 when they first should have done. But they didnt feel that the £75 further 
credit that 118 118 had paid to Mr M fairly recognised the impact these events had on Mr M. 
So, they recommended that 118 118 should pay Mr M a further £25. 
Mr M didnt feel the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator went far enough, 
so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where a business has made a mistake, as 118 118 accept that they did here by not crediting 
the £37.91 to Mr Ms account when they first should have done, what this service would 
expect would be that the business would take the corrective action necessary to restore the 
complainant to the position they should be in, had the mistake never occurred. 
118 118 appear to have done that here. I say this because 118 118 have now credited the 
£37.91 to Mr Ms account and have instructed the amendment of Mr Ms credit file to be as it 
should have been, had the £37.91 been credited to Mr Ms account correctly. Accordingly, 
Im satisfied that no further corrective action is reasonably required from 118 118 at this time. 
It would also be expected by this service that 118 118 would consider the impact of their 
mistake on Mr M and would compensate him for any trouble and upset he may have unfairly 
incurred as a result. And to that end 118 118 made a further credit of £75 to Mr Ms account. 
Our investigator didnt feel that this payment of £75 provided fair compensation to Mr M for 
everything that had happened, including that Mr M continued to receive further arrears 
payment offers from 118 118 that he wasnt eligible to benefit from. This was because 118 
118 only allow one arrears offer per customer and because Mr M had already accepted such 
an offer when he paid the £37. So, our investigator recommended that 118 118 should pay a 
further £25 to Mr M, taking the total compensation amount to £100.
Matters of compensation can be subjective. But the total compensation amount of £100, as 
recommended by our investigator, feels fair to me. I reach this position in consideration of 
the trouble and frustration Mr M incurred because 118 118 didnt apply the credit to his 
account when they should have done, and also in consideration of the continuing arrears 
payment offers that Mr M has received but cant accept, which I feel would be of detriment to 
Mr M given the anxiety and worry that being in arrears on an account often elicits. 
Finally, Ive also considered the general framework this service uses when assessing 
compensation amounts  details of which are on this services website. And taking all these 
factors into account, I feel that £100 is a fair amount.
All of which means that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr M favour and instructing 118 
118 to pay a further £25 to Mr M. 118 118 should also ensure that they send no further offers 
to Mr M that he isnt eligible to accept.
Putting things right
118 118 must make a payment of £25 to Mr M.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money on the basis explained above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 October 2023.
