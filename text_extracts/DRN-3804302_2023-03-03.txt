The complaint
Mr T is unhappy with the information MotoNovo Finance Limited recorded on his credit file 
when he was in financial difficulty.
What happened
In August 2019, Mr T was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo. The agreement was for a period of five years; with 59 monthly repayments of 
£319.70, and final repayment of £518.70.
Mr T said that MotoNovo reported missed payments on his credit file when hed made the 
payments on time. He said theyd reported missed payments for November 2021, December 
2021, January 2022, February 2022, and March 2022. Mr T provided a copy of his bank 
statement which showed payments to MotoNovo on 22 October 2021 for £639.40, 3 
December 2021 for £319.70, 31 December 2021 for £319.70, 1 February 2022 for £319.70, 
and 1 March 2022 for £639.40.
MotoNovo said Mr T missed a payment in July 2021 and they didnt report this to his credit 
file. They said he missed payments for July 2021, August 2021, and September 2021. They 
said he made a payment of £639.40 by card on 21 October 2021. They said this covered the 
payments for July 2021 and August 2021. They said he next made a payment of £319.70 on 
12 November 2021  they said this covered the September 2021 payment. The next 
payment was made on 2 December 2021 for £319.70. They said this covered the October 
2021 payment. The next payment was made on 30 December 2021. This was for £319.70 
and covered the payment for November 2021.
They said this meant the December 2021 payment was still outstanding. They said his 
account was seven months in arrears. They said six of these related to the payment 
deferrals that had been granted during the Covid 19 pandemic. This left the one missed 
payment that they said was correctly reflected on his credit report.
Unhappy with this, Mr T brought his complaint to this service. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ts complaint. She was satisfied that MotoNovo had 
reported accurate and factual information to Mr Ts credit files. She said in December 2021 
Mr Ts account was in arrears by one month and this would show on his credit file until it was 
paid. She said that Mr T had made two payments in February 2022 to cover the arrears. She 
said that adverse information had not been recorded from this point as the account had been 
brought up to date.
Mr T disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. He said that MotoNovo had 
acknowledged their error so his credit file should be amended to show he hadnt missed 
payments. MotoNovo confirmed there were no markers to remove on Mr Ts credit file and 
what was reported was a true and accurate reflection of how the account had been 
managed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and (if appropriate) what I 
consider was good industry practice at the time. Mr T was supplied with a car under a hire 
purchase agreement. This is a regulated consumer credit agreement which means were 
able to look into complaints about it. 
The hire purchase agreement includes a paragraph that advises Mr T that information will be 
shared with credit reference agencies. The agreement also includes a section advising what 
happens if payments arent made on their due date. It says:
We will contact you as soon as we can to let you know you have missed a payment, 
and to discuss how the payment can be made. If you do not bring the payment up to 
date, we will register an adverse record with the credit reference agency.
Lenders like MotoNovo supply information about credit agreements with credit reference 
agencies to show whether or not payment have been made on time. Its important that this 
data is accurate as it helps other lenders when they are making a decision to lend. If 
consumers like Mr T have a history of paying on time this may help them get further credit.
So the issue I have to consider is whether or not the information recorded by MotoNovo was 
accurate.
I can see for the statement of account that Mr T missed payments in the period October 
2020 to March 2021. Mr T was granted payment deferrals for the period October 2020 to 
March 2021 as he faced payment difficulties as a result of Covid-19. As I would expect, none 
of these deferrals have been recorded as missed  and is not the cause of this dispute.
He also missed payments covering the period July 2021 to September 2021.
Mr T has supplied a transaction history that shows five payments to MotoNovo between 22 
October 2021 and 1 March 2022. These payments are equal to seven monthly payments.
MotoNovo have explained how these payments were allocated. Ive considered this 
information alongside the information provided by Mr T. The table below helps illustrate how 
payments have been allocated: 
Month Amt paid M arrears Allocation
April 2021 £319.70 0 -
May 2021 £319.70 0 -June 2021 £319.70 0 -
July 2021 0 1 Paid Oct 21
August 2021 0 2 Paid Oct 21
September 2021 0 3 Paid Nov 21
October 2021 £639.40 2 Paid Dec 21
November 2021 £319.70 2 Paid Jan 22
December 2021 £319.70 2 Paid Feb 22
January 2022 £319.70 2 Paid Feb 22
February 2022 £639.40 1 Paid Mar 22
March 2022 £319.70 1 Paid April 22
April 2022 £320 1
Mr T said hed made all the payments to bring his account up to date. Ive considered the 
payment transaction history he provided and that matches the information on the statement 
of account provided by MotoNovo. And its this information Ive used to complete the table 
above. And Im satisfied that this demonstrates that Mr T remained one month in arrears 
after making the payments above. 
Credit reporting
Mr T is unhappy that MotoNovo have recorded the missed payments on his credit file. Im 
satisfied this was an appropriate action for them to take. As Ive explained above, Im 
satisfied that Mr T was still one payment in arrears. So the information they recorded with 
the credit reference agencies was accurate.
I understand why Mr T is concerned about the impact on his credit file. But creditors like 
MotoNovo have a responsibility to accurately report information to the credit reference 
agencies. Im satisfied that they acted appropriately by reporting a missed payment.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2023.
