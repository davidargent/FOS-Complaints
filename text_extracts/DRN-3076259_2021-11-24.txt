The complaint
Miss S complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) declined three transactions 
she attempted to a merchant but debited her account for them. And that PayPal didnt return 
the funds, despite explaining she couldnt provide the information it asked her for.  
What happened
In January 2021, Miss S attempted to use her PayPal account to pay for leaving gifts for two 
of her work colleagues. Her payment to the merchant went through for the first of her 
colleagues. But when she attempted to pay for a gift on the merchants website for the 
second colleague, this payment was declined. She attempted to try and pay for the gift on 
two more occasions, but the payment continued to get declined.
Miss S then used a different payment provider to pay for the gift. But she noticed her PayPal 
account had been debited for the three declined payments she had attempted earlier. 
Cumulatively, these payments amounted to around £30. 
Miss S then raised this issue with PayPal, it explained the payments were under review. 
Later, PayPal asked Miss S to provide it with the date of birth for the colleague who was the 
intended recipient of the gift Miss S had attempted to buy. 
Miss S was unhappy with this request as she didnt have the details PayPal was asking her 
for, nor did she think it was appropriate. Miss S also explained she wasnt making a payment 
to her work colleague but buying them a gift from a merchants website. 
PayPal said the payments were under review and reiterated it needed personal details for 
the recipient of the gift. Miss S complained to PayPal, who in turn said it had done nothing 
wrong. Miss S then referred her complaint to this service. 
PayPal returned the funds to Miss S in May 2021. 
Two of our investigators have looked into Miss S complaint. For simplicity, Ill summarise the 
most recent findings: 
- PayPals request for Miss S to provide her work colleagues date of birth wasnt an 
error. PayPal had correctly followed its internal security procedures in order to meet 
its wider legal and regulatory obligations.
- PayPal cant reasonably justify why it held on to Miss S funds for as long as it did. 
Miss S had explained why she couldnt provide the information PayPal asked her for 
from the offset. So PayPal should have begun the process of returning the funds 
back to Miss S shortly after. 
- PayPal should pay Miss S £75 for the distress and inconvenience it cause Miss S. 
Miss S agreed with what our investigator said. PayPal said its actions were correct, and it did 
not have an obligation to return the funds to Miss S without the required information being 
provided. 
The matter has now been passed to me to decide.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to partially uphold this complaint. Ill explain why. 
Ive carefully read PayPals terms and conditions and what they say about refusing to make 
a payment and when it can hold and limit funds. Having done that, I can understand why 
PayPal says it has not done anything wrong by holding onto Miss S funds for as long as it 
has  and asking her for information about the recipient of the gift she was attempting to buy. 
I also can see why Miss S found it difficult to understand why she was being asked to 
provide personal information about a work colleague she was buying a gift for. The 
payments she was attempting to make were to a merchant for a relatively small value gift. 
So its difficult to see why PayPal blocked and then debited her account for these payments  
and then held onto them for around five months.  
PayPal has legal and regulatory obligations it must meet, and it has explained why they took 
this course of action. I am under no legal obligation, that Im aware of, to disclose this. But 
Im satisfied it had reason to initially decline these payments and ask Miss S information 
about them. 
But given Miss S explained what the payments were for; they were to a merchant for a low 
value gift; that she couldnt get the personal information for the work colleague who was 
leaving, Im persuaded PayPal should have released funds back to Miss S much sooner 
than it did.
PayPal say it decided to return the funds as an exception to its common practice  in other 
words, a goodwill gesture. But as Ive said it should have done this sooner as a fair and 
reasonable measure.  To have held onto them for around five months is far too long in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Miss S has explained this matter has caused her distress by way of affecting her mental 
wellbeing. Shes also explained that complaining and chasing the return of her funds has 
caused inconvenience. Im satisfied PayPals holding onto her money for an unreasonable 
period would have caused some distress and inconvenience. Because of that PayPal should 
pay Miss S £75 compensation.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part, and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Miss S 
£75 compensation for the reasons Ive explained above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
