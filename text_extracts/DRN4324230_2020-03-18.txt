K822xcomplaint
Mrs N is unhappy  with the service she received from National 
Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) when she tried to add her 
daughter as a third party to her account.
background 
In February  2019,  Mrs N went  to a NatWest branch with her 
daughter. Mrs N says that with her health problems and 
disability it is at times difficult for her to get to the bank herself,  
so she wanted to add her daughter to her account as a third 
party. This would allow her daughter, on her behalf, to collect  
her pension. 
NatWest didnt add Mrs Ns daughter as a third party  to the 
account and in March 2019, they wrote to Mrs N and explained 
that the identification her daughter had, when they visited  the 
branch in February 2019, was not sufficient. They explained 
what documents  Mrs Ns daughter would need. NatWest  also 
credited Mrs Ns account with £11 to cover the transport to and 
from the branch.  
Mrs N says that when she went with her daughter to the branch 
for the second time, this time with the correct identification  
requested by NatWest, they were  turned away again. 
Mrs N says this has caused  her further distress and 
inconvenience.
In April 2019,  NatWest explained that they looked to see what 
happened during the second visit, but their branch couldnt  
recall this visit so they agreed  with Mrs Ns version of events. 
NatWest credited Mrs Ns account with £22 to cover the travel 
costs for that visit and the future visit Mrs N would  have to 
make to the branch. They  have also credited Mrs Ns account 
with £50 for the distress  and inconvenience caused.
Ref: DRN43242302Mrs N was not happy with this as she thought the 
compensation shouldve been higher, so she referred  her 
complaint to our service. Our investigator was of the opinion  
that NatWest  should  increase the compensation by a further 
£50. NatWest agreed to pay the further £50, but Mrs N 
disagreed with the investigator. So the complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision.    
my findings
Ive considered  all the available evidence and arguments  to 
decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion 
as our investigator.
Mrs N says that the amount  of compensation offered by 
NatWest doesnt fully reflect  the extent  of the distress and 
inconvenience caused, and the costs incurred. She says that 
as a wheelchair user, a lot of effort and time goes into planning 
and preparing a journey a disabled person has to make. She 
says that ordering a taxi adapted to her needs is difficult at best 
of times, and that she has suffered  pain and discomfort. She 
feels that NatWest had a lack of compassion  and 
understanding. In addition, she says that she was 
inconvenienced more than once and overall the level of 
compensation doesnt reflect  the problems she has 
encountered and the impact this had on her. 
In February  2019,  the first time Mrs N came into the branch, her 
daughter had a work pass  and two statements. Looking at what  
identification was required, Im satisfied that NatWest was 
unable to add Mrs Ns daughter as a third party  to the account.  
So I cant  reasonably  say that it was an error by NatWest that 
inconvenienced Mrs N the first time she visited the branch. And 
Ref: DRN43242303even thought  it was not their error, NatWest still paid Mrs N £11 
to cover her and her daughters travel  expenses for this visit. 
The second time Mrs N and her daughter attended the NatWest  
branch, Mrs N says that her daughter already  had the correct 
identification with her, but NatWest  still didnt add her as a third 
party to the account. NatWest said that their branch couldnt 
recall this visit, but they agreed  with Mrs Ns version of events. 
They credited Mrs Ns account with £11 to cover the travel 
costs for this specific visit and a further £11 pounds to cover the 
travel costs of a future visit Mrs N and her daughter might 
make. They have also paid Mrs N £50 for the distress and 
inconvenience. Later when the complaint was with our service, 
NatWest agreed to increase this compensation by a further 
£50. This is in addition to the £11 that NatWest paid Mrs N to 
cover the travel costs of the first visit in February  2019. So 
overall, NatWest  agreed  to compensate Mrs N a total of a 
£133.  
I realise Mrs N, when she visited  NatWest for the second time 
with her daughters correct identification, experienced distress 
and inconvenience,  but I think the £133 compensation offered 
by NatWest  is a fair reflection of the distress and inconvenience 
that has been caused. It also covers the travel expenses she 
has incurred for that specific  visit. So whilst I realise that my 
decision will come as a disappointment  to Mrs N, I think the 
compensation offered is fair and reasonable  considering the 
circumstances of her complaint.
I understand  that Mrs N says that her daughter has also 
suffered distress and inconvenience.  But this is the subject of a 
separate complaint  with our service, so I wont  be addressing 
the issue in this decision.
Ref: DRN43242304my final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that total 
compensation of £133 is fair and reasonable. I understand 
National Westminster Bank  Plc already paid £83 to Mrs N, so it 
should now pay her the other £50.
Under the rules of the Financial  Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Mrs N to accept or reject  my decision before 18 
April 2020
