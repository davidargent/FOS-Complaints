The complaint
Mr W complains Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax closed his accounts and didnt 
return his money. Mr W is represented by his father, Mr F.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr W is a child. He had two accounts with Halifax which were controlled by Mr F. In 
June 2022 Halifax decided to end its relationship with Mr F, which included closing his 
account and those of Mr W. 
I considered this matter separately and concluded it was fair and reasonable for Halifax to 
decide to end its relationship with Mr F. As Mr Ws accounts were controlled by Mr F, I find it 
was fair and reasonable for Halifax to close Mr Ws accounts too. 
Mr F is concerned Halifax retained Mr Ws money. Im not persuaded thats the case. I say 
this because I can see the balances from both of Mr Ws accounts were transferred into 
Mr Fs account, and then the full balance of Mr Fs account paid to Mr F. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F, on behalf of 
Mr W, to accept or reject my decision before 25 May 2023.
