The complaint
Mr R makes a number of complaints about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
following account blocks applied to his account.
What happened
Mr R says his account has been blocked following attempted payments whilst abroad. He 
says he has been forced into expensive telephone calls to NatWest about the blocks. Mr R 
says he doesnt know in advance how long he will be on hold to NatWest and says he didnt 
receive text messages from it about the blocks. In summary Mr R would like compensation 
for what has taken place and for NatWest to make its systems easier to use. He also 
complains about the effectiveness of NatWests chat system and has provided video 
evidence confirming he didnt receive text messages.
NatWest says its entitled in line with agreed account terms and conditions to block an 
attempted payment when its security systems raise fraud concerns. It says calls to its 
number are free but says a mobile telephone provider may impose charges. NatWest 
accepts it made mistakes dealing with Mr Rs new account card and has paid £150 
compensation in total for that and for other issues. It says that some of the transactions were 
declined by its systems due to the way in which the merchant tried to process them.
Mr R brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to block a payment where it had security concerns in line with 
account terms and conditions. The investigator thought NatWests telephone number was 
free.
Mr R doesnt accept that view and says NatWests customer service is inadequate and says 
NatWest agreed it treated him badly. He says NatWest has violated its own terms and 
conditions by not sending him the text messages and refused to call him. Mr R questions if 
NatWest receives some of the cost of calling it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint by paying an appropriate compensation amount and by apologising to Mr R. I 
appreciate Mr R will be disappointed by my decision and also appreciate how strongly he 
feels about took place. I make clear to Mr R that I dont intend to comment on every aspect 
of this complaint but deal with what I consider to be the main issues.
I am sure Mr R appreciates that fraud is a major problem for banks and building societies. 
And that they must have fraud and security measures in place to protect its and its 
customers money. That means on occasions legitimate transactions and genuine customers 
are caused inconvenience when such transactions are held pending security checks. I 
appreciate in those circumstances that Mr R spent some time trying to call NatWest and 
appreciate his concern about the call waiting time as well as the cost. But I dont think it 
follows that NatWest made a mistake or acted unfairly by placing the account restrictions on 
Mr Rs account and am satisfied that its entitled to do so in line with agreed account terms 
and conditions. Im also satisfied that such restrictions are placed to protect, as in this case, 
Mr Rs account.
I have not seen any evidence that NatWest makes a charge to call its fraud department and 
think it more likely that its Mr Rs telephone provider that has imposed charges. I cant fairly 
hold NatWest responsible for those costs and have not seen any evidence that it benefits 
from the calls as Mr R questions.
I also appreciate Mr R has provided evidence that his telephone doesnt have a record of 
some of the text messages from NatWest. But equally NatWest says it sent them. I dont 
think this is the main part of the complaint and cant see how the outcome would have been 
any different as Mr R would have still needed to have called NatWest. And I cant hold 
NatWest responsible for the delivery of text messages in any event.
There is no question here that NatWest didnt deal with parts of this complaint as it should. In 
summary it accepts mistakes were made with the sending of a new card and accepts Mr R 
was waiting too long when he called it. But Im satisfied that NatWest has fairly apologised 
for the mistakes it made and for the length of time Mr R was waiting to speak to its fraud 
team. Im also satisfied the overall compensation offer of £150 is fair and reasonable and in 
line with the type of awards we would make in these circumstances.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has fairly apologised and paid appropriate compensation. I 
hope Mr R appreciates that we are not NatWests regulator and so we cant direct it to 
change the way in which it operates such as calling a customer back or how its chat facility 
works. It is also not our role to comment on NatWests customer service generally.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2022.
