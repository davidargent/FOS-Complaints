K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains about the amount that hes been charged by ALD Automotive Limited, 
trading as Ford Lease, for damage  to a car that he returned at the end of his hire agreement. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator so I wont repeat them again  here. Instead Ill focus on giving  the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
the car was inspected  by a third party on behalf of Ford Lease in November 2018  
when Mr Ns hire agreement  ended  and three  scratched  alloy wheels were identified  
for which a charge  of £150 was recommended;
Ford Lease  charged  him £150  but he says that theres a strong  possibility that theres 
a design fault with the wheels and that £50 to repair a few surface  scratches on each 
of the three wheels  is completely unreasonable;
Mr N agreed  in the hire agreement  that he would return the car in a state of repair 
and condition that was consistent  with its age and mileage, assuming good treatment 
and allowing for fair wear  and tear, and that he would pay Ford Lease all sums  
necessary to restore the car to that condition, including rectifying any wheel damage;
I consider it to be clear from the photos  in the vehicle condition  report that three of 
the cars  alloy wheels  were damaged  when  the car was returned  by Mr N and that 
the damage was more  than would reasonably be considered  to be fair wear  and tear;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that theres  a design fault 
with the wheels or that the charge  thats  been made  by Ford Lease for the damage  is 
excessive or unreasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Ford Lease to waive  or 
reduce the amount that its charged Mr N for the damage to the car or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
