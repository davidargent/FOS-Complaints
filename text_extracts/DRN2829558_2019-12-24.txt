K821x#15Complaint
Mr X complains that National Westminster Bank Plc stopped sending  him statements in 
2017. 
Background
On 30 August 2017 NatWest sent Mr X a text message and asked him to get in touch as it 
hadnt been able to deliver some post.  Mr X visited a local branch and asked about the text. 
He says he gave  the counter staff his drivers  licence and was told that the address issues 
on his account  had been resolved. 
Despite visiting the branch,  NatWest didnt start sending Mr X statements again. Several 
months later Mr X contacted NatWest via its app but says the situation continued. 
Mr X says the issues he was experiencing with his statements meant he wasnt  able to open 
an account elsewhere as he couldnt verify  his address. 
In May 2018  Mr X called NatWest to enquire  about  his expiring debit card.  A new card was 
sent to Mr X and he raised a complaint. Mr X discussed his concerns with a complaint 
handler and they arranged  for paper statements to be sent again but didnt uphold  his 
complaint. 
Mr X referred his concerns to our service and his complaint was passed to an investigator. 
The investigator upheld  Mr Xs complaint and NatWest agreed  to pay him £100. But Mr X 
didnt accept and asked to appeal. Mr X thought  a figure of £1,000 was reasonable as it took 
into account the costs  hed incurred  for printing and using the internet  to access his account 
as well as the time hed spent dealing with NatWest. As Mr X didnt accept the investigators 
view his complaint has been passed  to me to make a decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr X is upset. Hes told us that he took quick action to contact 
NatWest after he received text messages about his address in August 2017 by visiting a 
branch. Mr X says he was told that the situation  had been resolved after he showed staff his 
drivers licence and debit  card and his statements would be posted out to him. Its clear  that 
didnt happen  and an opportunity to resolve this situation was missed. 
However, NatWest says it took the decision to stop sending Mr X post because mail it sent 
couldnt be delivered to him and was returned. NatWest has explained that its policy is to 
suspend postal correspondence if mail is returned undelivered. NatWest sent Mr X text 
messages which  prompted him to get in touch. I think NatWests initial decision to suspend  
post was reasonable. I note Mr Xs view that the situation was manufactured so it could 
switch him over to paperless statements but I havent found any evidence  to support that. 
That being  said,  I agree  NatWest should have started sending statements again after Mr X 
visited the branch.  
Ref: DRN28295582Mr X contacted NatWest  again in May 2018 and complained.  Ive listened to Mr Xs 
complaint call. I know hes upset about  how the call was handled. But I didnt find that the 
call handler was rude or that she raised  her voice. Its clear  Mr X remained unhappy  during 
the call and I agree the call handler didnt find in his favour, despite being told that he had 
tried to resolve the situation months earlier in branch. But overall  I thought the call was 
professionally handled.  
Mr X says that hes been held hostage by NatWest for an extended  period as he needed 
bank statements to open another account  elsewhere. I take Mr Xs point, but there  are a 
range of options available to verify an address.  Mr X says he only had access to bank 
statements. But I note hes told us he used the photo card part of his drivers licence when 
he visited NatWests branch in August 2017. Drivers licences are generally accepted as 
proof of address,  in much the same way as bank statements for instance. In addition,  some 
businesses will conduct a credit search in place of requesting documents to verify an 
address. So whilst I dont  doubt that Mr X could have used NatWests statements  to open an 
account elsewhere, Im not persuaded that was the only option.
In response to the investigator, Mr X says he should be able to recoup reasonable costs and 
I agree.  But Mr X hasnt  provided any evidence of the costs hes incurred. I accept that Mr X 
had to use the internet to access his account online and that he had to make  phone calls to 
NatWest about the situation. And its clear  that he has spent time contacting NatWest to find 
out why he wasnt  being sent statements. Ive taken everything hes told us about the impact 
of NatWests error, the time hes spent  and the costs  hes had to pay into account when 
deciding how to fairly resolve Mr Xs complaint. 
Mr X says the problems  have gone on for two years. But the statements were suspended in 
August 2017 and Mr X complained in May 2018.  At that point, NatWest  started  sending  Mr X 
paper statements again. NatWest issued  a final response to the complaint a short time later. 
I appreciate there were delays within our service  but I cant  hold NatWest responsible for 
that. From the information provided it appears the problems  covered a period of around 10 
months, the time between Mr Xs visit to branch  on 30 August 2017  and his complaint to 
NatWest in May 2018. 
NatWest sent Mr X text messages and hes told us that he never consented  to receive  
contact that way. But NatWest has provided  systems evidence to show it would text Mr X 
about his account if it needed to make contact.  Whilst I understand Mr X didnt want  to 
receive texts, Im satisfied  NatWest  was contacting him in line with the communication 
preferences it held.  
Mr X told our investigator  that he was unable to manage  his account during this period as he 
didnt have up to date statements. But NatWest has sent in evidence  to show that Mr X was 
monitoring his account online  during  the period in question. So whilst I agree Mr X didnt 
receive statements  for an extended period,  Im satisfied he was able to check  his account. 
Ive considered everything that Mr X has told us about the effects of NatWests  error. Im 
sorry to disappoint  Mr X as I can see how strongly  he feels in this matter.  But I think  £100 
reflects the impact of NatWests error and is fair in all the circumstances. I agree with the 
investigator that this complaint should  be upheld and that NatWest  should pay Mr X £100. .
Ref: DRN28295583My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr X £100.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr X to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 January 2020.
