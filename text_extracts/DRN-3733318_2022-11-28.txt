The complaint
Miss M complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Oodle Financial Services Limited, trading as Oodle Car Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss M under a hire purchase agreement with Oodle Car 
Finance that she electronically signed in December 2021. She says that car suddenly lost 
power when she was driving it on a motorway in March 2022 so she took it to a garage and 
the glow plugs were replaced. The car continued to have power issues so Miss M took it to a 
manufacturers dealer. It replaced the glow plug relay which was paid for under the cars 
warranty but said that the car was still lacking power and it identified an issue with the diesel 
particulate filter which it said would need to be replaced. 
Miss M contacted the supplying dealer and it arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert. The supplying dealer refused to pay for the replacement glow plugs or a 
replacement diesel particulate filter so Miss M complained to Oodle Car Finance. Oodle Car 
Finance arranged for the car to be inspected by another independent expert in May 2022. It 
then said that it would provide Miss M with £150 to get the car recovered to a local specified 
garage and a further £85 for a chemical clean of the diesel particulate filter. Miss M didnt 
accept its offer and complained to this service. She says that she wants to reject the car.
Our investigator recommended that Miss Ms complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt 
think that the car was of a satisfactory condition when it was provided because of the diesel 
particulate filter fault but he thought that Oodle Car Finances offer to cover the recovery and 
repair costs was fair. He said that it had paid Miss M £1,225 towards the cost of a hire car 
but it wouldnt be fair to ask it to continue paying for a hire car. He said that the issues with 
the car had had a significant impact on Miss Ms finances and the lack of a car meant that 
she lost her job so he recommended that Oodle Car Finance should pay her £300 for the 
distress and inconvenience that shes been caused. 
Miss M has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that Oodle Car Finance didnt offer to replace the glow plugs, her credit score has 
been impacted and she shouldnt have to pay for the car which remains with the 
manufacturers dealer. She says that shes been contacted by bailiffs and the car will need 
an MOT test. 
Oodle Car Finance has accepted our investigators recommendations and has agreed, as a 
gesture of goodwill, to cover the cost of the MOT test and it says that, if the car fails that test, 
it will consider Miss Ms request for it to pay for any further repairs at that point.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Oodle Car Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss M was about four years old, had been driven for 
more than 43,000 miles and had a price of £17,980;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Miss M in December 2021 and she was able to use it without 
any reported issues until March 2022 when she says that it suddenly lost power 
when she was driving it on a motorway;
she took the car to a garage and it replaced the cars glow plugs but the car 
continued to have power issues so Miss M took it to a manufacturers dealer;
the manufacturers dealer replaced the glow plug relay - which was paid for under the 
cars warranty - but it said that the car was still lacking power and it identified an 
issue with the diesel particulate filter which it said would need to be replaced; 
Miss M then contacted the supplying dealer and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert in April 2022;
the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 47,297 miles and identified that 
there was a distinct lack of power from the car which could be caused by a diesel 
particulate filter issue, but it said: Due to the time which has elapsed and the 
mileage the vehicle has covered since finance inception we would not consider the 
reported faults to have been present or developing at that time and the selling agents 
have no responsibility in this matter - so the supplying dealer refused to pay for the 
replacement glow plugs or a replacement diesel particulate filter;
Miss M then complained to Oodle Car Finance and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by another independent expert in May 2022;
the inspection report said: DPF issues are common and from time to [time] requires 
specialist cleaning and regenerating which we believe is the cause of the underlying 
symptoms at the time of the inspection. Therefore we are recommending that the 
DPF is taken to a suitably qualified repairer for the DPF not only to be regenerated 
but to be cleaned; this should be classed as a routine maintenance issue not a direct 
result of a manufacturing defect;
relying on the findings of the two independent inspection reports, Oodle Car Finance 
offered to pay Miss M £150 to get the car recovered to a local specified garage and a 
further £85 for a chemical clean of the diesel particulate filter  it had also reimbursed 
her for the costs that shed incurred in hiring a car;
that offer wasnt accepted by Miss M and Oodle Car Finance has now agreed to pay 
to Miss M an additional £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes been caused and, as a gesture of goodwill, to cover the cost of an MOT test for 
the car and, if the car fails that test, it will consider Miss Ms request for it to pay for 
any further repairs at that point;
I consider it to be more likely than not there was an issue with the cars diesel 
particulate filter when the car was supplied to Miss M and that that issue caused the 
car not to have been of satisfactory quality at that time;the car has been inspected by two independent experts who have identified that the 
car has a lack of power which is related to diesel particulate filter issues and the May 
2022 report recommended that the diesel particulate filter should be regenerated and 
cleaned;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Oodle Car Finance to rely on the 
findings of the two independent inspection reports and to offer, in June 2022, to pay 
Miss M £150 to get the car recovered to a local specified garage and a further £85 for 
a chemical clean of the diesel particulate filter  and it had also reimbursed her for 
the costs that shed incurred in hiring a car  but I agree with our investigator that it 
should also have offered to pay some compensation to Miss M for the distress and 
inconvenience that shed been caused;
Miss M has described the significant issues that shes experienced with her health, 
her financial situation and losing her job  and shes also had issues with the car and 
I recognise that it must have been distressing for her when the car lost power when 
she was driving it on a motorway  I sympathise with her for all of those issues but 
she didnt accept the offer that Oodle Car Finance had made to her in June 2022 
and, as a result of that, the diesel particulate filter hasnt been cleaned and the car 
remains with the manufacturers dealer;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Oodle Cr Finance to pay Miss M £300 to 
compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused but Im 
not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to reimburse her 
for any further hire costs, to waive or refund any payments that were due from her 
under the hire purchase agreement or remove any adverse information about the 
agreement that it may have recorded on her credit file;
the cars glow plugs were replaced by a garage and the glow plug relay was replaced 
by the manufacturers dealer under the cars warranty  Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that theres an ongoing issue with the cars glow 
plugs but Oodle Car Finance has agreed, as a gesture of goodwill, to cover the cost 
of an MOT test for the car and, if the car fails that test, it will consider Miss Ms 
request for it to pay for any further repairs at that point  I consider that to be fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Oodle Car 
Finance to reimburse Miss M for the cost that she incurred in paying for the glow 
plugs to be replaced or to require it to pay for any other repairs to the car  and nor 
am I persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Oodle Car 
Finance to allow Miss M to reject the car; and
I suggest that, if she hasnt already done so, Miss M contacts Oodle Car Finance to 
discuss her financial difficulties and her options under the hire purchase agreement  
its required to respond to her financial difficulties positively and sympathetically.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Oodle Car Finance to 
make the payments to Miss M that it offered her in June 2022 and to also pay her £300 to 
compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ms complaint in part and I order Oodle Financial Services 
Limited, trading as Oodle Car Finance, to:
1. Make the payments that it offered to Miss M in June 2022.2. Pay £300 to Miss M to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 December 2022.
