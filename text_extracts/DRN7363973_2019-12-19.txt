K821x#15Complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) mis-sold him payday  loans 
and didnt treat him fairly. 
 
Background
Mr M took 40 instalment  loans (many of which overlapped) from Sunny between June 2015 
and December 2017. And a summary  of Mr Ms borrowing, based on the information 
provided to us from Sunny, can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
In our adjudicators latest findings  he thought Sunny had treated Mr M fairly when it gave him 
loans 1  4. However, he didnt think that any of the remaining loans shouldve been  
provided.  
By loan 5, the adjudicator  thought Sunnys checks needed to go further.  And had further 
checks been carried out it wouldve likely  shown Sunny that Mr M wasnt in a position to take 
on this loan or any of the remaining loans because he had a number of outstanding short 
term loans with other lenders at the time.  
The adjudicator also thought a pattern of lending had been  established  by loan 13 so as 
well, and as there was no change in Mr Ms circumstances, he didnt think he could  afford to 
take on any of the remaining loans. 
Mr M appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings.  
However, Sunny didnt  accept the adjudicators findings. It made a number of points 
including that it carried out affordability  checks and the information it received suggested 
these loans were affordable for Mr M. But it did accept that the way Mr M used  these may 
have been an indication of a problem,  so it made  an offer to uphold  loans 19  40. 
Mr M rejected Sunnys offer and as no agreement could be reached, the case  has been 
passed to me for a final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Both Mr M and Sunny appear  to have accepted the adjudicators findings about loans 1  4. 
Because there doesnt appear  to be an outstanding dispute about  these loans  I wont  be 
making a finding  on these  loans in this decision.  
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to figure out whether 
Mr M could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
Ref: DRN73639732mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr M could sustainably  repay  his loans   not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr M could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 5 - 12 would most likely  have  
shown that:
Mr M already had a number of outstanding short term credit commitments with other  
lenders at the time loan 5 was approved. And this didnt improve going forward.  So, 
this ought to have alerted Sunny to the fact that Mr M had to borrow in order  to fill a 
hole left in his finances and to bridge the gaps  between  paydays.  And knowing this, 
there was a significant risk that these  loans couldnt  be repaid sustainably, without 
undue difficulty or without the need to borrow again. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 - 12 and Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
Ive not recreated individual income  and expenditure for each  of the following loans,  as I 
dont think it is necessary. Instead  Ive looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending 
history with Mr M and I also think that Sunny should reasonably have seen that he was 
unlikely to have  been able to make his loan repayments in a sustainable manner by the time 
it provided loan 13. I say this because:
by this stage, Mr M had taken 13 loans  in a little under  five months.  In my view, 
Mr Ms loan history  up until this point was in itself a clear demonstration of his 
inability to settle his loans  over the life of the credit agreement.
Ref: DRN73639733Mr M continued  to be provided  with new loans shortly after having repaid previous 
ones for example loan 19 was taken a matter of days  after loans 16  18 had been 
repaid. And the amounts he was borrowing werent decreasing. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further to cover  
the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in his finances  and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness wasnt decreasing and so the loans  were  unsustainable. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed Sunny and his indebtedness  
was being prolonged  for an extended period of time. Loan 40 was provided more 
than two years after Mr Ms first loan and it his combined outstanding balance at the 
time was almost the same amount as Mr Ms first loan. This meant  that Mr M paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect;  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny provided  loans 13 - 40 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; 
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Ms complaint and Sunny should put things right as set out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  5 to 40;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 - 12 from Mr Ms credit file
remove all entries about  loans 13 - 40 from Mr Ms credit file. The period of time Mr M 
owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans is 
adverse.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN73639734My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 January 2020.
