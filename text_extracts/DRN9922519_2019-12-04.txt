K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs F have  complained they were incorrectly informed by Old Mutual  Wealth  Limited 
in November 2018 that they could part-surrender the two remaining segments of an 
endowment savings policy - the Maximum Investment Plan (MIP) - to the value of £100,000.   
But, when they came to request these funds  in mid-January 2019 to settle  a bill for building 
works, Old Mutual notified them 10 days later that the policys terms and conditions  didnt 
allow them to part-surrender  it. As the policy had been fully paid-up since  2014,  they could 
only surrender whole segments. And, as the segments  were  worth approximately £100 and 
£244,000 respectively at the time, they had no option by then other than to surrender the 
larger segment or the policy in full.
In doing so, Mr and Mrs F have released a tax-exempt sum of over £144,000 they didnt 
need and which they would have  wanted  to leave  in the MIP until it matured in January 
2022. They  have  since held it in a taxable deposit  account while  they decide how it might be 
reinvested. In the meantime, they have lost investment growth and valuable  tax benefits on 
this sum of money. 
Mr and Mrs F say that, if theyd been told in November 2018 that they would need to fully 
surrender the larger segment in order to release  £100,000, they could have  agreed  a revised 
payment plan with their builder and raised the exact  amount they needed from Mr Fs self-
invested personal pension (SIPP) across two tax years. But, by January 2019, there was no 
time to make  alternative arrangements and they have a substantial tax and reinvestment  risk 
on approximately £144,000 of their savings.   
background
Mr and Mrs F had taken  out the MIP in 1990 which comprised 12 policy  segments. When 
they stopped premium  payments in January 2014,  the policy became fully paid-up and Old 
Mutual confirmed to them that, under  its terms and conditions,  they could surrender whole 
segments, but they couldnt part-surrender the whole policy. 
By November 2018, Mr and Mrs F had surrendered  10 segments, leaving two segments in 
place, worth around £100 and £244,000  respectively. They  contracted with a builder  in July 
2018, with payment to be made  to him from their cash  savings in stages from August 2018. 
The final payment of the total bill of £97,000  was made in March 2019. In the meantime, they 
planned to replenish their cash savings in early 2019, either from the MIP, or by drawing 
down Mr Fs SIPP  which  wasnt the favoured option  as it incurred a substantial tax liability.
Mr F called Old Mutual in November 2018 and was informed that they could  part-surrender  
the MIP for £100,000, providing  they did so at the policy anniversary in January 2019 which 
was exactly when Mr and Mrs F needed  the funds. But this information was incorrect  - they 
could have part-surrendered the policy if premium payments  were  up-to-date.  But, as the 
policy was fully paid-up, they could only surrender  one or both remaining segments in full.
On 11 January 2019, Mr and Mrs F requested a part-surrender of the MIP to the value  of 
£100,000 and were informed 10 days later that this wasnt permitted under the policys 
terms and conditions. As they were on holiday at the time, they couldnt consider alternatives  
and decided to fully surrender the MIP as soon as possible, as they were concerned at the 
downward movement  in prices. 
Ref: DRN99225192Notwithstanding that Mr and Mrs F had been misinformed about their options  in November 
2018, Old Mutual  also accepted that it ought  to have  responded to their initial request within 
three working days, i.e. by 15 January 2019.  It agreed to give Mr and Mrs F the best 
possible value for the MIP between 15 January 2019 and 23 January 2019 when Old Mutual 
received their instructions. The transfer of funds would be made by CHAPS free of charge to 
ensure same  day payment. 
As it was, the surrender  value  of the MIP on 23 January  was almost £3,500 more than on 
15 January 2019.  But, in recognition of the incorrect information Mr and Mrs F were  given  in 
November 2018  and the inconvenience they were  caused in January 2019 when they 
werent allowed  to part surrender the MIP, Old Mutual offered them  £200. Mr and Mrs F 
rejected this offer, suggesting that compensation equivalent to dividend income of three per 
cent on £144,000 would  be appropriate  in the circumstances.   
Mr and Mrs Fs complaint was considered by one of our investigators, who,  on balance,  felt 
that the offer made by Old Mutual was fair and reasonable  because she didnt  believe they 
had suffered a financial  loss, as follows:
it was Mr and Mrs Fs decision  to fully surrender the MIP - the erroneous  information 
didnt force them to do so and it hadnt  caused  them a quantifiable loss;
the complaint  relates to the loss of tax benefits. But, while  the proceeds of the MIP 
were tax-exempt,  the investment funds suffered UK corporation  tax at 20 per cent on 
gains and income made by the funds  which is reflected in their unit price and the 
value of the policy;
their alternative to surrendering the MIP was to drawdown some  of Mr Fs SIPP 
which wasnt tax efficient.  While  its difficult to quantify and compare the relative tax 
effects, its likely that drawing down £100,000 from the SIPP would have been more 
disadvantageous than fully surrendering the MIP;
Mr and Mrs F have  released a tax-free sum of £144,000 they didnt  need.  But they 
could reinvest this sum in collective investment schemes, for example, that dont 
attract life policy taxation on the funds;  
also, they could  mitigate income  tax and capital  gains  tax (CGT) by using their 
annual ISA allowances, CGT allowances and interest/dividend  allowances;
if Mr and Mrs F have  already utilised their ISA allowances for 2018/2019 and 
2019/2020, more than half of the sum they didnt  want  to release from the MIP would 
already be invested in a more tax advantageous environment;
while Mr and Mrs F say they had been  allowed  to partially withdraw funds  from the 
MIP twice after it was made fully paid-up,  these sums were raised by fully 
surrendering policy  segments;   
the delay in processing the surrender of the MIP gave them a greater cash  value by 
more than £3,400. 
In response, Mr and Mrs F disagreed  with the investigators assessment and said that:
by January 2019, they had no option other  than to surrender the MIP because the 
deadline had passed for instructing the SIPP provider. They required £100,000 in 
January 2019  and, until 21 January, they believed this sum could be withdrawn from 
the MIP;
if theyd been  given the correct  information  in November 2018, they could have  
negotiated a different payment arrangement  with the builder across  two tax years. 
This would  have enabled Mr F to access his SIPP in two tranches and reduce the 
overall tax liability;
Ref: DRN99225193they had other funds  earmarked for ISA, so it wasnt appropriate to assume  that the 
unwanted sum of £144,000 could be reinvested tax efficiently  within three years;
while the delay  in processing their surrender instructions gave them a greater value 
of almost £3,500,  this isnt compensation;
approximately £100,000 of the MIP proceeds remains in cash as they are unable to 
find appropriate replacement tax shelters for it. In the meantime, the FTSE World and 
FTSE All Share indices have risen  by 10.26 per cent and 8.82 per cent respectively 
between January and July 2019;
they dont  invest  in equities outside tax shelters and shouldnt be compelled to 
change that strategy by Old Mutuals  error. A relevant indicator would be the 
performance of the Old Mutual  funds within the MIP since they took the surrender 
value.
The investigator responded to say that its still more than likely  the tax Mr F incurred on 
drawing down his SIPP would have exceeded  the tax benefits  provided by the MIP. 
Mr F replied to say that his SIPP was in flexible drawdown and the provider required notice 
of withdrawal to be given by 17th of each month for payment  to be made on 28th of that 
month. So, by 21 January  2019,  when Old Mutual  corrected its error, it wasnt an option to 
utilise his SIPP at that time.
While Old Mutual has given them the greater surrender value at 23 January 2019, this 
doesnt compensate  them  in any way for being outside of a tax shelter and out of the market 
for the last seven  months  going forward.
When taking account of all the considerable inconvenience they have been caused and the 
disruption to their carefully  structured finances, its this loss of tax-sheltered equity exposure 
that is central to their complaint. Even  if the alternative of SIPP drawdowns (over two tax 
years) would have  meant  a greater combined  tax payment, they would  have retained  
£144,000 with full capital  gains tax protection and no further income  tax to pay. While its 
impossible to quantify what this loss might be after several years,  the growth in this fund 
after the first six months alone would have more  than compensated for the tax payment on 
the first SIPP withdrawal.
The investigator wasnt persuaded  that the tax payable  on SIPP withdrawals  of £100,000 
would have been less than the tax exemption  benefit of a fund that had equity exposure and 
was taxed internally.
In response, Mr F explained that tax on a £50,000 withdrawal from his SIPP in tax year 
2018/19 would be £8,360,  whereas the return foregone on an extra  £100,000 held in cash  
over the six months  since January 2019  alone was approximately £10,000  as the majority of 
their fund with Old Mutual were of non-UK exposure  and the FTSE World index return was 
10.26 per cent.  Although this doesnt  include tax applied to life policy funds within  the MIP, 
over several years, and even after factoring-in the tax on the second SIPP  withdrawal in 
2019/2020 of £7,498, its likely they would be disadvantaged in the long term.
The enforced restructuring of their investment portfolio is likely to be very costly  for them  
over the medium and long term.
The investigator concluded by saying that Mr Fs further comments  didnt change  her view. 
The deadline  for Mr Fs SIPP is an administrative timeframe set by the provider to manage 
the requests it receives. She couldnt  see this would have prevented Mr F withdrawing an 
Ref: DRN99225194appropriate amount  from his SIPP  in January 2019,  especially as he could have revised his 
payment arrangements  with the builder.
Thats not to say she didnt discount  that Mr and Mrs F acted on incorrect information  
provided by Old Mutual, the impact  of which could have been  mitigated by reinvesting the 
unwanted balance  of £144,000 in tax-efficient products rather than holding it on deposit.
Mr F was concerned the investigator hadnt  understood his point about the SIPP.  He never  
intended to access  the SIPP after it was confirmed  by Old Mutual in November  2018  that 
they could part-surrender  the MIP when the money was needed in January  2019.
When Old Mutual informed them on 21 January that they could not just withdraw  £100,000, it 
was too late in the month to give notice  to Mr Fs SIPP provider.  So, when the error was 
discovered, they had no option other  than to fully surrender the MIP and release £144,000 
they didnt need which they preferred to remain in the policy.  The SIPP deadline was 
17 January 2019  and they would not have been  able to drawdown at least £50,000  to pay 
their builder.  Mr F could  have negotiated  a revised payment plan in November 2018; but not 
in January 2019.
Mr F added that:
apart from £25,000 they held in premium bonds, the balance of £144,000 sits in no-
notice online savings  accounts;
he used his annual  ISA allowance in late January 2019 when we received  the 
proceeds of the MIP, which he invested  in equity funds. Although  Mrs F didnt add to 
her existing  ISA at the time, they invested £20,000 in each in their respective ISAs for 
tax year 2019/20;
they are currently standard rate taxpayers, and their intention is to remain  so;
their current  aim is to invest the full annual allowances in equity funds of their ISAs in 
successive tax years. But they had earmarked other cash or maturing investments 
(including index-linked savings certificates) for this purpose.  So, it wasnt correct  to 
assume that, in three- or four-years time,  they would recover the tax benefits of the 
MIP though their ISAs;
as a rule, they dont  expose their money to equities outside mainstream tax shelters 
and havent used two-to-five-year fixed rate bonds because the yield doesnt warrant 
the loss of flexibility;
the sum of £100,000 was needed  in January 2019 to settle  their builders costs and, 
at the same time,  to replenish their cash deposits  that had been depleted to make  
earlier stage payments.
As no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been referred to me for review.
findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs F have previously referred complaints to our service  about 
other servicing issues theyve had with Old Mutual.
Ref: DRN99225195But this decision looks to resolve their complaint on its merits about  the information  they 
received from Old Mutual in November 2018  in readiness for withdrawing  funds from their 
MIP in January 2019.
In 2018, Mr and Mrs F held a MIP with two policy segments remaining, valued at 
approximately £100 and £244,000 respectively,  that was due to mature in January 2022. 
They had stopped contributions to it by February 2014 whereupon the policy became fully 
paid-up. As such,  its terms and conditions allowed Mr and Mrs F to surrender one or both 
segments in full, but not to part-surrender either of them.
The MIP suffered no chargeable gain on surrender or when it matured. But the policy  held by 
Mr and Mrs F invested equally  in five medium risk-rated funds whose gains and income are 
subject to UK corporation  tax of 20 per cent. This liability to tax is reflected in the unit price  of 
the funds. 
So, although  the MIP was tax-exempt on surrender, it is taxed internally while  it remained in 
force and would  have  continued to be so until it matured in January 2022. 
In other  words, the tax advantages of the MIP are only realised  when the policy is 
surrendered, or it matures - there  are no tax advantages within the plan until the proceeds 
are taken. So, in fully surrendering the policy in January 2019, Mr and Mrs F havent lost any 
of the policys  tax benefits - they received the proceeds tax-free three  years  earlier  than they 
might have intended. 
To enhance/preserve  the sum of £144,000  they didnt need in January 2019, Mr and Mrs F 
could have considered savings and investment  products that offered greater tax advantages  
within the product  itself than the MIP, such as ISAs (which suffer  no income tax or capital 
gain tax and proceeds are paid tax-free  as well) and collective  investment  schemes  (where,  
as basic rate taxpayers, they will pay capital gains tax of 10 per cent or 20 per cent within 
the funds and can use their annual CGT  exemption  of £12,000  each when realising these 
investments). 
In addition, its possible that the charging  structure  of these  alternative  investments might be 
lower and there would  be no deductions  from the fund to provide life cover necessary for the 
MIP to be qualifying  for tax exemption. 
So, in accordance with how Mr and Mrs F say they manage their investments, the MIP 
wasnt necessarily more  efficient in terms of taxation  of gains. And I cant  see how holding  
this capital sum of £144,000 on deposit  fits their savings strategy.
Notwithstanding this, its not disputed  that, in being told by Old Mutual in November 2018  
that the policy (segments) could be part-surrendered to the value of £100,000,  Mr and Mrs F 
were mis-informed. 
What I must consider is what,  on balance, Mr and Mrs F would have done if they had been 
told that at least one segment must  be surrendered in full if they wanted to withdraw enough 
funds from the MIP to pay their builder. Given their financial need and the respective value of 
each segment, this meant they would  need to surrender  the larger segment for £244,000 or 
consider an alternative  means of raising  £100,000.  
If, as Mr F says,  he could have agreed  a revised  payment plan with his builder in November 
2018 and draw down £100,000 from his SIPP across two tax years, this would have given 
Ref: DRN99225196him an immediate tax liability of £8,360 and £7,498 each time. I can certainly  appreciate why 
Mr and Mrs F would  not have favoured this option  if they could have part-surrendered the 
MIP for £100,000 given  how long it might take for the MIP to recover the tax losses the SIPP  
drawdown would have cost Mr F.  
But, for the same reason,  Im not sure that drawing down Mr Fs SIPP  would have been 
preferable even if Mr and Mrs F had been  told in November 2018 that the MIP needed to be 
surrendered in full to raise £100,000. 
Mr F has also said that they had earmarked other income and assets  to make use of their 
annual ISA allowances.  But its evident that, by January 2019, neither  Mr nor Mrs F had 
invested these  assets in their ISA for tax year 2018/2019.  And, while Mr F hasnt confirmed 
the nature  of these assets or their total value, it seems they werent sufficient to pay their 
builder and replenish their deposit  savings either. Otherwise, I might have expected they 
would have used  these funds for this purpose, rather than disturb the MIP given it offered the 
tax shelter they valued.
 
But, as they didnt consider these assets, or a combination  of these assets  and Mr Fs SIPP,  
Im inclined  to think that, even if they had been told in November 2018 that they needed to 
surrender the MIP in full to raise £100,000, they might still have done  so. As the investigator 
commented, they could have changed  their minds  about surrendering the MIP and used 
other funds  in January 2019  but for the tax implications of drawing  down Mr Fs SIPP  and 
the adequacy of their other assets  to replenish their deposit savings.   
I understand that the sum of £144,000 cant now be reinvested in the MIP as its closed to 
new business. But Mr and Mrs F received this sum free of tax (albeit three years 
prematurely) and could  have invested it in products  that offered greater tax benefits  than the 
MIP without presenting a greater degree of equity  exposure.  
But the loss, if any, Mr and Mrs F may have suffered in fully surrendering the MIP cannot 
easily be quantified. To this end, I dont think its relevant to consider how the FTSE Share 
Indices would have  performed since January 2019  to see when the MIP might overcome 
what was an immediate  tax liability of £15,585  and the loss of future  growth or pension  
income on £100,000 of Mr Fs SIPP.  
Mr and Mrs F relied on incorrect  information from Old Mutual in November 2018  that they 
could part-surrender  the MIP to the value of £100,000. That they were required by the policy 
terms and conditions to fully surrender the MIP in order to do so doesnt persuade me there 
were alternatives available to them of raising a sum of £100,000 that were preferable.  
However, in recognition that they were led to believe they could leave £144,000 in the MIP, 
Old Mutual offered them £200 for the trouble and upset this will have caused them when  
they realised in January 2019  that this couldnt  happen. 
Nonetheless, Mr and Mrs F received  £144,000 tax-free from the MIP they could invest  in 
other products until January 2022  with exposure to the same  degree of risk and which  
provided greater  tax advantages than if this sum had remained in the MIP. In the 
circumstances and given  I cant be sure Mr and Mrs F wouldnt have fully surrendered the 
MIP anyway and suffered  a financial  loss as a result, I think this offer is fair and reasonable.    
Old Mutual also offered  to compensate Mr and Mrs F for the delay in processing the 
surrender request they made on 11 January 2019 by offering them the better  of the MIPs 
Ref: DRN99225197value on 23 January 2019 (when it actioned the request) and on 15 January 2019 (when it 
ought to have actioned the request). 
But, as it was, Mr and Mrs F received  a surrender  value  on 23 January 2019 that was almost 
£3,500 more than the surrender value they would have received on 15 January 2019  and, as 
such, they have  suffered no loss.
         
decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 January  2020.
