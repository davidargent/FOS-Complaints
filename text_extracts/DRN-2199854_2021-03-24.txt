The complaint
 Mr M complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA will not refund some disputed transactions 
on his account.  He also complains it has restricted his access to the account. 
What happened
Mr M says that transactions carried out on his PayPal account between 8th and 14th April 
2020 were not made by him.  He wanted PayPal to refund these.
PayPal refused to do so.  It said the transactions appeared to have been authorised and it 
was also going to restrict access to the account.  The transactions were made to individuals 
which meant they were not eligible for buyer protection.
It suggested Mr M speaks to his bank who had issued the card.
Mr M did speak to his bank and was able to recover just over Â£400.  However, this still left a 
balance which PayPal was holding Mr M liable for.
So, when PayPal rejected his complaint, Mr M came to this service.  Our investigator didnt 
think Mr M had authorised the payments and he asked PayPal to refund them.  It refused  
and the matter was passed to me for a final decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 PayPal say there is no evidence of compromise to Mr Ms account and that it was accessed 
from IP addresses in an area where it had been accessed from before.  In fact, PayPal say 
the account was opened using one of these IP addresses.  This is the evidence it relies upon 
in rejecting Mr Ms complaint.
But I remind myself that it is for PayPal to prove Mr M authorised these transactions and not 
for Mr M to prove he did not.  Specifically, PayPal needs to prove the transactions were 
authenticated as well as proving Mr M consented to the payments.
Im not satisfied from the evidence that Mr M did consent to the payments.  My starting point 
is that he has said he did not, and I have no reason to doubt that.  Furthermore, I dont think 
the evidence of the IP address is conclusive.  
I also note PayPal has been unable to provide evidence of a device used to access Mr Ms 
account.  Mr M says he only ever used his computer  so on balance, I dont think the 
numerous IP addresses are not consistent with that use.
In the circumstances, I dont think PayPal has been able to prove Mr M authorised these 
transactions.  Accordingly, I will be asking that it refunds these, minus the refund Mr M has 
already received from his bank.
In relation to the restrictions placed on Mr Ms account, that is a matter for PayPal and not a 
decision this service would interfere with unless it could be shown it was unfair on Mr M.  I 
have seen nothing to suggest it was.
Putting things right
 PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund the disputed transactions, minus the amount 
already recovered from Mr Ms bank.  Mr M needs to confirm the exact amount with PayPal. 
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2021.
