DRN-3679527
The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted and then closed 
his account without any notice being given.
What happened
Mr R was overseas and noticed he couldnt use his NatWest account. Mr R contacted 
NatWest and was told the decision had been made by NatWest to no longer provide 
services to him which meant that his accounts were immediately restricted until the process 
to close them could be completed. Mr R wasnt happy about this, so he approached this 
service to make a complaint.
This service referred Mr Rs complaint to NatWest, who issued a response which confirmed 
that the decision had been made to no longer offer services to Mr R. NatWest also confirmed 
they werent willing or obliged to provide any further information as to why theyd made their 
decision, and that they didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Mr R wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he asked our service to consider his 
complaint. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that 
NatWest had acted unfairly towards Mr R in how theyd managed the situation, and so they 
also didnt uphold the complaint. Mr R remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been upsetting for Mr R to have learned that NatWest had 
made the decision to no longer provide services to him, which had led to the immediate 
restriction of his account pending NatWests closure of it.
Having reviewed the terms and conditions of the NatWest account, Im satisfied that those 
terms do allow NatWest to restrict and then close an account in the manner that they did 
here in certain circumstances. And so, Ive asked NatWest to provide a more detailed 
explanation as to why they made the decision to stop providing services to Mr R as they did.
Im not at liberty to share the more detailed information provided to this service by NatWest 
with Mr R, but having reviewing it Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NatWest to make 
the decision to no longer provide services to Mr R which led to the restriction and 
subsequent closure of his account. And Im similarly satisfied that NatWest were acting 
within the terms of the account by doing so.
I realise this explanation may not be of much satisfaction to Mr R, and that he would like to 
better understand himself why his account was closed. But NatWest arent obliged to provide 
such further information to Mr R as he would like here, and so I hope that Mr R can find 
some comfort in knowing that the legitimacy of NatWests rationale has been checked by 
someone impartial.
NatWest have acknowledged that one of the conditions of their being able to close a 
customers account is that they provide a 60-day notice letter to that customer, and that 
when they first made the decision to stop providing services to Mr R that such a letter wasnt 
sent. NatWest recognised this fact before they closed Mr Rs account and sent a 60-day 
closure notice letter to him at that time. And NatWest didnt officially close the account until 
that 60-day given term had expired. 
Im thought about NatWests oversight in not sending Mr R the notice letter in the first 
instance. And having done so, I dont feel that there was any tangible adverse effect on Mr R 
by it not being sent. This is because Mr R was overseas when the letter was sent, and so 
wasnt at his UK address to have received it. Additionally, the letter also explained that Mr 
Rs account was being restricted pending closure with immediate effect, which is what took 
place. 
As such, I feel that the practical outcome experienced by Mr R here  that he noticed while 
overseas that he could no longer use his account  would have been experienced by him 
regardless of whether the 60-day notice letter had been correctly sent by NatWest t Mr Rs 
UK address in the first instance or not.
Ultimately, while I can appreciate the difficult position that NatWest restricting and then 
closing his account had on Mr R, Im satisfied that it was both reasonable and permitted for 
NatWest to take the decision to stop offering services to Mr R that they did. Consequently, I 
dont feel that NatWest acted unfairly towards Mr R by restricting and then closing his 
account.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr R was wanting, but it follows from the above that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I hope 
that Mr R will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I 
have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2022.
