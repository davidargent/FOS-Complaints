The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as G, is unhappy with the service it received from 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding attempts it made to contact 
NatWest about arrears that had accrued on one of its loans.
Gs complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr S.
What happened
G has a business bank account and two loan accounts with NatWest. The two loans are a 
Small Business Loan (SBL) and a Bounce Back Loan (BBL).
G missed several payments towards its SBL such that in January 2023, NatWest made the 
decision to begin default proceedings and issued a formal demand to G for full repayment of 
the SBL. Mr S wasnt happy about this as hed tried to contact NatWest about the SBL 
arrears but had either been unable to get through or had found that the NatWest staff he had 
spoken with had been unable to help him. And he also wasnt happy that NatWest hadnt 
contacted him themselves. So, he raised a complaint on Gs behalf.
NatWest responded to Mr S and explained that they felt theyd followed an appropriate 
account arrears process and so wouldnt be upholding that aspect of his complaint. 
However, NatWest did accept Mr Ss testimony that he had been cut off when he had tried to 
contact their Specialist Business Management (SBM) team, to which Gs accounts had 
been referred, and they sent Mr S a hamper as a token of their apology. Mr S wasnt 
satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred Gs complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, including that Gs accounts had been moved to 
NatWests SBM team. And our investigator also felt that Mr S had been fairly informed by 
NatWest that if Gs SBL couldnt be repaid in full, as NatWest now required, that NatWest 
may consider ending their business relationship with G  which would mean the default or 
closure of all of Gs accounts  Mr S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. Instead, this service is an informal, impartial 
dispute resolution service. And while we do take relevant law and regulation into account 
when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed on determining whether we feel a fair or 
unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial perspective, after taking all the factors and 
circumstances of a complaint into consideration.
One consequence of this is that it isnt for this service to instruct a business such as 
NatWest to change or amend its operational policies and processes. Rather, its for a 
business to decide how it operates. Instead, the role to this service is to decide whether the 
specific actions of a business being complained about can reasonably be said to have led to 
an unfair outcome or not.
In this instance, NatWest issued a formal demand for full repayment of Gs SBL because G 
had failed to adhere to its contractual repayment obligations, as per the loan agreement. 
This doesnt seem unfair or unreasonable to me, and I note that a failure to meet the 
contractual payment obligations is an act of default as per the SBL agreement. And having 
reviewed NatWests actions leading up to the issuance of the formal demand, Im satisfied 
that they sent fair notice to G of the arrears that had accrued on its SBL and warned G of the 
potential consequences if those SBL arrears werent addressed.
Additionally, its the responsibility of Mr S, as the director of G, to have monitored the status 
of Gs accounts with NatWest and to have been aware of the payment arrears that 
developed on the SBL. Similarly, it was also Mr Ss responsibility, given that G was the SBL 
account holder, to have contacted NatWest to arrange the resolution of those arrears  
either proactively or in response to NatWests requests for him to do so.
Mr S complains that he did attempt to call NatWest, but that he was either cut off or that the 
NatWest agents he spoke with were unable to help him. NatWests own records dont 
corroborate Mr Ss position in this regard, although NatWest did accept that Mr S may have 
been cut off in their response to Gs complaint and apologised to Mr S for this.
However, it was Gs responsibility to have made the repayments that were contractually 
required of it as per the SBL agreement. And if Mr S was unable to contact NatWest by 
telephone there were other options available to him, such as making an arrears repayment 
proposal by written letter or by email. But Ive seen no evidence of this, and Mr S hasnt 
referred to any alternative proposal attempts in his correspondence with this service. 
Additionally, theres also no indication that Mr S tried to make any full or partial arrears 
repayment, which would have indicated a willingness on his behalf to have resolved the 
issue of the outstanding SBL arrears with NatWest.
So, while Mr S may have struggled to contact NatWest by phone about the arrears, Im not 
convinced that he reasonably did enough to try to contact NatWest via other channels to find 
a resolution to the SBL arrears with them. And while I appreciate that trying to contact 
NatWest via other channels may have been inconvenient for Mr S, I feel that it was 
incumbent on Mr S to have accepted this inconvenience, given that it was G that had broken 
the loan agreement by not making the payments that were contractually required of it.
I also note from NatWests contact notes that there were instances where Mr S spoke with 
NatWest about the SBL arrears. For instance, in November 2022, Mr S discussed the 
arrears with NatWest and agreed to call them back. But NatWest didnt receive a call back 
from Mr S. And, as explained previously, I feel it was incumbent on Mr S to have contacted 
NatWest, regardless of any difficulty he may have experienced when trying to do so.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or acted unfairly 
by following the process that they have done, including issuing a formal demand to G which 
required full repayment of the SBL balance.
NatWest have also confirmed that if G is unable to meet its requirement to repay the full 
outstanding balance of the SBL, it may move Gs accounts from its SBM team to its 
recoveries team. NatWest confirm that this would effectively end the business relationship between G and NatWest and lead to the default or closure of all of Gs accounts. This would 
be a commercial decision for NatWest to make, and so I can only encourage Mr S to work 
with NatWest, as per their requirements, should he wish to avoid this potential outcome.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr S was wanting, but it follows that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further or alternative action. I hope Mr S will 
understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2023.
