K821x#15complaint
Mr B says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN),  trading  as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket, lent 
to him irresponsibly.
background
This complaint is about 36 payday  loans  and three  instalment loans CEN provided to Mr B 
between May 2008 and April 2014.
In its final response to Mr Bs complaint, CEN accepted there was a pattern of dependency 
apparent in Mr Bs lending  history and upheld his complaint in respect  of loans 26-29 and 
loans 33-38.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended  CEN put things right for a 
number of other loans.  For ease  of reference,  Ive attached her table as an appendix to this 
decision. Our adjudicator didnt think CEN shouldve provided loans 8-39. CEN didnt accept 
the adjudicators  view.  And neither did Mr B, who thought the earlier  loans should also have 
been upheld.
As no agreement was reached, the complaint  was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Bs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and have explained why below.
CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay his loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Bs income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN75643902Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Bs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did CEN,  each  time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mr B would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those 
checks have shown  that Mr B would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did CEN  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Bs complaint.
Did CEN,  each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Mr B would be able to repay  in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr B would  have been  able to do so?
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint about loans 1-7 be upheld. And looking at 
the amounts borrowed and all the other  factors, I dont think Ive enough  evidence  to say 
these loans were provided  irresponsibly.
Ive mentioned above some of the indicators  that might mean a lender shouldve done  more 
to check whether a loan was affordable. And I note that Mr B did take five consecutive loans 
in five months between  May and September 2008.  But the amounts he borrowed  remained 
broadly flat. And I dont think the repayments  were so large that its obvious they wouldve 
caused Mr B financial difficulty; nor is five months is such a long time that the length of the 
chain of borrowing  alone indicated Mr B was struggling to settle his loans sustainably. Ive 
also not noted any significant  repayments  difficulties during  this period.
After the first five loans  there was a break  of about a year until loan 6. Mr B has said that he 
borrowed from another lender regularly during this period. While I dont doubt what he says,  
I havent seen  enough evidence to allow me to determine whether, or to what  extent, CEN 
was aware of this when  Mr B asked for loan 6. And given the time thats passed, I dont think 
I can really say what Mr Bs credit history  wouldve looked  like (bearing in mind that this 
information is generally removed after six years) at the time.
So I think its reasonable that the year-long break  be looked at as a substantial  break  and 
that loan 6 represents the start of a new chain of lending. With that in mind  I dont think that 
loans 6 or 7 wouldve appeared to be unaffordable to CEN,  much for the same reasons Ive 
given for loans 1-5.
Ive not seen clear  details  of what CEN  checked  before approving  loans 8-11. But when Mr B 
applied for loan 8, he asked  to borrow much more than he had previously. Loan 8 had a 
repayment of £480   which was almost 50% of Mr Bs income. Given this, I think  
proportionate checks wouldve  including considering  proof  of Mr Bs income  and expenditure 
(such proof could include obtaining bank  statements).
CEN didnt  carry out proportionate checks like this. But even  so, I think CEN ought  to have 
realised £480  was a very significant  proportion or Mr Bs income,  such  that he wouldnt likely 
Ref: DRN75643903have been able to pay it without the need to borrow again. So I dont think  CEN shouldve  
approved this loan.
Loans 9-11 were  smaller than loan 8 but Mr B was clearly borrowing one loan very soon 
after repaying another with no gaps longer than 14 days  less than one pay cycle.  So CEN 
shouldve realised it was likely Mr B was left with a shortfall each month  and so was in a 
cycle of needing to repeatedly borrow. Had CEN also carried out proportionate checks,  
I dont think its likely  loans 9-11 wouldve looked  affordable. And so CEN shouldnt  have 
approved them.
So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  loans 8 to 11 because I dont think  that CEN carried 
out reasonable and proportionate checks and such checks wouldve more  likely than not 
shown CEN  that Mr B couldnt sustainably repay these loans.
I havent considered  whether proportionate affordability checks wouldve shown loans 12 to 
39 to be individually  affordable because I dont  think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain 
why this is the case in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which CEN should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so CEN  should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point was 
reached by loan 12. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr B was borrowing were often increasing (and only occasionally  
decreased) and CEN ought to have realised it was likely his indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably
from loans 13 the gaps between the loans were very often  minimal  or non-existent  
and at times Mr Bs QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket loans  appear  to overlap. There  
were some larger  gaps towards the end of the second chain of lending, but they dont 
appear until several years have  passed. So I think its clear Mr B was struggling  to 
settle his loans sustainably throughout this period
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CEN. And he was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period. 
Overall, the second chain of lending (starting in October 2009) lasted for about four 
and a half years  which doesnt  reflect the intended use of high-cost short-term  
credit
I think that Mr B lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from loan 12 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans,  deferrals  and repayment plans) was likely  to have 
had negative implications on Mr Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans
Ref: DRN75643904So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  loans 12 to 39 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did CEN  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude CEN  acted  unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr B in some other 
way. 
I should say that I know Mr B isnt entirely happy his Pounds to Pocket and QuickQuid 
complaints were combined,  particularly as CEN had raised concerns about time limits which 
affected some but not all of his loans. He feels combining things, coupled with CENs 
objections caused  delays.
I understand Mr Bs frustrations and I acknowledge hes been waiting a long time for an 
answer. But I cant say CEN  acted  unfairly towards  him purely because it had some 
concerns about  time limits. I should  also add that although  it operates  a number of brands, 
CEN is a single legal entity. So it usually makes sense for us to merge complaints about  
multiple products  into one case  particularly where  there are overlapping loans, as there are 
here.
other matters
CEN has also said it feels this service shouldve put its latest offer to Mr B. The offer was 
essentially the same as the offer Mr B had already rejected, albeit it CEN  was now offering 
to add 8% simple interest  to the refund  in its final response letter.  CEN  provided no real 
explanation why it thought  its offer was fair  and it was very different to the outcome 
proposed by the adjudicator. And Mr B had also said he felt the adjudicators proposals 
didnt go far enough.  He thought more  loans shouldve been upheld.  With that in mind, 
I dont think it was necessary to put CENs offer to Mr B.
In response to the adjudication, CEN made  a number of points about  the current  regulators 
(the FCA) consumers credit sourcebook (CONC).  Specifically it said CONC 5 didnt  support  
that an unsustainable pattern of lending could be established and that each loan needed to 
be looked at individually.
Neither I, nor the adjudicator, have  said that CONC 5 means an unsustainable pattern of 
lending can be established. Not least because CONC is barely  relevant to Mr Bs complaint.  
CONC came  into force  with FCA regulation on 1 April 2014.  So its only (just) relevant to the 
very last in the second chain  loan 39.
CENs said, in response to our adjudicator, it doesnt  accept that, the number of instances 
of lending, in and of itself,  is evidence  that a borrower is reliant on High-Cost Short Term  
credit
I dont agree with this statement  although Id add that in Mr Bs case, the number  of loans 
isnt the only factor Ive taken into account. The above statement is also at odds with CENs 
final response letter. CEN upheld the complaint about ten of Mr Bs loans because,  a 
pattern of dependency  emerged with [loan 26] and such  pattern continued after the period 
[Mr B] took out the above referenced loan.
Ref: DRN75643905Given that CEN will be aware of this services approach to repeat  lending from many 
previous decisions  (as well as whats set out on our website), I wont say anything more  on 
this point.
putting things right  what CEN needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loan 8 and all subsequent  loans;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
Its not likely  many of these loans will still appear  on Mr Bs credit history.  But for those that 
do::
CEN should remove any negative information about loans 8-11 from Mr B credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 12 means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loan 12 and subsequent loans should be removed 
from Mr Bs credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  CEN  to take off tax from this interest.  CEN  must  give Mr B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold the complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2019.
