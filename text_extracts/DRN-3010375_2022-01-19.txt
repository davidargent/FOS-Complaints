The complaint
Miss W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) charged a transaction to 
a secondary card on her account. This led to her account with a retailer being closed. 
What happened
Miss W has a PayPal account and used this regularly to purchase items from a retailer  
who Ill refer to as company A. On one occasion, Miss W added her fathers debit card 
details to her PayPal account to make a purchase. Miss W says this was an isolated event 
and she didnt intend to use this debit card again. Then, on a later transaction in which Miss 
W bought an item from company A, Miss Ws fathers debit card was used again and this led 
to her fathers bank flagging this payment as fraudulent. Miss W says this led to her account 
with company A being blocked. Miss W says, while this was happening, she attempted to 
make multiple returns to company A and sought refunds through PayPal by registering a 
claim. But, the majority of the claims were declined and she was left in a position where she 
had returned the items to company A but was without a refund.    
PayPal explained Miss W filed 17 claims over three days. PayPal explained the majority of 
these claims were declined on the basis Miss W didnt provide a valid Significantly Not As 
Described (SNAD) reason. PayPal said their User Agreement sets out the funding sources 
and also the order in which they will be used. PayPal explained, as Miss W had previously 
used her fathers card to make a purchase and didnt then take steps to remove the card 
from her account, it remained there as a funding source. PayPal explained its a customers 
responsibility to add or remove funding sources available on their account.    
Miss W accepts her fathers card was added to her PayPal account in order to purchase an 
item he wanted. The card was still attached to Miss Ws account but she says it hadnt been 
used for some time. Miss W made several orders and thought everything had gone through. 
Miss W then tried to log into her account with company A but found she had been blocked. 
An email followed which said that there was a suspicion of fraud so her account had been 
blocked. Miss W then contacted PayPal and it came to light that an item she had purchased 
was paid for using her fathers card. Miss Ws fathers bank flagged the transactions as 
fraud. Miss W says her father explained the position to his bank and they then unblocked his 
card. Miss W says she returned all of the items to company A. 
Our investigator looked into things for Miss W. He thought PayPal hadnt made any payment 
error or acted unfairly in deciding the claims against Miss W. Miss W disagreed so the matter 
has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Miss W will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
Theres no dispute here that Miss W had used her fathers debit card for a transaction in the 
past. I cant see Miss W has then taken steps to remove this card from her PayPal account 
and it appears this debit card was then used again for a transaction and this led to company 
A blocking her account. So, the first point Ive looked at here is how Miss Ws fathers card 
came to be used again.   
  
The PayPal User Agreement sets out how payments are funded. This says PayPal will take 
payment from a customers account in a specific order to the extent that such options are 
available. It then sets out a list of the options which are available to a customer. The list 
includes bank account and further down the list theres the option of debit card. The User 
Agreement goes on further to say By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you 
give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source And You can 
stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account. 
PayPal say, when a transaction is being processed the option of a funding source is chosen 
by the customer whether that be bank or card. If it was a case that there was an issue with a 
funding source chosen, the system can default to a backup funding source which is any card 
on file. PayPal say they have reviewed their system and there is no evidence that any errors 
have occurred with these transactions.
PayPal have provided screenshots from their system which show most of the transactions 
being disputed by Miss W were funded by her bank account as this was the option selected. 
Theres one transaction which was funded by her fathers debit card. This is what has 
caused Miss Ws account with company A to be blocked. I cant however say PayPal have 
made an error here. The information shows Miss Ws bank account wasnt a funding option 
for this transaction so, in line with the order of funding sources set out in the User 
Agreement, this wouldve defaulted to the next available funding source  which in this case 
appears to be Miss Ws fathers debit card. As this hadnt been unlinked, the payment was 
taken from this funding source. 
I note Miss W feels this was down to a technical error during the process, but I havent seen 
any evidence to suggest a system or technical error caused this. I also think its very unlikely 
down to a technical error as the specific event which has occurred here is something which 
the system allows. So, I dont think there has been an error by PayPal in the way the 
transaction involving Miss Ws fathers debit card was processed. Ive then looked at Miss 
Ws claims and whether PayPal have acted reasonably.  
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
claim. 
I can see Paypal have a PayPal Buyer Protection policy which allows a buyer to seek 
reimbursement for the full purchase price of an item. The policy says PayPal determines 
whether a claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. The policy goes further to say the 
buyer protection may apply when a buyer encounters specific problems with a transaction, 
this being either the buyer not receiving the item from a seller or receiving an item but it not 
being what they ordered  this is referred to as SNAD. And, the policy says a buyer may be 
required to return the item to the seller as part of the settlement of the claim.  
The claims have all been made using SNAD as the reason. The claims which have been 
declined by PayPal have been based on the claims not meeting the requirements for SNAD. 
Ive looked at the reasoning given by Miss W to support her claim and this doesnt say the 
basis of the return is because the item is materially different from the sellers description, is a completely different item or damaged. The reasoning given for a number of the claims is that 
the claim relates to company A blocking Miss Ws account but this doesnt fall within the 
criteria for a SNAD claim. Theres two claims which have been closed as Miss W didnt 
respond to PayPals request for additional information. I can see two claims were refunded 
but this was at the sellers request rather than Miss Ws SNAD claim being found in her 
favour. 
I acknowledge Miss Ws comment about this being an unusual scenario and one which 
doesnt fit into the specific claims she can make to PayPal. The closest match is SNAD so 
this is why the claims were registered under this option. The information shows PayPal have 
acted in line with the User Agreement and their policy by investigating Miss Ws claims but 
she hasnt provided a valid SNAD reason. So, I cant say PayPal have acted unreasonably in 
declining the claims. 
I note Miss W has provided information which shows she has returned the items to company 
A. But, I cant see the User Agreement sets out a requirement for PayPal to refund the 
payment if a buyer returns the item. The refund depends on the claim being found in a 
buyers favour. Im sorry to hear Miss W has been left in a position where she no longer has 
the items and also no refund. But, PayPal arent obliged to provide a refund unless the claim 
has been found in Miss Ws favour or, as has happened in two of the claims, the transaction 
has been refunded at company As request. I cant see this has happened for the declined 
claims. I note Miss W says company A have told her they have provided a full refund to 
PayPal, but I cant say the evidence supports this. Its clear there were two claims which led 
to a refund but this was refunded on company As request. PayPal say this means company 
A refunded these and not PayPal. So, for the declined claims, it appears a similar approach 
will be required. So, Miss W will need to ask company A to refund the transactions. 
Miss W does have my sympathy for the position she now finds herself in. I can see this has 
had a significant impact on her work, reputation and relationship with company A. My role is 
to look into the complaint against PayPal to decide whether they have acted fairly and 
reasonably. And, for the reasons I have explained, I cant say they have made an error and I 
think they acted fairly in handling Miss Ws claims. Miss W says she has followed company 
As returns policy so I think it might be appropriate here for her to raise a complaint directly 
with them as they have received the items but not arranged a refund. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February 2022.
