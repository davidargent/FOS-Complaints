K821x#15complaint
Mrs W complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mrs W was given three loans by QuickQuid between July and October 2016. She took some  
additional borrowing  on two of the loans  shortly after the initial advance. Each  of the loans 
was repayable over two or three months.  Although  Mrs W needed to defer the repayment of 
her final loan for around two months by paying some  additional interest, all of the loans have 
been fully repaid. A summary of Mrs Ws borrowing  from QuickQuid is as follows;
Loan

1 06/07/2016 25/07/2016 £    400
2 09/08/2016 23/09/2016 £    300
3 07/10/2016 30/01/2017 £    350
Mrs Ws complaint  has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think QuickQuid 
had been wrong  to give the first two loans to Mrs W. But he thought that the information  
QuickQuid had gathered should have shown that the third loan was unlikely to be 
sustainably affordable for Mrs W. So he asked QuickQuid to pay Mrs W some  
compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mrs W accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mrs W could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN67223812the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mrs W could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ws complaint.
Before lending to Mrs W, QuickQuid asked  her for details of her income,  and her normal  
monthly expenditure. It then used this information, together with data it gathered  from other 
sources such as her credit  file, to calculate what  it termed her estimated  disposable income 
(EDI). This was the amount that QuickQuid thought Mrs W could afford to spend each 
month repaying her borrowing.
Based on what Mrs W had said about her expenditure, and the EDI that QuickQuid had 
calculated, I think the repayments she needed to make on the first two loans would have 
appeared affordable. So given what was apparent about Mrs Ws circumstances at the time, 
and her history with the lender,  I dont think it wouldve been proportionate  for QuickQuid to 
ask her for the amount  of information  that might be needed to show the lending  was 
unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mrs W provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
she was saying.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give the first two loans to Mrs W.
Shortly after repaying her second loan, Mrs W asked to borrow again. But the EDI that 
QuickQuid calculated at that time was much lower  than before meaning that the lender 
thought Mrs W had much less money left over each  month that she could use to repay her 
lending.
Ref: DRN67223813When she first took the third loan Mrs W agreed to repay it in two instalments. By far the 
largest instalment  was due seven weeks later. So QuickQuid says Mrs W could save some  
disposable income at the start of that period to put towards her final repayment. So it is 
effectively saying that I should consider the average repayment Mrs W needed to make  each 
month on her loan.
But I dont agree that was reasonable here.  By then Mrs W had been  borrowing regularly from 
QuickQuid for some  time.  I dont think that should have given QuickQuid any confidence that 
Mrs W was in a position  to save money each month  or indeed  that what shed said about  
her disposable  income  was likely  to be entirely accurate.
And I think that situation became even  clearer when Mrs W asked to top up her borrowing a 
couple of weeks  later. By that time she was left with just five weeks before she needed to 
make the final repayment. And that final repayment was well in excess of the EDI that 
QuickQuid had calculated.
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude that the third loan, or the 
subsequent top up, was sustainably affordable for Mrs W. It follows  that I dont think  
QuickQuid should  have given her this loan and so it needs to put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mrs W on 7 October 2016 (loan 3) or 
to give her the subsequent top up to that loan. So QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loan and top up. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mrs Ws credit file in relation to that loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mrs Ws complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 July 2019.
