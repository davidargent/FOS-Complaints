The complaint
Miss D complains about a chargeback claim on her account with Barclays Bank UK PLC 
(Barclays).
What happened
On 16 May 2022, Miss D bought some tickets for flights. Three amounts of £483.61, 
£379.80, and £446.05 were debited to her account. On the same day, £379.80 and £446.05 
were refunded to her account.
Miss D said the amount of £483.61 was not used for the purchase of a ticket and she had to 
buy another one at a higher price. She lodged a chargeback claim with Barclays for a refund.
On 16 August 2022, Barclays placed a temporary credit to Miss Ds account (£483.16) while 
the claim was investigated. On 13 September 2022, Barclays wrote to Miss D with the 
chargeback findings. Barclays wrote to Miss D on 2 December 2022 to say they couldnt 
recover the disputed amount.
On 16 December 2022, Barclays debited Miss Ds account with £483.16  this caused an 
overdraft of £446 debit.
Miss D complained. She said Barclays hadnt processed the claim properly and she was 
owed the money by the merchant  as the flight ticket hadnt been used by her. And she said 
that when Barclays debited her account with the amount in December, this caused an 
overdraft, which wasnt fair.
Barclays said theyd opened a chargeback claim to try to get the money back and written to 
Miss D to ask her to comment on the evidence and findings - but hadnt had a response. So 
 the claim was not successful and the case was closed. Miss Ds account was debited with 
the amount.
Miss D brought her complaint to us. Our investigator looked into what had happened. She 
said Barclays had written to Miss D on 13 September 2022 with the evidence provided by 
the merchant. The letter asked for any comments that Miss D wanted to make, but she 
hadnt replied. So  the case was closed.
Miss D asked that an ombudsman looks at her complaint, and so it has come to me to make 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The merchant chargeback scheme is a voluntary one  it doesnt mean that customers get 
an automatic refund by putting in a claim. Having listened to the calls to Barclays made by 
Miss D, I think she thought the refund would be made automatically  but thats not the case.
When a customer makes a claim, banks (including Barclays) try to obtain a refund from the 
merchant (the travel company in this case), and they also must follow the scheme rules (i.e. 
Visa or Mastercard). Each case is judged on its merits and evidence  and as Ive said, 
theres no automatic refund.
Miss D made a claim in August 2022  and Barclays then investigated it, getting evidence 
from the merchant. When that happens, Barclays placed a temporary credit of £483.16 to 
Miss Ds account on 16 August 2022. The money would have to be taken back if the claim 
wasnt successful.
I can see that Barclays wrote to Miss D on 13 September 2022 with the merchants findings 
and evidence. The letter asked for a response from Miss D within ten days, but she didnt 
reply or call Barclays. Its part of the chargeback process that if a customer doesnt respond, 
then the case is closed and the account re-debited. So here  thats what happened. The 
case was closed and the claim failed. And then Barclays debited Miss Ds account with 
£483.16 on 16 December 2022. So  Barclays followed the correct process.
Miss D has said she didnt get the letter. But I listened to a call between Barclays and Miss D 
 when she said she was moving to a temporary address due to an injury to her hand. And 
on the call, Barclays call handler changed her address in their records to the address Miss 
D told him  and I can see that was the address that Barclays wrote to on 2 September 
2022, 13 September 2022, 2 December 2022, and 16 December 2022. Barclays have also 
shown us that Miss D logged into internet banking frequently during September 2022, 
October 2022, November 2022, and December 2022  so she couldve seen the letters that 
way as well.
So  Im persuaded that Miss D had the opportunity to see the letters and reply to Barclays if 
she wished to do so.
Therefore, in summary, having looked at Miss Ds complaint, Im satisfied that Barclays dealt 
with her claim reasonably and Im not asking them to do anything here. (continued)
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October 2023.
