K820x#14Complaint
Mr F complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked his account and he cannot 
access his funds. Mr F is unhappy with the service NatWest have provided. He believes that 
NatWest are discriminating against him and he has been left without money  to buy food and 
essential items for his family. Mr F would like access to his funds.
Background
Mr F holds  three accounts with NatWest.
On 30 March 2019 Mr F was concerned that he was unable to access one of his accounts.  
He contacted the bank.
NatWest said that they were carrying out a review  of his accounts  and he wouldnt receive 
any further information from NatWest about his accounts.
Mr F was unhappy with NatWests response  and tried to contact them daily to find out the 
reason why he couldnt get access to any of his three accounts. He was concerned  that he 
couldnt pay his bills or get food for his family.  Despite making  many  calls to NatWest  and 
visiting the branch,  NatWest didnt give him any further information.
Mr F complained to our service. Our investigator  reviewed the complaint and said that 
NatWest were entitled to review Mr Fs account  under  their terms and conditions. She 
acknowledged that Mr F had a difficult time because he didnt have access to any funds,  and 
so he had no money to buy food for his children. She also accepted  that Mr F had been  very 
stressed by the whole situation and had had to go to hospital a number  of times as a result.  
But despite  this NatWest had done  nothing wrong and she didnt uphold  the complaint.
Mr F said he thought the bank had blocked his account  because  of a sale of a bike on eBay. 
Mr F was unhappy with the investigators view he thought the bank must have made an error 
in blocking his account and he was very upset at not being able to access  his money with 
terrible consequences for his family and his health. Mr F was unhappy with the customer  
service he received from NatWest specifically  that no one would tell him why he couldnt 
access his money. He also believed that NatWest was treating him this way because  of his 
disability. Mr F said that the review  had been carried out earlier and the account was not still 
being reviewed  but was frozen. Mr F still believed that NatWest stopped access to his 
money without a reason and without authority to do so.
Following the investigators view Mr F provided  us with correspondence  hed received from 
the bank including a letter dated 23 January  and one dated 1 February 2019 requesting he 
contact NatWest to provide further  information  following a review of their records. 
As there was no agreement the matter has come  to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  having done so I have reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons.
Ref: DRN40452912Ill start by setting out some context for the review  of Mr Fs account.  UK legislation  places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses.  Financial institutions  must establish 
the purpose and intended  nature  of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override  all other obligations.
Mr F says he has no idea why NatWest blocked his accounts and it came as a complete 
shock to him. He says the blocks meant  he couldnt  buy food for his family  or pay bills; direct 
debits were unpaid,  and he incurred charges, and he became so stressed that he had to go 
to hospital four times.  
Whilst I understand Mr Fs strength of feeling, as Ive already explained businesses have a 
legal obligation  to comply with various  laws and regulations. Having looked at the 
information NatWest  relied upon,  Im satisfied that NatWest were  complying with its legal 
and regulatory  obligations when it blocked Mr Fs accounts. So, I cant  say it has done 
anything wrong. The terms  and conditions of Mr Fs account also permit NatWest to block  an 
account. Having  considered those  terms, Im satisfied NatWest  acted in line with them.  
I know Mr F wants NatWest to explain the reason it blocked his accounts. And I can 
understand Mr Fs frustration that he hasnt been  provided an explanation.  But as the 
investigator has explained, NatWest is under no obligation to provide this information to him, 
as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say NatWest has done  anything wrong by not 
providing this information  to him. 
As Ive said NatWest dont have  to give a reason for blocking his account. I understand that 
not being given an answer may have  looked  to Mr F like bad customer  service, but NatWest 
are under no obligation to provide this information to him. 
Mr F has said that he thinks the reason he wasnt given information by NatWest staff was 
because of his disability and he thinks that he has been discriminated against. While I 
appreciate this is his perspective, it is not my role to decide whether discrimination has taken 
place as a matter of law  only the courts have the power to decide  this.
I have, however, considered the relevant law in relation to what  Mr F has said when deciding  
what I think is the fair and reasonable outcome. Part of this has meant considering the 
provisions of The Equality  Act 2010.  But after doing  so Ive not seen evidence to indicate Mr F 
was discriminated on the grounds of his disability, so I havent found that NatWests  behaviour  
was improper.
Ive already said that NatWest has procedures it must follow to comply with its legal and 
regulatory obligations. Im satisfied that is what it was doing  when it blocked Mr Fs accounts. 
So, I dont think it has done  anything wrong.
In summary,  I recognise Mr F feels frustrated and unhappy about  the blocking of his 
accounts and that NatWest wasnt  justified  in blocking his accounts  and denying him access  
to his money. I realise Mr F will be disappointed  by my decision, but overall, based on the 
evidence Ive seen,  I cant say NatWest has acted unreasonably  and treated Mr F unfairly 
when it blocked  his accounts. 
My final decision
For the reasons  I have  given above I do not uphold the complaint.
Ref: DRN40452913Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 June 2020.
