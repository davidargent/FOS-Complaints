Nextcredit accepted  that it shouldnt have agreed loans 3 and 4, because  Mrs B hadnt 
finished repaying loan 2 when those loans were arranged.
Our adjudicator also upheld Mrs Bs complaint about loans 5 and 6. Nextcredit disagreed
and the complaint was passed  to me.
I issued a provisional decision on the complaint on 29 July 2019.  Ive summarised my 
provisional findings below:
I didnt think it was unreasonable  for Nextcredit to have  arranged  loans 1 and 2. 
This was because the loans were arranged during  the early  part of the lending  
relationship, and were  for relatively  low amounts. From what Id seen, there  was 
nothing that Nextcredit shouldve been  aware of that couldve suggested it wasnt  
appropriate for it to arrange the loans.
I accepted that loan 2 was repaid  much  later than had originally been agreed.  But it 
was a late fee that Mrs B incurred that caused the delay, rather than repayment of the 
capital and interest. From the limited available evidence, I didnt think the late settlement 
of loan 2 automatically  suggested  Mrs B was facing  difficulties  in managing  her 
money. 
Loan 5 was arranged more than three  months after loan 4 had been  repaid. So I 
wasnt persuaded that when  loan 5 was taken,  a persistent pattern of borrowing had 
been established which pointed clearly to Mrs B not being  able to repay  her loans in a 
sustainable way. That meant I didnt think it was unreasonable  for Nextcredit to 
arrange loan 5 for Mrs B.
Ref: DRN00142962But I thought that by loan 6, Nextcredit shouldve realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. This was because loan 6 was provided only a few days 
after Mrs B had repaid  loan 5. And it was for double the amount shed borrowed for 
loan 5. 
By the time she took loan 6, Mrs B had been  borrowing from Nextcredit  for a 
considerable period of time.  This was her sixth loan in just over seven months.  So I 
considered Nextcredit ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs B was 
having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances and that Mrs Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I thought that Mrs B lost out as a result  of loan 6 provided by Nextcredit.  This loan 
had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mrs Bs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period of time.
Mrs B didnt make any further  representations  in response to my provisional decision.
Nextcredit responded to say, in summary, that loans 5 and 6 were  the start of a new chain 
of borrowing. Loan 5 was taken out on 21 December and repaid on 27 December. Loan 6 
was taken out on 2 January. Nextcredit  considered  it likely that Mrs B took loan 5 to cover  
her Christmas expenses, and needed loan 6 to tide her over until she got paid in January.
As such,  Nextcredit didnt consider loans 5 and 6 were consistent  with Mrs B taking loans to 
support her previous borrowing.  
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought carefully about the further  points Nextcredit has made.  I accept its possible that 
Mrs B used loans 5 and 6 as short-term credit to manage the Christmas period and the 
weeks until she was paid in January.
But I remain  mindful that loan 6 was double what shed borrowed for loan 5. And irrespective 
of the time of year, she took loan 6 only a few days after shed repaid loan 5. Loan  6 was 
also her sixth loan in just over seven months.
When I take account of all of these  points, I still think its likely that by loan 6 Mrs B was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the gap repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances, and that her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Overall, Im not persuaded to depart  from the position set out in my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN00142963putting things right   what Nextcredit needs to do
In addition  to the offer Nextcredit  has made for loans 3 and 4, it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs B paid on loan 6;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans  taken by loan 6 means any information recorded about loan 6 is 
adverse. So all entries about  loan 6 should  be removed from Mrs Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Nextcredit to take off tax from this interest. Nextcredit  
must give Mrs B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
Nextcredit must give Mrs B a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I direct Nextcredit  Limited to pay 
compensation to Mrs B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 September  2019.
