K821x#15complaint
Miss N says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her, 
trapping her in a debt spiral.
background
This complaint is about ten loans  Sunny provided  to Miss N between August 2016 and 
August 2017.  Miss Ns borrowing  history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 21/08/2016 27/10/2016  6 £100.00
2 16/03/2017 19/06/2017   6 £100.00
3 20/03/2017 26/07/2017  6 £50.00
4 21/03/2017 19/06/2017  6 £50.00
5 24/03/2017 26/05/2017  6 £50.00
6 17/06/2017 24/07/2017  6 £100.00
7 29/06/2017 30/08/2018  6 £100.00
8 11/08/2017 29/11/2018  6 £200.00
9 17/08/2017 30/08/2018  6 £100.00
10 19/08/2017 30/08/2018  6 £100.00
Miss N has told us that Sunny ought  to have known that she couldnt afford to repay these 
loans. In order to pay them  back she says she would have had to take out more loans, often 
from other lenders.
In its final response Sunny did not uphold Miss Ns complaint. It said it had carried  out the 
necessary checks and based on the low number of loans and the relatively small amount of 
credit provided to them there was no evidence to support the fact that Miss N couldnt afford 
to repay  the loans.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ns complaint and thought the loans from loans 5-10 shouldnt 
have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss N could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN36010392But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss N could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ns complaint. I agree with our adjudicator that loan 
5 onwards should not have been  given to Miss N.
Sunny told us it had carried  out various affordability and credit checks  before it agreed to 
lend to Miss N. Ive looked  at each of the loan amounts for loans 1-4 and Ive taken into 
account what Miss N told Sunny about  her income  which she declared was around £1,180 
per month and her expenses. These loan repayments seemed low in relation to Miss Ns 
income. 
As it was early in the lending relationship, I dont think Sunny needed to verify this 
information. On the face of it although by loan 4 Miss N still had loans  2 and 3 outstanding, 
on balance, I dont  think I can safely say that Sunny failed to do enough when it was making 
its assessment about the first four loans. At this time, Miss N was a new customer  and I think  
in the particular circumstances of this case,  I dont think  it would have been proportionate to 
ask for any further information which might have indicated repayment of the loans  was 
unsustainable. So, I cant say Sunny  did anything  wrong in providing Miss N with loans 1-4.
However, when Sunny  gave Miss N loan 5, as our adjudicator has explained by this time 
Miss N still had loans 2,3 and 4 outstanding  so this should have alerted Sunny to the 
possibility that she was having longer term problems managing  her money.  It looks as 
Ref: DRN36010393though she was taking out smaller  sums in very quick  succession. By loan 5 Miss N had 
taken out four loans within eight days.
All of these circumstances  suggest  that Miss N wasnt  managing  her money.  So I dont think 
it was likely Miss N could  repay this loan in a sustainable way.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ns case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because by loan 6 Miss N appears to have been  persistently reliant  on 
short term loans:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss N was not managing  to repay  her loans 
sustainably. Miss N had taken out six loans in nearly  ten months. Although there  was a short 
gap of just less than five months between when  she paid off loan 1 and took out loan 2, after 
that Miss N had been indebted to Sunny for the whole period and she still had previous 
loans outstanding. So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Miss N was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loans were leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ns first loan was for £100.00 and loan 6 was also for £100. But Miss N was also still 
repaying loans  2, 3, and 4 when she took out loan 6. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Miss N was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in her income but 
to meet  an ongoing  need. 
From loan 6 onwards Miss N was provided  with a new loan within  days of taking out earlier  
loans and while she still had outstanding  amounts to repay on her previous loans.
Miss N wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 10 was taken 
out almost twelve months after Miss Ns first. And although it was for the same  amount, she 
was still repaying previous loans in addition to loan 10. Miss N had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss N lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ns indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss N borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ns ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 5 and loans 6-10 and Sunny should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN36010394putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss N paid on 5-10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans loan 5 from Miss Ns credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 -10 should be removed from Miss 
Ns credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ns complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 April 2020.
