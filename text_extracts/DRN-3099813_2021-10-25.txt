The complaint
Mrs T complains about the increase to the premium charged by AXA PPP Healthcare 
Limited for her private medical insurance policy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service generally takes the view that its up to an insurer to decide how much to charge 
for its policies. As our investigator has explained, so long as the insurer exercises that 
judgment fairly and consistently, its a matter in which this service wouldnt normally 
interfere. 
AXA has provided this service with details of how it calculated Mrs Ts renewal premium. I 
cant share this with Mrs T because the information is commercially sensitive. But Ive 
checked the figures and Im satisfied the premium was calculated accurately. 
Although I cant share the information with Mrs T, I can confirm that the majority of the 
increase to her premium was due to the reduction in her no claims discount (NCD). As set 
out in the policy terms, because Mrs T made a claim in the previous policy year, her NCD fell 
three levels from the maximum level of 50% down to 35% at renewal. 
I do understand Mrs Ts disappointment at being charged a higher premium than shed 
previously been paying. However, based on the information Ive seen, I think AXA has acted 
fairly and has charged Mrs T the same as anyone else in the same position as her.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
