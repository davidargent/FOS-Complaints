The complaint
Mr I complains about how NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Card handled a chargeback 
request.
What happened
In November 2021, Mr I ordered a laptop from an online retailer. When the laptop arrived, 
Mr I says he noticed that it was faulty. He says he needed a laptop urgently, so he ordered 
another from the same retailer. To buy both laptops, Mr I used his credit card account with 
NewDay. 
Once Mr I received the second laptop, he says he found it was also faulty. Mr I contacted the 
online retailer and NewDay, to try and return both laptops and get a refund for the amounts 
debited from his account. 
NewDay were successful in their chargeback attempt for the first laptop and Mr I received a 
full refund. But, the chargeback for the second laptop wasnt successful. Because Mr I said 
he had returned both items, he complained to NewDay about how theyd handled his claim. 
In a final response to the complaint, NewDay told Mr I that the retailer had defended the 
chargeback and said the second laptop hadnt been returned. Mr I disagreed and explained 
that he had already provided proof to show he had returned the second laptop. 
NewDay sent a further final response to Mr I and said they couldnt reopen a chargeback 
claim that had already been decided. They also paid £15 to Mr Is account for the service he 
had received and offered to start a claim, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
(section 75). A third final response letter was sent from NewDay to Mr I a few weeks later, 
reiterating what they had told him. 
Mr I received a refund directly from the retailer for the second laptop, around the time 
NewDay sent the third final response letter to him. But, because he was unhappy with how 
NewDay had treated his request for a refund, Mr I brought his complaint to us. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Is complaint and found that he hadnt brought it to us 
in time. He said Mr I had contacted us more than six months since NewDay had sent him 
their first final response letter. So, under our rules, we didnt have the power to consider 
things. 
Mr I didnt agree and said NewDay had sent two further final response letters, which means 
the time to bring a complaint to us was extended. And because of that, he did contact us 
within the time limit of six months. 
The investigator didnt change his conclusions and Mr Is case was passed to me to make a 
decision. After looking at the letters NewDay sent to Mr I, I decided that his complaint was 
brought to us in time. So, I went on to consider Mr Is case about how NewDay treated him 
when he requested a refund for the second laptop.
I sent Mr I and NewDay my provisional decision on this case, on 6 July 2023. I explained 
why I think the complaint should be upheld. A copy of my provisional findings is included 
below:
Raising a chargeback is a way that NewDay can try to recover money that was paid using 
Mr Is credit card. However, it is not guaranteed to succeed and is governed by particular 
scheme rules. I have considered the circumstances of this case alongside the requirements 
of the chargeback scheme. It isnt entirely clear what dispute reason code NewDay used 
here  but it seems likely it used a code relevant to goods/services being not as described or 
defective. 
The chargeback for the first laptop was raised by NewDay on 30 November 2021 and Mr I 
received a refund back to his account a few days later. Mr I hasnt brought a concern to us 
about the chargeback claim for the first laptop, so Ive not considered this any further. 
However, I can see from NewDays notes that Mr I raised a chargeback for the second 
laptop, also on 30 November 2021. Here, the notes go on to show that the supplier of the 
laptop had told them that Mr I hadnt returned the second laptop. By 22 January 2022, 
NewDay found that they didnt have enough evidence from Mr I to dispute what the supplier 
had said and so they declined Mr Is chargeback query. 
Having thought carefully about the circumstances, I accept that NewDay didnt have enough 
information on 22 January 2022, to take Mr Is chargeback query to arbitration. 
But, I can see from NewDays notes, that Mr I got back in touch with them again five days 
later. This time, Mr I provided NewDay with a copy of an email conversation with the supplier 
dated 24 January 2022. Within the conversation, the supplier said: 
We have researched this matter and have confirmed that the dispute in question has 
been resolved between (the supplier is named) and your card issuer. 
The email also says: 
Please contact your card issuer for more information about reimbursement for this 
purchase. 
I think this email shows that the supplier had organised a refund directly with NewDay. So, 
given the information Mr I had sent to NewDay shortly after his chargeback query was 
declined, I think NewDay were in the position to look into things again. Consequently, I think 
NewDay had options to consider arbitration with the card scheme, or to raise a section 75 
dispute. 
Having considered all the evidence, I cannot see that NewDay looked to take forward either 
of those options. Instead, it was left for Mr I to further complain to NewDay and reiterate 
what the supplier had told him. It wasnt until 9 March 2022, where NewDay offered to begin 
a section 75 claim regarding the transaction for the second laptop.
Ive looked at NewDays notes for the section 75 claim and I can see that the supplier told 
them, on or around 21 March 2022, that they had issued a refund for the second laptop to 
Mr Is account. I can see from the statements for Mr Is credit card account that the refund for 
the second laptop was itemised on 18 March 2022. 
NewDay have told us that in the end, they didnt need to obtain the refund using a section 75 
claim, because it was resolved directly by the supplier. I think this is supported by the email, 
from the supplier, that Mr I had sent to NewDay, two months beforehand. Overall, I think that because NewDay didnt further the chargeback, or a section 75 claim in 
January 2022, they deprived Mr I of a reasonable opportunity to get his money back sooner. 
Im persuaded that NewDay caused a delay from 22 January 2022 until 18 March 2022. This 
means Mr I could have got the cost of the second laptop back some seven weeks sooner 
than he did. 
Although Mr I has told us he was relieved to finally get a refund from the supplier, hes also 
explained he suffered from anxiety and worry during this time. Mr I has also spoken about 
the cost of the laptop and the impact of being without those funds. This is in addition to the 
impact of going back and forth to NewDay and the supplier. 
While I acknowledge that NewDay have already paid £15 to Mr I, in all the circumstances I 
think NewDay should increase that award. So, I think its fair for NewDay to pay Mr I an 
additional £100 for the distress and inconvenience he has experienced.
Both Mr I and NewDay responded to the provisional decision and accepted it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr I and NewDay both accepted my findings, I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
For these reasons, NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Card should pay Mr I £100 for the 
distress and inconvenience he experienced.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon 
Card to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2023.
