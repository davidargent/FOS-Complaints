The complaint
Mr M complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC (AvantCredit) lent him a loan he couldnt 
afford.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them all again
here.
AvantCredit lent Mr M £3000 in May 2015, this is not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the 
reasons for my decision about this loan. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The investigator concluded AvantCredit did not make a fair lending decision. They concluded 
that Mr M was paying a significant amount in credit commitments each month and wouldnt 
have been able to sustainably repay the loan repayment from this loan. I agree with the 
investigators findings for these reasons:
oAvantCredit says it carried out proportionate checks before agreeing to lend to Mr M. 
It says it asked him about his income and expenditure costs. In addition, it carried out 
a credit check. It says it also verified Mr Ms income. It says used the information it 
gathered to assess the affordability of the loan for Mr M.
oThe loan was due to be repaid over 48 monthly instalments of around £165 and 
AvantCredit recorded down that Mr M was using the loan for debt consolidation. 
When I look at AvantCredit calculations, I can see that, on the surface of it, it had 
worked out that Mr M would have enough disposable income to afford the loan 
repayments. But like the investigator, on balance I dont think AvantCredit made a fair 
lending decision with what it had in front of it.
oI say this because when I look at the credit search results AvantCredit gathered and 
would have had in front of it, I can see that it showed Mr M had existing credit 
commitments of £1189 a month. This represented around 66% of Mr Ms total 
monthly income. I think this ought to have given AvantCredit concerns about his 
ability to repay this loan in a sustainable way. Especially as this loan was to be 
provided over a term of 4 years. 
oAvantCredit has recently submitted to our service calculations that it has made in 
relation to debt consolidation. It has worked out how much it thinks Mr M would have 
needed to repay from his credit commitments at that time in addition to the 
repayment amount from this loan, if he had used all of the £3000 capital to repay 
debt. It calculated that he would repay around £749 a month including the repayment 
for this loan after consolidation. But I have not seen anything from the time it granted 
the loan, about this debt consolidation and whether it had discussed this with Mr M. 
Or whether Mr M was proposing to consolidate in the way AvantCredit now says he 
could have done. But even if he did, the debt consolidation worked out by 
AvantCredit would still leave Mr M with monthly repayments of around £749 a month. 
This would represent around 42% of Mr Ms monthly income and I would consider 
this to be a significant amount for him to repay over 4 years. I think on balance, Mr M 
would have struggled to repay this amount in a sustainable way. And, so in these 
circumstances with what it had in front of it and from the information it gathered, 
AvantCredit should reasonably have concluded that it was not fair to lend to Mr M.
oSo, it follows that I uphold Mr Ms complaint. AvantCredit now needs to put things 
right.
Putting things right
While I think AvantCredit shouldnt have lent to Mr M, I think it will be fair for him to repay the 
capital of £3000 which he borrowed. So, to put things right, AvantCredit should:
add up all the payments made by Mr M, if it exceeds the capital amount of £1500, 
then the overpayments plus 8% simple interest* should be paid to Mr M, remove any 
adverse information recorded on Mr M credit file as a result of this loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from the interest payment referred to 
above. AvantCredit must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he asks it for 
one.
My final decision
My final decision is that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld and I direct AvantCredit of UK 
LLC to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 May 2022.
