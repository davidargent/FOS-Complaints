The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has registered a late payment marker 
on his credit file.
What happened
Mr A says he set up a direct debit to pay his PayPal credit account balance, but it still 
registered a late payment marker on his credit file. He says that he has been denied credit 
as a result and says the mistake must be PayPals in not setting the direct debit up correctly 
or failing to take the money. Mr A says he has set up numerous direct debits without issue 
and would like the adverse information removed from his credit file.
PayPal says its account terms and conditions make clear that a missed payment may affect 
a credit file. It says it e-mailed Mr A on 9 September 2020 about setting a direct debit 
payment up and says he made a payment himself in October 2020 that was rejected by his 
bank. PayPal says Mr A made a payment in December 2020 and on that occasion set up the 
direct debit. It says e-mails were sent to Mr A about the missed payment.
Mr A brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought Mr A had made a late payment and PayPal in line with agreed account terms and 
conditions was entitled to register a late payment on Mr As credit file. The investigator also 
thought there was no direct debit set up until December 2020 and Mr A had made payments 
himself up to that point.
Mr A doesnt accept that view and says the direct debit was set up in July 2020 and it must 
be PayPals systems at fault.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall decision that I dont uphold this complaint.
I have looked at Mr As account terms and conditions which I think he would have agreed to 
when the account was opened. Those terms and conditions make clear that in the event of a 
late or missed payment, that information is reported to the Credit Reference Agencies 
(CRAs). So, I dont think PayPal made a mistake or acted unfairly by telling the CRAs that 
Mr A had missed a required payment. I also think that a business has a regulatory duty to 
report accurate information about its customers accounts to the CRAs.
I have looked carefully at PayPals records and can see that in September 2020 it e-mailed 
Mr A about setting up a direct debit. I can also see that in October 2020 Mr A made a 
payment to PayPal that was later rejected by his bank. So, I think it clear at that stage there 
was no direct debit in place and think Mr A ought reasonably to have been aware of that as 
he was making payments himself to PayPal. I also think it Mr As responsibility to make sure 
the payments were made and can see that PayPal e-mailed him about the missed payment.
Im satisfied that the direct debit was set up in December 2020 following a payment made by 
Mr A. I appreciate Mr A says the direct debit was set up in July 2020, but I have not seen 
any evidence of that or any mistake by PayPal in failing to take the direct debit. I have made 
clear to Mr A that I think it was his responsibility to make the payments and can see that he 
must have known there was no direct debit in place otherwise why make manual payments 
before the direct debit was set up in December 2020.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal was obliged to report the missed payment to the CRAs and that 
its Mr As responsibility to make required payments. I have not seen any evidence of a 
system failure by PayPal and think the direct debit was not set up until December 2020. For 
that reason, I cant fairly order PayPal remove any adverse information about a late payment 
from Mr As credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
