K820x#14complaint
Miss J complains  that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional  sale agreement with 
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited,  trading as Barclays Partner Finance, wasnt  of 
satisfactory quality. Shes also complained about  the damage  caused to her drive by an oil 
leak, the time taken  to repair  the car and the mileage  recorded in its service  history.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Barclays Partner Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss J - whether or not it 
was of satisfactory quality  at that time will depend on a number of factors,  including  
the age and mileage of the car and the price  that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss J was about  three years old, had been driven for 
50,138 miles and had a price  of £8,973.23;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied  to Miss J in late August 2018 and she says that about three 
days later she noticed that the car had leaked  oil onto her driveway;
the dealer  repaired  the leak  but the repair took about ten weeks  during which  time 
she was provided  with a courtesy  car;
Ive seen no evidence  to show that the repair wasnt successful  and, though I can 
understand the frustration that she feels because she didnt have her car for ten 
weeks, I consider that the repair was an acceptable remedy for the oil leak and Im 
not persuaded that Barclays Partner  Finance needs to take any further  action about 
it;
Miss J now says that the fuel injectors  need  to be replaced and that will cost her 
£374  but Ive seen  no evidence to show that the injectors were faulty when the car 
was supplied (and if the injectors had been faulty at that time, I consider it to be more 
likely than not that they would have needed to be replaced  sooner than they have),  
so Im not persuaded that theres  enough evidence to show  that the car wasnt  of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss J because of an issue  with the fuel 
injectors;
the agreement  and invoice for the car show that its mileage was 50,138  when it was 
supplied to Miss J in August 2018,  and the cars first MOT test was in April 2018 
when its mileage was recorded as 49,448 - but the cars service history  records its 
mileage as being 37,500 when it was serviced in June  2018;
Ref: DRN78603242I consider it to be more likely than not that the mileage of 37,500  recorded  in the cars 
service history is incorrect and results from a human error  Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the cars  mileage of 50,138  when it was 
supplied to Miss J was incorrect or that the cars  mileage was misrepresented  to her;
when Miss J complained to Barclays Partner Finance about these issues  it asked for 
more evidence about the damage to her drive  but it says that she didnt provide it 
with any further  evidence  and Im not persuaded that shes  provided enough 
evidence to show that her drive  has been  damaged by an oil leak from the car;
Miss J says that the car should be replaced or she should receive a full refund  but I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has responded  fairly and reasonably  to her 
complaint; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance  to allow Miss J to reject the car, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
my final decision
So my decision is that I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 August 2020.
