The complaint
Mr W complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that he 
returned when he ended his hire purchase agreement.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in July 2022 in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
A used car was supplied to Mr W under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-
Benz Finance that he electronically signed in July 2018. The car was collected from 
him in August 2021, when the agreement ended, by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance. The third party inspected the car and completed a vehicle 
condition report. The report said that a second inspection was required but identified 
some damage to the car.
The car was inspected again four days later and further damage was identified. A 
second vehicle condition report was completed which said that the total cost for 
twelve itemised issues was £1,244.01. Mercedes-Benz Finance charged that amount 
to Mr W but he complained to it about the charges. It confirmed that £1,244.01 worth 
of damage had been identified and set out the reasons for the charges under its 
vehicle return standards  but it included a charge of £110 for damage to the left rear 
alloy wheel which hadnt been included on the second vehicle condition report and 
which increased the total cost to £1,354.01. Mr W wasnt satisfied with its response 
so complained to this service.
Our investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld in part. He said 
that it was reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Mr W for the damage to 
the bonnet, front bumper, seat base cover, rear wiper blade, steering column shrouds 
and right front wing. Mercedes-Benz Finance provided further evidence about some 
of the other damage charges and Mr W said that the damage to the front bumper and 
seat base cover hadnt been identified on the second vehicle condition report and 
hadnt been included in the invoice or Mercedes-Benz Finances response to his 
complaint. Our investigator then said that it was fair and reasonable for Mercedes-
Benz Finance to charge for damage to three alloy wheels and the left rear door shut 
(in addition to damage the bonnet, rear wiper blade, steering column shrouds and 
right front wing). The total cost for that damage was £953.61.
Mercedes-Benz Finance has accepted that recommendation but Mr D has asked for 
his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He discussed his complaint with 
our investigator and said that he wouldnt pay for the charge for the left rear alloy and 
hed also like to raise an issue about the sales commission model that was used by 
Mercedes-Benz Finance but not communicated to him at the point of supply. Our 
investigator said that that would be considered to be a separate complaint so should 
be raised with Mercedes-Benz Finance.
I set out my provisional findings in that provisional decision which were that: I consider that 
Mr Ws complaint should be upheld in part for these reasons:
the vehicle return standards which were part of the hire purchase agreement say: 
When it is time to return your vehicle  you must return the vehicle in line with the 
Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is returned to us a Vehicle Return 
Standard Inspection will be carried out by trained technicians at the nominated 
Defleet Centre. The vehicle must be: free from any broken or damaged items ; free 
from any defects or condition that would be in breach of statutory requirements; free 
from accident damage; and in good, clean and marketable condition  the standards 
then explain what would be acceptable and unacceptable;
the car was collected from Mr W in August 2021 by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance and a vehicle condition report was completed which 
identified some issues with the car but it said that the repair method was to be 
advised and no repair value was specified  the report also said that a second 
inspection was required;
a second inspection took place four days later at an inspection compound and a 
second vehicle condition report was completed which said that the total cost for 
twelve itemised issues was £1,244.01 - Mercedes-Benz Finance charged that 
amount to Mr W but he complained to it about the charges;
I consider that it was consistent with the vehicle return standards for the second 
inspection to take place and I dont consider that Mercedes-Benz Finance acted 
incorrectly when it relied on the second vehicle condition report for the damage 
charges;
Mercedes-Benz Finance confirmed to Mr W that £1,244.01 worth of damages had 
been identified and set out the reasons for those charges under its vehicle return 
standards  but it included a charge of £110 for damage to the left rear alloy wheel 
which hadnt been included on the second vehicle condition report and which 
increased the total cost to £1,354.01;
the first vehicle condition report said that there was no visible damage to the left 
rear wheel, the photo of the wheel included with that report doesnt show any 
damage to the alloy wheel and the second vehicle condition report didnt identify any 
damage to the left rear alloy so no charge for that damage was included on the 
invoice that was sent to Mr W  Mercedes-Benz Finance has provided a photo 
showing some damage to that wheel but I dont consider that it was fair or 
reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to add a charge of £110 for damage to that 
wheel after Mr W had complained to it;
I consider that the evidence that Mercedes-Benz Finance has provided (including the 
two vehicle condition reports and photos of the damage) shows that there was 
damage to the left and right front alloy wheels, the bonnet, the left rear door shut, the 
upper and lower steering column shrouds and the right front wing  and I consider 
that that damage was unacceptable damage in accordance with the vehicle return 
standards and was more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and 
tear;
the cars mileage when it was collected from Mr W was 45,092 miles and its mileage 
at the time of the second inspection was 45,177 miles and Im not persuaded that its 
likely that the damage was caused after the car was collected from Mr W - I consider 
it to be more likely than not that the damage was present when the car was collected 
from him;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Mr W for 
that damage and I consider that the charges for that damage that were included in the second vehicle condition report and which total £843.61 are fair and reasonable 
in these circumstances;
our investigator didnt consider that the other charges included on the invoice were 
fair or reasonable and Mercedes-Benz has accepted his recommendation  and I 
also dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to 
charge Mr W for those items;
Mr W says that hed also like to raise an issue about the sales commission model 
that was used by Mercedes-Benz Finance but not communicated to him at the point 
of supply, but that wasnt included in his complaint to Mercedes-Benz Finance (or this 
service) so Im unable to consider it as part of this complaint  if Mr W wants to 
complain about that he should first complain to Mercedes-Benz Finance and then, if 
hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a separate complaint to 
this service; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz 
Finance to reduce the amount that its charged Mr W for damage to the car to 
£843.61.
Subject to any further representations by Mr W or Mercedes-Benz Finance, my provisional 
decision was that I intended to uphold this complaint in part. Mercedes-Benz Finance says 
that its happy with my provisional decision and Mr W has confirmed that hes received it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I see no reason to change the findings that I set out in my provisional 
decision.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz Finance 
to reduce the amount that its charged Mr W for damage to the car to £843.61.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ws complaint in part and I order Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, to reduce the amount that its 
charged Mr W for damage to the car to £843.61.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
