K820x#14complaint
Mr R has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny. Mr R says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr R took out 5 loans from Sunny between  January and March 2017. Ive 
enclosed a summary of Mr Rs borrowing with Sunny,  based  on the information it provided to 
us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision.  
 
Im sorry  Mr R has had to wait a while for his complaint to get to this stage. Nevertheless, 
one of our adjudicators has recently  re-looked into the complaint and said they didnt think  it 
should be upheld.  Ive been asked  to make an ombudsmans  final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Rs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr R could 
repay the loans  he was given in a sustainable  manner.  These  checks ought to have taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer.  These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income)
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Ive carefully  considered all of these things 
and what they mean  for Mr Rs complaint. Sunny  told us it carried out certain checks before 
agreeing to lend to Mr R, including  assessing  his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. 
Ref: DRN76595202It says that based  on what was said,  this information showed that Mr R would  be able to 
make the loan repayments he was committing to on all 5 occasions. 
Im afraid I too dont  think  theres enough evidence to uphold his complaint. For all 5 loans, 
he declared his net income at the time (after  tax) as £2,100  per month  and he also provided  
details about his expenditure. I think the repayments on the first 2 loans were  affordable,  not 
least because the amounts  being borrowed were quite moderate.  It seems to me the 
repayments were within  Mr Rs capacity  to repay given  what hed declared his income  to be. 
I also take account of what  Ive said above,  about the length of the lending relationship, and 
given that this was still in its early stages I dont think Sunny would have been carrying  out 
financial checks that were  particularly in-depth. I do think the checks  were  appropriate  to the 
circumstances thus far though. So I dont uphold the complaint about loans 1 or 2.
By the time we get to loan number 3 I note the amount  being  lent to Mr R did increase and 
this loan was provided whilst loans 1 and 2 were still outstanding. So I can see that more  
comprehensive financial checks  might  have been called for and theres no evidence Sunny  
did this. However, looking  at what Mr R had said about his own finances and his ability to 
pay the loans  back, I dont  actually  think Sunny would have thought further  lending  was a 
risk. And Ive not been  presented with any evidence that shows  Mr R couldnt make the 
increased monthly payments for loan number 3, or was otherwise in financial distress. 
For loan numbers 4 and 5, I think the same things apply; no information  has been put 
forward to show Mr R couldnt  sustainably  afford  the repayments or was having trouble 
managing money.  By the time of loan 4, for example, hed paid back loans  1 and 2; and by 
loan 5, the amount he asked for reduced significantly again. So he did seem to be making 
steady progress in paying back what hed borrowed.  
The evidence Ive seen  shows Mr Rs relationship with Sunny was brief and therefore 
somewhat in accordance with what Id consider short-term loans to be for. He went on to pay 
back all the loans. Im sorry to disappoint  him. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. And I dont  direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr R any compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 July 2020.
