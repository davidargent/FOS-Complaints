Mr and Mrs R say Nationwide Building Society mis-sold them two payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policies.  
background and summary to complaint
Mr and Mrs R bought  the first policy in 1996  at the same time as taking out a loan. 
Nationwide cannot  confirm how the loan was applied for but  Mr and Mrs R say they applied  
for the loan and PPI policy in a branch meeting. 
Because of the length or time that has passed  there  are no details of the loan available.  
It isnt known whether  the loan was secured or unsecured and the amount and repayment 
term is unknown. Nationwide has shown  us screenshots to show  the PPI policy cost £27.54 
per month. 
The policy provided  cover  for Mr R for accident, sickness,  unemployment  subject  to its 
exclusions and limitations. If the loan was secured it offered to repay Mr and Mrs Rs 
monthly loan repayment for up to 24 months in the event of a successful disability claim and 
12 in the event of unemployment. It would also have repaid the outstanding balance if Mr R 
had died.
If the loan was unsecured it offered to repay Mr and Mrs Rs monthly loan repayment  until 
Mr R recovered and returned to work or the loan ended in the event of a successful  disability 
claim and for 12 months in the event  of unemployment. It would also have repaid the 
outstanding balance if Mr R or Mrs R had died.
  
At the time,  Mr R was employed  as a metal sorter.  He has told us he was entitled  to at least  
three months sick pay should he be unable to work. Mr R would also have been eligible for a 
redundancy payment if hed lost his job. Mr and Mrs R have also said they had some 
savings they could rely on.
Mr R broke  his arm many years before taking out the policy. But hes told us he was in good 
health at the time of the sale. 
In 1998 Mr and Mrs R took out a new, unsecured personal loan, part of which  was used to 
repay the first loan.  They applied for the new loan and PPI using an application form that 
was available  in Nationwide  branches. The original PPI policy  was cancelled and Mr and  
Mrs R were sold a new PPI policy  covering  the new loan. 
The policys  one-off upfront  premium of £2,133.75 was paid in advance by being  added to 
the loan (a single premium) where  it attracted interest over the term of the loan.  The loan 
was repayable over a 60-month term and the policy term matched that of the loan. The 
monthly loan repayment was £248.86 with the PPI costing an additional £47.09  making the 
total monthly repayment £311.95. 
The policy provided  cover  for Mr R for accident, sickness,  unemployment and life subject to 
its exclusions and limitations.  It offered to repay  Mr and Mrs Rs monthly loan repayment  for 
up to 60 months in the event of a successful  disability  claim and 12 in the event of 
unemployment. It would also have cleared the outstanding balance if Mr R had died. 
Ref: DRN49235372Mr and Mrs Rs circumstances remained largely the same as they were in 1996.
Nationwide has sent us screenshots to show that the first loan account closed in 1998 and 
the second in 2000.
Mr and Mrs Rs representative has made lengthy  and substantial  representations on their 
behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mr and Mrs Rs representative says:
Nationwide failed  to meet  the sales standards which  applied  at the time. In those  
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  APP 3, it should be presumed  Mr and Mrs R 
wouldnt have taken  out the policies  and the complaint should be upheld. Mr and      
Mrs Rs representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policies excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress, which are some of 
the most  common reasons people are off work.  This significantly reduced the value 
of cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policies  were of inherently poor value as shown by the 
low claims ratio.  The common law duty of utmost good faith means  Nationwide 
should have told Mr and Mrs R about the poor value; 
The cancellation terms  of the second  policy were unfair;
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Nationwide  should have 
explained the significance of the exclusions and limitations of cover to Mr and Mrs R 
and the impact they would have had on their chances of making a claim; and
The information Mr and Mrs R received was misleading. These  policies were  
promoted as providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations 
on the scope of the cover meant  this was untrue.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mr and Mrs R disagreed with the adjudicators 
opinion for several  reasons. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
Ref: DRN49235373When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr and Mrs Rs. I dont intend to set that 
out in much detail  here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs Rs complaint
These sales took place  in 1996 and 1998  before the General  Insurance Standards Council 
(GISC) published its code of practice  in June 2000 and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreements concluded in 1998  and 2000. That means the unfair relationship  
provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit  Act, the Supreme Court judgment in 
Plevin about s.140  of that Act and the rules and guidance made  by the FCA about the 
handling of complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the Plevin 
judgment, arent applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Nationwide at the time. So Im satisfied I should  take the ABI code and 
these other  publications into account when deciding, what  is in my opinion,  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Rs case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, contract  (including the express  and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost  duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Building  Societies 
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Building  Societies  Ombudsmans terms of reference  the Ombudsman  
was required to decide complaints by reference to what  was, in his opinion, fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances.
Ref: DRN49235374Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so 
Nationwide was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  
guidance when  considering Mr and Mrs Rs complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If Nationwide gave  advice, whether  it advised  Mr and Mrs R with reasonable care 
and skill  in particular, whether the policies were appropriate or suitable for them,  
given their needs and circumstances. 
-Whether Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs R sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about whether  to take out the policies, 
including drawing  to their attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not 
misleading way  the main provisions of the policy  and significant  limitations  and 
exclusions. 
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mr and 
Mrs R, I must then go on to consider whether and to what  extent Mr and Mrs R 
suffered loss or damage and what  I consider  would amount to fair compensation for 
that loss or damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mr and Mrs R 
and Nationwide, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Rs complaint. Ive set out my 
reasoning below. 
did Mr and Mrs R know they had a choice?
Nationwide had to make it clear that the PPI policies were optional.  
Ive seen a copy  of the application form for the second loan taken in 1998.  I can see the 
application form has a section about PPI. And there are statements which  could be ticked  to 
decline or accept PPI. And I can see Mr and Mrs R have ticked  the statement to show  they 
required PPI cover.
Nationwide does not have the original paperwork for the first loan. But Ive seen samples of 
both secured and unsecured loan agreements from the time of the sale.  And I can see that 
both describe the PPI as being  optional.
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Mr and Mrs R knew the policies 
were optional and they agreed  to take them  out without undue pressure. 
Ref: DRN49235375did Nationwide provide  advice?
Nationwide says it didnt  provide advice  during  these  sales. Mr and Mrs R have not told us if 
they think advice  was given. From  experience  I am aware Nationwide generally didnt give 
advice on these types of policies. Looking  at what happened when Nationwide  sold Mr and 
Mrs R the PPI, Im not persuaded that it provided advice. 
This means  Nationwide  didnt have to check if the PPI was suitable  for Mr and Mrs R. 
Instead, it had to give them sufficient, appropriate and timely information  to enable Mr and 
Mrs R to make an informed choice about whether to take out the policies,  including  drawing 
to their attention  and highlighting  in a clear,  fair and not misleading  way  the main 
provisions of the policies and significant limitations and exclusions. 
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mr and Mrs R were given a broad description  of 
what the policies  were intended  to cover (that is that the policies would protect  their 
payments if Mr R was unable to work through accident, sickness  and unemployment.)  I have 
reached this conclusion because I think its unlikely Mr and Mrs R would have taken out the 
policy without any sense  of what the policy was. The monthly premium of the first policy   
would have been set out on the credit  agreement.
And I think Mr and Mrs R knew that the single  premium  being added to the second  loan was 
£2,133.75 and the monthly cost was £47.09  each  month (as this information was, in my 
view, sufficiently clear on the loan agreement Mr and Mrs R signed.)  
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  Nationwide gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit - or about the exclusions or limitations before Mr 
and Mrs R agreed to take out the policies.  
So I dont  think Nationwide gave Mr and Mrs R sufficient, appropriate and timely information 
to enable them to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policies, including 
drawing their attention  and highlighting  in a clear,  fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policies and significant limitations and exclusions. 
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mr and Mrs Rs representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mr and 
Mrs Rs. Ive considered these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mr and Mrs Rs representative considers to be 
poor value   and the fact that much of the premiums went  to the business rather 
than the insurer.  
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mr and Mrs R about the limitations  and exclusions,  it should have gone further 
and explained  the significance of them  to them. 
Ref: DRN49235376Im not persuaded by Mr and Mrs Rs representatives views on this. The duty of utmost 
good faith in insurance law imposed a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose 
material facts and not to make material misrepresentations.  While I cant be certain what a 
court would say  I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer  
having to disclose the claims ratio information or explaining the significance of the limitations 
and exclusions in the way Mr and Mrs R has suggested. And taking  into account the law, 
industry codes and standards of good  industry  practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont  
think its fair and reasonable to conclude that Nationwide  ought to have done either. 
What effect did Nationwides shortcomings  have on Mr and Mrs R? To what extent did 
Mr and Mrs R suffer  loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Nationwide didnt  do all it should  have  done  when it sold these policies to      
Mr and Mrs R. So Ive gone  on to consider  whether it would be fair and reasonable to 
conclude Mr and Mrs R suffered loss and damage as a result.  To answer  this, I must decide 
whether or not Mr and Mrs R would have still taken out the policies, had Nationwide done 
things properly. 
Mr and Mrs R says they would not have taken  them out and believes I should presume this 
to be the case  given the significant failings identified above.  Ive considered the 
representations of both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
As these  was a non-advised sales, Mr and Mrs R had to weigh up in their own minds  the 
cost of the policies against the benefits  offered and the potential  consequences if they didnt 
insure against the risk of being unable to work. 
As Ive found above, Mr and Mrs R chose to take the policies out. So I consider that its 
reasonable to conclude  they had some  interest  in the benefits offered by this type of 
insurance. But they made this decision based on incomplete information. So what Mr and 
Mrs R thought they were  getting is not exactly what they got. The extent to which  this 
differed is a relevant consideration when determining if Mr and Mrs R has suffered  any loss 
or detriment.  
As Ive already  said, the information Mr and Mrs R were given about the cost was clear.  But 
the information about other aspects of the policies, such  as the limitations and exclusions 
wasnt as clear as it should have been. 
Im not persuaded Nationwide made clear exactly what Mr and Mrs R would get back  in 
return in the event they made a successful  claim.  But I think  its unlikely Mr and Mrs Rs 
expectations about what the policies  would pay in the event of a claim (an amount sufficient 
to meet  their loan payments) were significantly different  to what the policies actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mr and Mrs R thought they had 
bought and what they actually bought  were  the following:
The policies excluded claims relating to medical conditions that Mr R knew  about  or 
ought to have known about  before the start date of the policies; 
The policies limited,  and in some situations,  excluded unemployment cover if Mr R 
wasnt a permanent employee.
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mr R be unable  to 
do his own job or any work  as certified by a doctor.
Ref: DRN49235377I do accept that there is a possibility the limitations  and exclusions above  might well have 
caused Mr and Mrs R pause  for thought  and may well have caused them to conclude  that 
the policies were not as good  as they thought and they might have decided not to proceed. 
The limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might 
have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mr and Mrs R from 
taking out the policies.  
But, the evidence  about Mr and Mrs Rs circumstances at the time of sale shows  that the 
policies were not fundamentally wrong  or unsuitable  for them.  Mr R was eligible for the 
benefits and they provided cover that, despite  its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved 
valuable to them should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent  seen any 
evidence to suggest they wouldve been caught  by any of the significant  exclusions  Mr R 
didnt have any pre-existing  medical conditions and was in permanent  employment. So, I still 
think they had some good reasons  to take the policies  out.
The policies didnt  exclude back or mental health  conditions or place any additional 
restrictions or more onerous  evidential  requirements in the event of a claim on those 
grounds than would have applied to any other  disability claim. And I think its unlikely Mr R 
would have expected to make a disability claim on the policies without  first providing some  
evidence to support  that claim.
If Mr and Mrs R had known Mr R could only claim for disability if he was not only unable  to 
do his job or any similar  job but also unable to do any job it might have played into their 
thinking about what they would do. And I accept it may have given them  pause  for thought  
although given  their circumstances and the limited other means  they had to make  their 
repayments if Mr R was not working,  on balance, I still think  they would have been interested  
in taking out the cover.
The second  PPI policy was paid for with a single premium. This type of policy can be 
inflexible as they generally dont provide a pro-rata  refund if cancelled early. But this 
particular policy did provide a pro-rata refund if it was cancelled early, so the policy provided 
flexibility if Mr and Mrs R decided to repay the loan early and cancel the policy.
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mr and Mrs R would still have taken out the policies. The policies were  sufficiently 
close to what its likely  they thought they were getting and provided benefits  that would help 
them manage the consequences were  Mr R made redundant, or unable to work  through 
accident or disability.  In the circumstances I consider  it more  likely than not that Mr and     
Mrs R would have taken  out the policies  in any event notwithstanding  the limitations on 
cover.
Mr and Mrs Rs representatives say the rules  about  how to handle  PPI complaints (DISP 
App 3) make it clear that, where a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ref: DRN49235378Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances,  DISP  App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mr and Mrs R would not have bought the PPI they bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there  is evidence  to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted  
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mr and 
Mrs Rs circumstances as detailed above,  I consider it reasonable to conclude the position 
Mr and Mrs R found themselves in as result of the sales was the same  position they would 
have been in had the breach or significant  failings  not occurred. 
Mr and Mrs R believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  
process were immaterial, that the flaws  in this case were highly material and we have  failed 
to give proper weight  to the evidence   including their own comments that they would not 
have taken out the policies. I am not persuaded by these arguments.  
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), Im only doing  so because I dont consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mr and Mrs R in the position they would have been in if 
they had not bought the policies. 
That is because,  while I accept its possible they wouldnt have taken out the policies, Im 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that they would still have taken  
out the PPI had they been given clear, fair and not misleading information about  the policies 
they were buying.
So Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable  in those circumstances, to conclude 
Nationwide should  pay Mr and Mrs R compensation, as that would put them in a better 
position than they would  have been in if everything  had happened  as it should have done.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mr and Mrs Rs representative says a court  might  take 
if it were to find Nationwide  had been in breach of its duty of utmost  good faith. But this 
doesnt persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mr and Mrs R in a better position than if everything had happened as 
it should have  done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  6 November 2020.
