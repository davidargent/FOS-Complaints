Complaint
Miss S has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to her. She says the loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money provided Miss S with a total of four loans. 118 118 Money initially provided 
Miss S with a loan for £1,000.00 in September 2019. This loan had an APR of 99.9% and a 
term of 12 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of £1,401.60, including 
interest, fees and charges of £401.60, was due to be repaid in 12 monthly instalments of just 
under £116.80. This loan was settled in full in October 2019.
118 118 Money then provided Miss S with a second loan also for £1,000.00 in June 2020. 
This loan had an APR of 79.9% and a term of 12 months. This meant that the total amount 
to be repaid of £1,354.92, including interest, fees and charges of £354.92, was due to be 
repaid in 12 monthly instalments of £112.91. This loan was settled in full in December 2020.
In July 2021, 118 118 Money provided Miss S with a third loan for £1,300.00. This loan had 
an APR of 44.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£1,861.44, including interest, fees and charges of £561.44, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of £77.56. This loan was settled in full in October 2021.
Miss S was provided with a fourth and final loan for £2,000.00 in February 2022. This loan 
had an APR of 49.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £3,012.96, including interest, fees and charges of £1,012.96, was due to be repaid 
in 24 monthly instalments of £125.54. 
One of our investigators reviewed Miss S complaint and he concluded that 118 118 Money 
didnt do anything wrong when providing Miss S with her loans and so didnt recommend that 
the complaint be upheld. Miss S disagreed with the investigators assessment and asked for 
an ombudsmans decision.
My provisional decision of 14 August 2023
I issued a provisional decision  on 14 August 2023 - setting out why I intended to partially 
uphold Miss S complaint. I wont copy that decision in full, but I will instead provide a 
summary of my findings. 
I started by explaining that 118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice, what this means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to 
be able to understand whether Miss S could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money said it agreed to Miss S applications after she provided details of her 
monthly income and some information on her expenditure. It says it cross-checked this 
against information on a credit search it carried out and all of this information showed Miss S 
could afford to make the repayments she was committing to. On the other hand, Miss S said 
she couldnt afford these loans and so shouldnt have been lent to.
I carefully thought about what Miss S and 118 118 Money had said.
Loans 1 and 2
These were Miss S first loans with 118 118 Money. And 118 118 Money provided an output 
of the income and expenditure information recorded at the time of these applications as well 
as a record of the results of its credit searches.
118 118 Moneys searches appeared to show that Miss S commitments at the time were 
relatively well managed. At the application for loan 1 Miss S non-mortgage related debt 
wasnt too high. There were a number of credit searches carried out in the lead up to loan 1 
but there wasnt much in the way of other signs of difficulty. 
By the time of loan 2, Miss S non-mortgage related debt had reduced from what it was at 
the time she applied for loan 1. And the number of searches carried out in her name had 
also substantially reduced. That said, I was mindful that there were a couple of occasions 
where Miss S was slightly above her credit limit on revolving credit accounts and this was a 
second loan application. However, there was an eight-month break between loan 1 being 
repaid and loan 2 being provided and it wasnt for a larger amount either.  
Having taken all of this into account as well as the fact that these loans were for relatively 
small amounts taken over 12-month terms, I thought that 118 118 Moneys checks went far 
enough. And given the rest of the information gathered also suggested that Miss S could 
afford to make the payments to loans 1 and 2, I didnt think that it was unreasonable for         
118 118 Money to proceed with these applications.
I accepted that Miss S appeared to be suggesting that her actual circumstances werent fully 
reflected in the information 118 118 Money obtained at the respective times. But 118 118 
Money could only make reasonable decisions based on the information it had available at 
the time. 
As these were first loans and there wasnt anything to indicate that Miss S might have been 
experiencing financial difficulty at the respective times, I was satisfied that 118 118 Money 
was reasonably entitled to believe that Miss S could afford to make her payments. And this 
left me intending not to uphold the complaint about loans 1 and 2.
Loans 3 and 4
When Miss S approached 118 118 Money in July 2021 she was approaching for a third loan 
within the space of just over a year. This together with the fact that the amount borrowed 
was higher, the loan was being taken over a longer term, Miss S was even more indebted 
and had taken out a number of other loans in the period leading to this application all led me 
to think that 118 118 Money ought to have found out more about more about Miss S before 
determining that this loan was affordable for her. The position was even worse by the time of loan 4 as Miss S was taking out a loan for an 
even larger amount, approaching for a fourth loan within the space of less than two years 
and owed other creditors even more than she did at the time she was provided with loan 3. 
Having thought about all of this, I was satisfied that 118 118 Money ought reasonably to 
have carried out further checks before providing loans 3 and 4 to Miss S.
I thought further checks would have extended into finding out more about Miss S 
expenditure. And if 118 118 Money had done this here, I was persuaded that it would have 
seen that Miss S was already in a difficult financial position at the respective times and also 
found out why this was the case. I was also satisfied that reasonable and proportionate 
checks would more likely than not have shown 118 118 Money that Miss S existing 
precarious financial position was because she was struggling financially. 
So I was persuaded by what Miss S had said about already being in a difficult financial 
position at the respective times and the reasons for this. And as reasonable and 
proportionate checks should have extended into finding out more about Miss S income and 
expenditure, I was satisfied that they would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money 
that it shouldnt have provided loans 3 and 4 to Miss S. 
As 118 118 Money provided Miss S with loans 3 and 4, notwithstanding this, I was minded to 
conclude that it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Miss S ended up paying interest, fees and charges on loans she shouldnt have been 
provided with in the first place. So it was my intention to issue a final decision finding that   
Miss S lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong when providing loans 3 and 4 
and that it needed to put things right.
Responses to my provisional decision
Miss S confirmed that she accepted my provisional decision and didnt provide anything 
further to me to consider.
118 118 Money also confirmed it accepted my provisional decision and that it had nothing 
further to add. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I set out in some detail why I intended to uphold Miss S complaint in my provisional decision 
of 14 August 2023. As Ive not been provided with anything further by the parties to consider, 
Ive not been persuaded to alter my conclusions. 
So Im still upholding Miss S complaint and I remain satisfied that 118 118 Money needs to 
put things right. 
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Miss S
Having thought about everything, Im satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable for       
118 118 Money to put things right for Miss S by:
refunding all interest fees, and charges Miss S paid as a result of loans 3 and 4:adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Miss S to the date of settlement
removing any adverse information it may have recorded about loans 3 and 4 from       
Miss S credit file; 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision of 14 August 2023, Im 
upholding Miss S complaint. Madison CF UK Limited should put things right in the way Ive 
set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 September 2023.
