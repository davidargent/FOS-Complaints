K821x#15complaint
Mr L says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr L had 28 loans with QuickQuid, approved between  March 2010 and June 2013. Ive 
included some of the information QuickQuid provided about  these loans in the appendix to 
this decision. Mr Ls complaint  is about the loans numbered 15-28 but I may refer to earlier  
loans in my findings  when  necessary.
An adjudicator has looked at Mr Ls complaint and recommended it be upheld.  He thought 
that by the time of loan 15, QuickQuid ought to have realised that further lending wouldve 
been unsustainable or otherwise harmful for Mr L. QuickQuid didnt agree, so the complaint  
was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Ls case.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ls complaint about loans 15-28 and have explained  why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ls income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So, taking into account the short-term purpose  of the loans provided, Ive thought about 
whether the overall pattern of lending increased  Mr Ls indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Ref: DRN24942302With this is mind, Ive looked  at the pattern of lending in Mr Ls case  to see if there was a 
point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point had been reached by 
loan 15. (Its possible it was reached before this point, but those loans do not form part of 
this complaint.)
I think this point had been reached by loan 15 because:
the amounts  Mr L was borrowing were not generally decreasing,  and QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it was likely  he was not settling his debts sustainably
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed QuickQuid  he 
continued to borrow  similar amounts, without any significant break between his loans, 
for more  than three years
I think that Mr L lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 15 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ls complaint about  loan 15 and the subsequent loans because the 
overall pattern  of lending increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful and he lost out as a result.
Id like to make it clear I have considered the points  QuickQuid  raised  in response to the 
adjudicator. Essentially, it has said it doesnt think that a pattern of lending alone  is enough  
to establish that the loans were unsustainable  or otherwise harmful  for Mr L. In making its 
points, it referred to the current regulators sourcebook for consumer credit,  known as 
CONC.
But CONC isnt really  relevant to this complaint. CONC came  into force on 1 April 2014 and 
while Mr L did still have an outstanding balance with QuickQuid at this point, he hadnt  
borrowed anything from QuickQuid since August 2013. So no lending  took place under 
CONC. 
Ref: DRN24942303The regulator at the time the loans  were approved was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)  
which had provided  guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). As Ive mentioned above, this 
services approach to short-term lending is set out on our website, so I wont  cite all the 
relevant rules and regulations here.
The ILG says (at paragraph 6.25)  unfair and/or deceptive practices include:
Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's existing credit commitment  for a short-
term credit  product in a way that is unsustainable  or otherwise harmful.
And that this includes:
allowing a borrower to sequentially  enter into a number of separate agreements for 
short-term loan products, one after another, where the overall effect  is to increase  the 
borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable manner.
And that payday  loans:
are not appropriate for supporting sustained borrowing over longer  periods
The above is reflected on QuickQuids website, which  says:
Short-term loans should be used for short-term financial needs only,  and not as long-term 
financial solution. As a responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent use of our 
service.
With this (and our Services published  approach  and previous decisions) in mind I dont 
agree that a pattern of lending isnt, in some  circumstances, enough on its own to indicate 
that further lending would  be unsustainable  or otherwise harmful.  As I have  said, Mr L 
borrowed from QuickQuid with no significant break  for more than three years.  I dont think  
that can reasonably  be described as a short-term  relationship and at some point, QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it wasnt fair to continue lending to Mr L. For the reasons Ive given 
above, I think this point came at loan 15.
So Im upholding  Mr Ls complaint about  loan 15 and all subsequent loans.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr L paid on loan 15 and all subsequent loans
pay interest on the above  at 8% simple per year, from when they were  paid until the 
date of settlement
remove all entries about  the above  loans from Mr Ls credit file
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr L a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN24942304 my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2019.

Ref: DRN24942305Appendix
Loans 1-27 were payday  loans, most of which were repayable in a single payment. Loan 28 was 
an open-ended facility  known as a FlexCredit account. This allowed Mr L to make  drawdowns  
up to a fixed limit and then repay them in up to ten monthly instalments. Mr L made  seven 
drawdowns between  17/06/2013 and 13/08/2013 totalling  £1,140.
The complaint about loans  1-14 was withdrawn,  but I include them  here to provide  context for the 
loans Im considering.
