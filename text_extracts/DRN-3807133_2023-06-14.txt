The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid to a holiday company. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that Mr and Mrs H had bought holiday products in April 
2003 and in 2008 and were advised, in 2014, that they had to make a further purchase to 
stay protected. They entered into an enrolment agreement with a holiday company in August 
2014 under which they enrolled their existing week in the club programme in exchange for 
an allocation of points (which was shown on the inventory schedule as 6,000 points). They 
also agreed to pay an initial joining fee of £4,059. Mr and Mrs H entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of £4,059 to pay the initial joining fee and 
they agreed to make 60 monthly loan repayments of £92.55. 
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims to Shawbrook Bank under section 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 in January 2017. Shawbrook Bank responded to those claims 
and said that there was nothing on its, or the holiday companys, records which would 
suggest that Mr and Mrs H were in any way misled or pressured into making their purchase. 
It said that it did the appropriate checks and there were no issues with the lending and the 
account had never been in arrears. It said that no commission was payable to the holiday 
company for the brokering of credit and it was unable to agree that the points or the loan 
were mis-sold. Mr and Mrs H also wrote to Shawbrook Bank and made claims under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act. Mr and Mrs H werent satisfied with the response that theyd 
received from Shawbrook Bank so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form, which they signed in March 2017, says that: Shawbrook Bank failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Hs ability to afford the loan and paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs H; and the holiday 
company unduly pressured Mr and Mrs H into entering into the enrolment agreement and 
the loan agreement; all of which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
They provided another complaint form in May 2019 which said that they were persuaded to 
enrol in the club and were offered more choice by giving them points but they never received 
what they were promised. They say that they only received 5,000 points and their exchange 
wasnt initially recognised. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld as she 
didnt think that Shawbrook Banks decision to turn down their claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. She said that she hadnt been provided with any correspondence or any 
evidence to back up what Mr and Mrs H said about their points allocation and the exchange 
not being recognised so she wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the 
time of sale. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mr and Mrs H and Shawbrook Bank was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She didnt consider that Shawbrook 
Bank had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company. 
Mr and Mrs Hs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it used and has described its serious concerns about the 
way that the finance was sold to Mr and Mrs H. It has also provided further documentation 
about what it says is a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Hs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs H signed documents in August 2014, including the enrolment agreement, 
the terms and conditions, an inventory schedule, a separate standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given, a key information document, an exchange 
contract, the holiday companys customer compliance statement and declaration 
about treating customers fairly, a joint finance application, Shawbrook Banks 
customer compliance statement and the loan agreement;
they say that they were told after theyd returned home that the allocation of 6,000 
points was a mistake and they were only entitled to 5,000 points but that that would 
be ample points to book with  yet when they tried to book their usual holiday they 
were told that not only was there no availability but that it would take 20,000 points 
on average to book anything;
the inventory schedule identified Mr and Mrs Hs existing holiday product and 
referred to an allocation of 6,000 points  but it says that the information  is for 
guidance purposes only  and the club reserves the right to  modify points 
values allocated for a week to be deposited without prior written notice;
I can understand Mr and Mrs Hs disappointment and frustration that they were only 
allocated 5,000 points but theyve not provided any of their correspondence or other 
documentation with the holiday company about their points allocation being reduced 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company misrepresented the points allocation to them or that it has breached its 
contract with them;
Mr and Mrs Hs representatives January 2017 letter to Shawbrook Bank made 
claims about the way that the points were sold and misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H 
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the points were 
misrepresented to them or that they were induced into entering into the enrolment 
agreement by any misrepresentations made by the holiday company;Shawbrook Bank says that Mr and Mrs H secured reservations in the UK in October 
2015 and July 2016 and that the holiday company says that they havent contacted it 
at any time to request any assistance;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that Mr and Mrs H were pressured into enrolling 
in the programme but they signed the holiday companys compliance declaration to: 
 confirm that we have been treated courteously during the sales presentation, that 
we have been given plenty of time to consider if the product is right for us and we 
have not been put under any pressure to purchase [the points];
Shawbrook Bank says that the holiday companys records show that Mr and Mrs H 
received a verification call from its quality assurance team in August 2014 and they 
confirmed that they had the team's contact details and would contact it if they had 
any questions about the product  but that no questions or concerns appear to have 
been raised by them;
Mr and Mrs H had also signed the standard form of the withdrawal notice that could 
be given - it said that they had the right to withdraw from the enrolment agreement 
within 14 days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr 
and Mrs H contacted the holiday company during the withdrawal period to withdraw 
from the agreement;
the loan agreement clearly set out Mr and Mrs Hs right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement and they signed Shawbrook Banks compliance statement in which they 
confirmed that theyd received the withdrawal notice and that the holiday company 
had explained their right to withdraw from the agreements;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the enrolment agreement or loan agreement or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them  if they 
were concerned about the way that those agreements were sold to them, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have withdrawn from the agreements 
during the applicable withdrawal periods or to have referred to those issues during 
the verification call  Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about those 
issues until their representatives letter to Shawbrook Bank in January 2017, about 
two and a half years later;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that: no financial background checks were 
completed when arranging the loan; Mr and Mrs H werent given alternative product 
availability offers; the holiday company fabricated their financial circumstances, failed 
to carry out the correct and thorough risk assessment of their finances and failed to 
relay a factual assessment of their financial circumstances; and the loan agreement 
was arranged and entered into negligently;
Mr and Mrs H signed a joint finance application form in August 2014 and confirmed 
that Mr H was retired with an annual income of £18,000, that Mrs H worked part-time 
with an annual income of £15,000 and that they owned a property with no mortgage;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for them at that time 
and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank to conclude on the 
basis of the information that Mr and Mrs H had provided that they could sustainably 
afford a loan with monthly repayments of £92.55;
Mr and Mrs H agreed in Shawbrook Banks customer compliance statement that 
theyd had:  access to more than one lender to assist with the purchase of [their] 
Holiday Ownership Product ; and Im not persuaded that any further checks were 
required or that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company or 
Shawbrook Bank has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan or that it was mis-
sold to Mr and Mrs H;Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the holiday company accepted or arranged 
undisclosed commission for this arrangement unbeknown to Mr and Mrs H  but 
Shawbrook Bank says that no commission was payable to the holiday company for 
the brokering of credit;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that a commission was paid by 
Shawbrook Bank to the holiday company in connection with Mr and Mrs Hs loan 
agreement;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel 
about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it used and it says that theres 
been a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday company;
Ive carefully considered the submissions about the unfairness of the terms of the 
agreement and other documents that Mr and Mrs H signed in August 2014 and the 
breaches of regulations that have been described but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs H and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H and 
Shawbrook Bank;
nor am I persuaded that theres been a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday 
company as described by Mr and Mrs Hs representative;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Hs 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H 
and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs H for the issues that theyve have had with their points, 
but I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mr and Mrs Hs claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to 
refund to Mr and Mrs H any of the money that theyve paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 12 July 2023.
