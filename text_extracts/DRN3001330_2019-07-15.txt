K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him in an
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  5 July 2019,  
an extract  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.  So, I wont  repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I thought  that QuickQuid shouldnt  have given Mr F 
the final top up on loan three to loan 11. I set out what I proposed to ask QuickQuid  to do to 
put matters right. 
Mr F accepted my provisional decision and had nothing further to add. QuickQuid said it had 
nothing to add.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Mr F nor QuickQuid has provided  anything further in relation to the 
complaint, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional 
decision. So, I dont  think that QuickQuid should have given Mr F the final top up on loan 
three taken  on 16 January  2012 to loan 11 inclusive. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Fs complaint in 
part. CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading as QuickQuid should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid from and including  the final top up on loan 
three taken on 16 January  2012 to loan 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about the final top-up on loan three  and loans four, 
five, six, eight,  nine,  ten and 11 from Mr Fs credit file;
any information recorded about  loan seven is adverse. So all entries about loan 
seven should  be removed from Mr Fs credit file.
Ref: DRN30013302 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. 
QuickQuid must give Mr F a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2019

Mr F wants a refund of interest  and charges,  plus interest. He also wants negative  information 
about the loans removed from his credit file. Mr F has asked  for an apology in relation to 
QuickQuids handling of his complaint.
One of our adjudicators assessed Mr Fs complaint.  He thought that QuickQuid shouldnt have lent 
to Mr F after and including the fifth loan.  The adjudicator set out how he thought QuickQuid should  
put that right.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with the adjudicator but it offered to refund interest and charges on loans 
five to seven and remove entries about those loans from Mr Fs credit file. Mr F didnt accept 
QuickQuids offer.
As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr F could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into account  a 
number of different things, such  as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and the 
Ref: DRN30013304consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of a lending relationship, 
I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
    the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
    the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr F could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance and later the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without undue  difficulties  and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender should  
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing  
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
In relation to loans one, two and the first two amounts advanced in loan three, given what  was 
apparent about Mr Fs circumstances at the time and his history with QuickQuid at that point,  I dont 
think it would have been proportionate  for QuickQuid  to ask Mr F for the amount of information  
needed to show that the lending was unsustainable. There wasnt anything in the information  Mr F 
provided or the information  QuickQuid should  have  been  aware of which meant that it should  have 
looked further  into Mr Fs financial position at that stage.
Proportionate checks for the final top-up of loan three  and loans four, five, six and seven are likely  to 
have established a much fuller picture of Mr Fs financial position. I think  proportionate checks here 
wouldve meant  that QuickQuid took steps to look at Mr Fs actual financial  position. It didnt do that. 
But thats not the end of the matter, as I need to establish whether that would have made any 
difference here.
Ref: DRN30013305Based on what Ive seen, I think that proportionate checks before the final top-up of loan three in 
January 2013 would have  shown arrears on two credit card accounts. Thats an indication that Mr F 
wasnt managing to repay  what he already owed. Those arrears went  on to become  two defaults  on 
the credit card accounts  in early March 2013. Also,  Ive seen from Mr Fs bank statements  that before 
loan six he had another short-term loan with another lender. On balance, I think  that proportionate 
checks would have shown  that Mr F couldnt afford to repay the final top-up of loan three or loans  
four, five and six in a sustainable way.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of borrowing in this period  of borrowing. I think  that by loan 
seven, QuickQuid should  have seen  that further lending was unsustainable.  Thats because by loan 
seven, Mr F had been borrowing from QuickQuid  for almost  seven months. Mr F wasnt making any 
real inroads to the amount he owed  QuickQuid.  Mr F had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mr F lost out because  QuickQuid gave him loan seven because  it had the effect  of 
unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  
use over an extended period of time. So, in addition to the third top-up of loan three and loans four, 
five and six, Im also upholding the complaint  about loan seven.
There was a gap of almost  six months in Mr Fs borrowing from QuickQuid between loans seven - 
repaid in July 2013 - and loan eight   taken in January  2014.  I think that gap broke  the chain of 
borrowing. So, loan eight was the start of a new period of borrowing.
I think that its more likely  than not that proportionate checks before  loan eight taken  in January 
2014 would have shown  not only the defaults in March  2013 but also the debt arrangement 
scheme Mr F entered into in July 2013. In those circumstances, I think  its unlikely that Mr F 
wouldve been  able to meet his repayments for loan eight and any subsequent  loans in a 
sustainable way. So, I dont  think that QuickQuid should have  given Mr F loans  eight to 11 either.
In summary,  based on what Ive seen, I think that proportionate  checks  would have shown  that Mr F 
couldnt repay  the final top-up of loan three and loans four, five, six and seven in a sustainable  way. 
They would also have shown that Mr F was in a debt arrangement scheme before loan eight 
onwards. I dont think that QuickQuid should  have  given  Mr F the loans from and including the final 
top-up of loan three to loan 11.
Mr F has asked for an apology from QuickQuid in relation to its response to his complaint.  I
appreciate that Mr F felt that QuickQuid hadnt considered his complaint properly but I dont  think that 
its reply was such that I should direct it to apologise  to Mr F.
putting things right  what I intend  to direct QuickQuid to do
refund all interest and charges Mr F paid from and including the final top up on loan three 
taken on 16 January 2012 to loan 11.
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about the final top-up on loan three and loans four, five, six, 
eight, nine, ten and 11 from Mr Fs credit file;
any information recorded about loan seven is adverse.  So all entries about  loan seven 
should be removed from Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must 
give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
