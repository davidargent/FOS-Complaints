DRN-2984101
The complaint
Mr Ss complaint is about the delay in PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SA (PayPal) releasing the 
funds he received from selling an item online.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them in detail 
again here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
In summary, Mr S sold an item through an online platform on 15 January 2021. The buyer 
made a payment into Mr Ss PayPal account two days later. But Mr S was unable to access 
the funds until 26 April 2021. PayPal says it initially placed a hold on the payment for 
additional checks. But due to a technical issue, the funds werent made available to Mr S 
immediately after these checks were successfully completed. 
Our investigator thought PayPal needed to take further steps to put things right for Mr S. She 
asked PayPal to pay interest at 8% simple on the payment for the period Mr S was unable to 
access the funds. She also recommended £50 compensation to recognise the 
inconvenience Mr S experienced in trying to resolve the matter. 
PayPal disagreed with the investigators recommendations and asked for an ombudsmans 
final decision. In summary, it says it informed Mr S the delay in releasing the funds was due 
to a technical issue, and it was being investigated. It also believes its not liable to pay 
compensation and has highlighted the limitation of liability section of its User Agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Theres no dispute PayPal was satisfied with its additional checks and the hold on 
the payment Mr S received should have been removed once these checks were 
completed. PayPal also accepts it was a technical issue, which I understand it 
managed to resolve internally, that caused the delay in releasing the funds to Mr S. 
Ive carefully considered what PayPal has said about why it believes its not liable for 
any impact the delay in releasing the payment had on Mr S. I accept the term its 
highlighted in its User Agreement is intended to limit liability. While I dont need to 
make a wider finding here, I have considered the specific circumstances of Mr Ss 
case. Having done so, I dont think it would be fair to construe the term as applying in 
this situation in the way PayPal has suggested. The apparent intended application of 
the term would have a wide impact and not one I think Mr S would have accepted 
had he known or sufficiently understood the potential consequences and impact.
PayPal has relied on the one email it sent Mr S on 22 February 2021 as reason for 
why it believes it acted fairly in keeping him informed. But this email was sent over a 
month after problem arose. And after Mr S had already made several phone calls to 
PayPal to resolve the situation. In this email, PayPal says it will do its best to fix the 
technical issue as soon as possible. But I can see it took a further two months, and 
several chasers, before Mr S could access his funds. Given this, Im not persuaded 
PayPal did enough in keeping Mr S informed. 
Regardless of the notification of the reason for the delay, through no fault of his own, 
Mr S was deprived of funds that were rightfully his for over three months. 
I acknowledge there was a technical issue and PayPal was looking into it. But this 
isnt an insignificant length of time for someone to be left without access to money 
theyd been relying on. Its only fair PayPal adds interest on the amount Mr S 
received, for the period he didnt have the money he should have.
During this time, Mr S took steps to resolve the situation and did everything he could. 
Hes told us he contacted PayPal numerous times and spent several hours on the 
phone. When it was suggested the problem lay with the online platform, Mr S also 
made enquiries with that business. Mr S found his dealings with PayPal time-
consuming and distressing. Its only fair this is recognised. I consider £50 the 
investigator recommended is fair in the circumstances.
Putting things right
To resolve Mr Ss complaint, PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should:
pay Mr S simple interest at 8% per annum on the payment he received from the 
sale. PayPal needs to calculate this amount from 19 January 2021, the date Mr S 
should have been able to access the payment, till 26 April 2021, when he was finally 
able to access the funds.
Pay Mr S £50 compensation for the distress and inconvenience he experienced over 
the three-month period in trying resolve this matter.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to take off tax from this interest. PayPal must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie, SCA to put things right for Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
