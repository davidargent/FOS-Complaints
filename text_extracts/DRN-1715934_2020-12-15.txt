The complaint
Mrs T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) is pursuing her for 
repayment of an overdraft from a business she isnt involved with. She wants NatWest to 
contact her former business partner over the matter and there to be no impact on her credit 
rating.
What happened
Mrs T was a partner in a business (the Firm) with her husband, Mr T. The Firm opened an 
account with NatWest in 2015. Mrs T says she left the Firm in April 2017. She says she and 
Mr T called NatWest many times to advise it of this and each time it said it would send a 
form to remove her from the account, but it never arrived. Mrs T says she assumed it had 
been dealt with and she didnt see any correspondence from NatWest after this. Mrs and Mr 
T subsequently separated, and Mrs T changed address.
In September 2019 Mrs T was called by a debt collector seeking recovery of an overdraft on 
the account with NatWest but this overdraft was under a different business name. Mrs T said 
this was nothing to do with her as the account hadnt had an overdraft facility when she was 
involved. She complained saying the debt was nothing to do with her and it should speak to 
Mr T. 
NatWest said the Firm name on the account had been changed in October 2018. It said Mrs 
T was jointly liable for the debt with Mr T, as she was still party to the account. It couldnt find 
any calls from her requesting she be removed and said Mrs T appeared to accept the form 
to remove her had never been completed.  
Mrs T said NatWest was harassing her but wasnt contacting Mr T. She sent a copy of a text 
from Mr T confirming her name shouldnt be on the account. She said NatWest had acted on 
Mr Ts sole instruction to change the name of the account and to arrange the overdraft, 
which showed she wasnt involved. 
NatWest said the mandate allowed one partner to sign for all matters apart from the removal 
of a party from the account. It said the overdraft facility had been agreed in November 2017, 
but the account hadnt been in credit since April 2018 and became a concern in May 2019. It 
said it couldnt discuss matters relating to Mr T due to data protection requirements. 
Mrs T referred her complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold it. She said there 
was no evidence that Mrs T had requested to be removed from the account. There was 
confusion about what NatWests requirements were to remove a partner from an account 
and whether Mrs T could instruct this herself. NatWest said the mandate continued even if 
someone of them ceased to be a partner until a new mandate acceptable to it was put in 
place. 
Our investigator said under the terms and conditions (T&Cs) of the account Mrs T and Mr T 
were jointly and severally liable for any debt. This meant NatWest could approach each party 
separately to request full payment. She said the T&Cs allowed NatWest to seek recovery via 
a debt collection agency. And it didnt need to remove Mrs T from the mandate even if Mr T 
agreed to pay it until the debt was cleared.
Mrs T said NatWest should check its call records. She the debt wasnt hers as she was 
never involved with the business and it was Mr Ts liability and it should be pursing Mr T not 
her. 
Our investigator didnt change her view. She said NatWest couldnt locate any calls and only 
retained records for a certain period. And Mrs T hadnt been able to provide any evidence of 
when the calls took place. She said our service offered impartial dispute resolution and can 
only considered the evidence provided. 
As Mrs T doesnt agree it has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
I know my decision will be distressing for Mrs T and I have a great deal of sympathy for her 
situation. Mrs T has shown evidence that she advised HMRC she left the Firm in April 2017 
and the overdraft facility wasnt arranged until after then. But there isnt any evidence that 
she gave NatWest notice that she had left the Firm and she was never removed from the 
account.
The mandate allowed either of Mrs T or Mr T to place instructions, including changing the 
name of the Firm or authorising borrowing. It also made Mrs T jointly and severally liable for 
any debts of the Firm owed to NatWest. The terms of the mandate continue until it is 
revoked in writing by a partner or replaced by a new mandate. Mrs T didnt revoke the 
mandate in writing and says the form wasnt received.
NatWest said that releasing Mrs T from the mandate of the account wasnt automatic and:
it doesnt matter what Mrs T advised us of and whether she was an account 
signatory or not. If she was party to the overdraft, then she will remain liable until the 
bank agrees to release her.
But NatWest has agreed as there was no debt when Mrs T says she left, there would have 
been no reason for it not to release her, had it been requested. NatWest felt this was further 
evidence that the request hadnt been made.
Mrs T has confirmed that there wasnt a formal partnership agreement between her and Mr 
T. This means their Firm is subject to the provisions of the Partnership Act 1890. 
s36 of the Act sets out the rights of those dealing with the firm after its constitution has 
changed, such as a partner retiring or leaving. It says anyone dealing with the firm is entitled 
to treat all apparent members of the old firm as still being members of it until given notice of 
the change. 
It sets out what notice is required, which is an advertisement in the London Gazette and Mrs 
T doesnt appear to have given this notice.  NatWest hasnt located any calls from Mrs T or Mr T, and I wouldnt expect telephone 
records to be available so long after the event. Unfortunately, Mrs T hasnt been able to 
provide evidence of them herself. But overall here, without any evidence of calls being made 
in the way she says  its difficult for me to conclude, on balance, that NatWest was advised 
about this by Mrs T. 
This is very unfortunate for Mrs T. There was no debt when she left but there was also no 
reason for NatWest not to release her. The procedural steps required to do what Mrs T 
wanted  would have been either writing to revoke the mandate (which would have prompted 
NatWest to require a new mandate without Mrs T), completion of NatWests specific form, or 
giving notice under the law that she had left the Firm. But none of those were completed 
here. And NatWest provided the overdraft believing she was still involved.
So, under the terms of the mandate and taking into account the relevant law here - NatWest 
is entitled to seek recovery of the debt from Mrs T and I cant say its treating her unfairly or 
unreasonably in doing so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I that I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2021.
