The complaint
Mr K complains that Metro Bank PLC (Metro Bank) is refusing to refund him the amount he 
lost as the result of a scam.
Mr K is being represented by a third party. To keep things simple, I will refer to Mr K 
throughout my decision.
What happened.
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary, Mr K received cold calls from a business called 24 Options, also known as 
Rodeler (X), which started around June 2017. X explained investment opportunities to Mr K 
which Mr K initially declined to take part in.
Mr K did some online research into the investments X had described and decided they 
looked promising. When X called Mr K again later in the year he agreed to start investing.
X appeared very professional and experienced. It explained that Mr K had a dedicated 
account manager and directed him to its online trading platform which also looked very 
professional. Mr K opened an account on the platform having provided his personal 
identification documents and was able to login and navigate the platform as he would expect 
from any legitimate investment business.
Given the professional setup of X Mr K was comfortable that he was dealing with a legitimate 
business.
X told Mr K he would receive profits of two to three times what he was willing to invest, and 
that X would take a commission. X directed Mr K to make trades via the platform which he 
agreed to.
Mr K could see his investment was growing and during the time he invested with X he was 
able to make withdrawals which added to his confidence with X. Although in late 2019 Mr K 
had made a substantial profit and requested the withdrawal of his funds, but X persuaded Mr 
K to make another investment and all his funds were lost.
Mr K was no longer able to access the trading platform and realised he had fallen victim to a 
scam.
Mr K made payments into the scam via his account held with Metro Bank using his debit 
card, and another account he held at another bank.
Below is a table showing the payments Mr K made into the scam from his Metro Bank 
account, representing a total loss to Mr K of £34,350:

Our Investigator considered Mr Ks complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. Mr K 
disagreed so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has not been disputed that Mr K has fallen victim to a cruel scam. The evidence provided 
by both Mr K and Metro Bank sets out what happened. What is in dispute is whether Metro 
Bank should refund the money Mr K lost due to the scam.
Recovering the payments Mr K made
Mr K made payments into the scam via his debit card. When payments are made by card the 
only recovery option Metro Bank has is to request a chargeback.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.Unfortunately, Mr K made his complaint to Metro Bank outside of the allowed time to raise a 
chargeback and therefore Metrobank has been unable to attempt a chargeback for the 
payments Mr K made into the scam.
I have also considered whether Mr K should receive a refund for the payments he made into 
the scam under the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code. But the CRM code 
doesnt cover payments made by debit card so it would not apply.
With the above in mind, I dont think Metro Bank had any recovery options available to it for 
the payments Mr K made.
Should Metro Bank have reasonably prevented the payments Mr K made? 
It has been accepted that Mr K authorised the payments that were made from his account 
with Metro Bank, albeit on Xs instruction. So, the starting point here is that Mr K is 
responsible.
However, banks and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect 
against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large 
transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether Metro Bank should have been aware of the scam and stepped 
in and questioned Mr K about them. And if it had questioned Mr K would it have been able to 
prevent the scam taking place.
Mr K made two large payments of £10,000 each to X on 22 December 2017 which due to 
their value resulted in his card being stopped and a conversation between Mr K and Metro 
Bank taking place. A recording of this call is no longer available which isnt surprising given 
the time thats passed but I think its reasonable to assume the payments were discussed 
and that at the very least Mr K confirmed he had made the payments himself. 
I dont think that Metro Bank would have been aware at the time Mr K made the payments 
that he was falling victim to a scam. X was regulated in another country and had passporting 
rights to offer financial services to UK customers.
Warnings were available on IOSCO from 2013, 2014 and 2015. But all of these relate to the 
X offering financial services when it wasnt authorised or licensed to do so. And whilst that 
could be an indication of a scam, Im mindful X was regulated, had been since 2013, and 
had passporting rights into the UK since 2014, which it still held at the time of the payments.
The FCA also didnt publish a warning about X until 1 June 2020, which is after Mr K made 
the payments, therefore this warning would not have been available.
With the above in mind, I dont think it would have been reasonable for Metro Bank to have 
stopped the payments Mr K was attempting to make. But even if it did intervene, I am 
satisfied Mr K would have continued with the investment. I say this because I think Mr K had 
complete trust in the scam that was presented to him, he has told us how persuasive and 
credible X appeared to be and that it had built confidence with him over the months leading 
up to the payments being made.
So, Metro Bank is not responsible for Mr Ks loss.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2023.
