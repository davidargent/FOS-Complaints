The complaint
Mr N is unhappy American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) trading as American 
Express havent awarded his credit card account with the correct amount of points when he 
used their referral scheme.
What happened
In November 2021, Mr N contacted AESEL to find out the maximum amount of membership 
reward points he could earn in a calendar year, as a result of referring his friends and family 
to take out a credit card with AESEL. Mr N was told the maximum reward points he could 
earn through their referral scheme was 150,000 a year. Mr N said he had 85,000 points 
already through recommending friends and family and so had 65,000 left to earn before he 
reached the cap of 150,000. Mr N referred three people he knew to AESEL and says that he 
should have got 18,000 points per person he referred. So, Mr N says he should have 
received another 54,000 points in total. But he didnt receive this and told us that he thinks 
he received around 6,000 points instead.
AESEL looked into Mr Ns complaint. They said Mr N was told the incorrect information when 
he contacted them in November 2021. AESEL pointed to their terms and conditions for their 
referral programme which explained the maximum amount of bonus points that can be 
earned in a year is 90,000. AESEL apologised for the incorrect information Mr N was given 
and applied 12,500 membership reward points to Mr Ns credit card account as an apology.
Mr N says AESEL should honour the 54,000 points he feels he should have got for referring 
the three people.
Our Investigator agreed that Mr N had been given the incorrect information when he 
contacted AESEL. And that had Mr N been given the right information, its more likely than 
not that he would have waited until the following year, 2022, to refer the three people he did 
in order to benefit from the bonus points. So, our Investigator asked AESEL to credit the 
points he should have received, minus the 12,500, to Mr Ns 2022 membership reward 
points limit. 
Mr N replied in April 2022 and said hed already received the maximum 90,000 reward points 
as a result of referring people to open an AESEL account in 2022 already. So, what our 
Investigator recommended wasnt possible as Mr N had already reached the 90,000 points 
cap for 2022. 
Our Investigator looked into things again said there had been a loss of expectation as a 
result of Mr N being given the wrong information. So, instead of crediting his account with 
the points as previously suggested, our Investigator asked AESEL to pay Mr N £100 
compensation, in addition to the 12,500 points they applied to his credit card account.
Mr N didnt accept our Investigators view and said he wouldnt accept anything less than 
£250 to resolve his complaint. AESEL also replied and said the 12,500 points they credited 
Mr Ns account with was equal to £50. And they felt this fairly compensated Mr N for the 
incorrect information he was given. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mr Ns complaint is that he was given the incorrect information by AESEL and 
was told the cap was 150,000 membership reward points in any calendar year. Although Mr 
N says he already received 85,000 points from referring other friends and family, he wants 
AESEL to give him the 54,000 points he says he should have got from referring three more 
people. 
Its not in dispute that Mr N was told incorrectly that the cap was 150,000 when he contacted 
AESEL in November 2021 to ask specifically what the cap was. So, its clear something went 
wrong here. What Ill go on to decide is if theres any detriment caused to Mr N and whether 
AESEL have done enough to put things right for him.
Ive looked at the terms and conditions for the referral programme AESEL offer. And I can 
see they set out that the programme rewards card members who refer friends and family to 
apply for an account with AESEL. However, theres certain conditions that apply such as the 
type of card being applied for and also the card held by the card member. In some cases, 
both the card member and those that the card member refer to open an account with AESEL 
can be rewarded with bonus points.
The terms and conditions go on to explain how the referral can be done and also what the 
eligibility criteria is. Ive then gone on to read that card members, with the type of credit card 
Mr N has, can receive up to 90,000 bonus points a year through the referral scheme and that 
this is the annual bonus cap. So, I think the terms and conditions set out clearly that the 
amount of bonus points Mr N can receive through the referral scheme with the type of credit 
card he has is 90,000.
However, I dont find it unreasonable that Mr N relied on the information he was told over the 
phone in November 2021  that in fact, he could receive 150,000 points in a year. So, I dont 
think Mr Ns actions, when referring three more people to take out an account with AESEL 
following this information, was surprising.
AESEL have credited Mr Ns account with 12,500 points in recognition of the incorrect 
information he was given and theyve explained this equates to £50. However, Mr N feels 
AESEL should honour the 54,000 points he says he ought to have got when he referred 
three people to apply for an account with AESEL.
Our service generally wont require financial businesses to make incorrect information true  
instead, wed look at the impact thats had. I understand Mr Ns frustrations in being told the 
incorrect information and not receiving the amount of points he feels he should have got. 
However, as the cap for the points is 90,000, Mr N wasnt ever entitled to more than that, so 
I cant require AESEL to credit those points. 
In saying that though, I do think compensation is fair here. This is because Mr Ns 
expectations werent managed correctly when he was told the cap was 150,000 and as a 
result, I think Mr N has lost out. I can also understand Mr Ns frustration and upset when he 
didnt receive the 54,000 points. So, with that in mind, I agree with our Investigators 
recommendation that £100 compensation, in addition to the 12,500 points AESEL have 
credited Mr Ns account with, is fair in the circumstances. 
I can see from the information AESEL have provided us with that Mr N was credited with 
6,000 points on 6 November 2021 which I think on balance, is the 6,000 points Mr N has said he thinks he received in this complaint. But Mr N told us he had already received 85,000 
points from AESEL in 2021 before making the referrals. So, it may be that AESEL credited 
Mr N more than he was entitled to when the three referrals were made. But, in any case, that 
was a decision for AESEL to have made - I remain satisfied AESELs credit of a further 
12,500 points, plus my recommendation of £100 compensation is fair to put matters right.
My final decision
For reasons explained above, I uphold this complaint and I require American Express 
Services Europe Limited (AESEL) trading as American Express to pay Mr N £100 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2022.
