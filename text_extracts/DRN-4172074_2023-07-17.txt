The complaint
Mr B complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) didnt refund the money he lost in a 
scam.
What happened
Mr B says he met someone Ill refer to in this decision as N on a social networking site. Ns 
page showed he was making a lot of income online through drop shipping. Mr B messaged 
N who asked him about his goals and told Mr B he could mentor him and help him to make 
money online too. 
Mr B says he initially agreed to pay £500, in instalments, for a six-week course about drop 
shipping. He was added to a messaging app group and sent a 24-page online money 
making secrets guide. N also spoke to Mr B daily and provided him with advice about setting 
up a website and advertising. Later, N suggested meeting and Mr B says they met up 
around ten times. N charged Mr B fees for meeting him as a mentor (£1,000) but Mr B says 
that when they met, they only discussed drop shipping for brief periods and then went to 
clubs. Mr B says he also invested in Ns business. He was told that if he promoted Ns 
courses, hed get a 15% cut but would need to pay N £3,000 to become an affiliate. This 
business didnt do well, and Mr B says that although N promised to return his money this 
didnt happen. 
N stopped responding to Mr Bs messages and later blocked contact with him. Mr B 
contacted Barclays at the end of August 2022 to say that hed been scammed.
Below is a table which shows the payments Mr B made to N.

Barclays said Mr B had a civil dispute with N and that the Lending Standards Board 
Contingent Reimbursement Model Code (CRM Code) doesnt apply to civil disputes.
Mr B was unhappy with Barclays response and brought a complaint to our service.
Our investigation so far 
The investigator who considered this complaint didnt recommend that it be upheld. She said 
Mr B has a civil dispute with N and the CRM Code doesnt apply to civil disputes. This was 
because Mr B paid for services, some of which he received, and there was no evidence that 
N intended to defraud Mr B.
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators findings and asked for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where evidence is unclear or in dispute, I reach my findings on the balance of probabilities  
in other words on what I consider most likely to have happened based on the evidence 
available and the surrounding circumstances. 
Im sorry to hear that Mr B has lost money. Under the CRM Code, the starting principle is 
that a firm should reimburse a customer who is the victim of an APP scam (except in limited 
circumstances). But the CRM Code is quite explicit that it doesnt apply to all push 
payments. It says: This Code does not apply to: (b) private civil disputes, such as where a Customer has paid 
a legitimate supplier for goods, services, or digital content but has not received them, they 
are defective in some way, or the Customer is otherwise dissatisfied with the supplier. 
So the CRM Code isnt a general protection for consumers. Instead, it only applies in very 
specific circumstances  where the customer has been the victim of a scam. In order for me 
to conclude that Mr B has been the victim of a scam, Id have to be satisfied that N 
deliberately tricked Mr B into making payments for a service/services he had no intention of 
providing at the time he made his payments. Im not persuaded I can say that is most likely 
what happened here and will explain why.
Its clear from the messages Mr B has shared that N did provide him with a service. Mr B 
was asked to set out his goals and said he wanted to make serious money. N provided Mr 
B with a 24-page online money secrets document that was described as a Secret Guide to 
Quitting Your Job and Becoming Free on 21 February 2022. Im satisfied from the 
messages Ive seen that Mr B was happy with the information provided. He then had a call 
with N, after which he said he was definitely going to join, and a further call was arranged to 
discuss payment. After this Mr B had regular calls and online meetings with N and discussed 
with him creating a profile, getting more followers, setting up a channel, posting videos and 
advertising. Mr B also referred to placing orders, but Im uncertain what for. Mr B then 
started to meet N from around 25 March 2022. 
There were numerous audio messages between Mr B and N, as well as regular written 
messages. I only have access to the written messages, but here is no suggestion that Mr B 
didnt receive what he was expecting to. And its clear Mr B met N on a number of occasions, 
which leads me to question why he would continue to pay substantial sums of money to 
meet N if he wasnt gaining much benefit from it, and to conclude that its more likely than 
not Mr B received the service he paid for. I can also see that some of the payments to N 
relate to expenses on nights out theyve had together. And the references for the payments 
also identify that Mr B was paying for specific services like a website, consultation and 
mentoring. If Mr B is now unhappy with what he received from N this is a civil matter that 
doesnt involve Barclays. 
Mr B has said he invested in Ns business, but the business didnt do well, and N agreed to 
give him the money back. There is no guarantee of making a profit when an investment of 
this nature is made though and the fact that Mr B didnt earn a profit doesnt mean he was 
scammed by N. Again, I think this aspect of the complaint relates to a civil dispute. 
Mr B has questioned why Barclays tried to recover his funds if he wasnt the victim of a 
scam. When scams are reported banks have an obligation to try to recover funds as quickly 
as possible. So Barclays contacted the bank that received Mr Bs funds before it completed 
its own investigation  when it concluded that Mr B wasnt the victim of a scam. The 
receiving bank said £0.07 remained in the account and when Barclays completed its 
investigation it said it would return this sum to the receiving bank. I think Barclays acted 
reasonably in reporting the matter to Ns bank as soon as possible. 
Overall, I consider Barclays acted fairly in concluding that Mr B has a civil dispute with N 
which is not covered by the CRM Code. 
My final decision
For the reasons stated above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2023.
