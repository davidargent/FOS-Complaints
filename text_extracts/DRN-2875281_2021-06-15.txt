The complaint
Mr L says HSBC UK Bank Plc has not properly compensated him for a mis-sold payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
In 2020 Mr L complained to HSBC about the sale of a PPI policy attached to a loan he took 
out in 1988.
In 1988 Mr L took out a loan for £5,000 to be repaid over 60 months. At the same time he 
was sold a PPI policy. The PPI was funded by a single premium of £520 which was added to 
the loan. The addition of the PPI meant that Mr Ls loan repayments were £13.00 per month 
higher than they would have been without the PPI.
Following this services involvement HSBC agreed to uphold Mr Ls complaint. 
HSBC wrote to Mr L on 18 March 2020. HSBC offered Mr L a total of £2,358.74. This was 
made up of:
£779.87 return of the PPI premium and interest paid by Mr L.
£1,578.87 compensatory interest (net of tax) for the time Mr L had been out of pocket.
The letter also informed Mr L that £394.72 tax had been deducted from the compensatory 
interest.
Mr L accepted the offer but it wasnt paid until May 2020. HSBC had updated the 
compensatory interest and paid Mr L £2,380.35.
As the offer letter and payment of the compensation straddled  the beginning of a new tax 
year, Mr L contacted HSBC to ask in which tax-year the tax had been deducted. He needed 
this information to complete his tax return accurately.
Mr L didnt receive a reply from HSBC so he contacted this service again.
HSBC confirmed the tax had been deducted and paid in the tax year 2020/21. And in 
December 2020 it sent Mr L a letter clarifying the tax paid. It then sent another letter in 
February 2021 again setting out the figures for the compensation paid.
The format of the calculations in these letters were slightly different and confusing. 
Our adjudicator recommended that HSBC pay Mr L an additional £150 compensation for the 
trouble and upset he experienced due to delays in answering his correspondence and for the 
confusion over the letters sent to him.
Mr L accepted the offer of £150 but he pointed out that HSBC had calculated compensatory 
interest at 8% simple for the whole time hed been out of pocket. Mr L said HSBC should 
have calculated compensatory interest at 15% before April 1993.
HSBC said it had calculated compensation at 15% before April 1993 and our adjudicator 
agreed. 
Mr L sent a copy of his own calculations which he said proved HSBC had used only 8% 
throughout.
The complaint was then passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HSBC has agreed the PPI was mis-sold to Mr L. And it has agreed to pay compensation. 
HSBC has also agreed to pay Mr L £150 for the trouble and upset he experienced due to 
delays and the confusing letters it sent Mr L. And I think that is fair. 
So the only outstanding issue is whether HSBC calculated compensatory interest at 15% 
simple before April 1993 or whether it used 8% simple for the whole time Mr L was out of 
pocket.
When a PPI is mis-sold Id expect a business to refund everything the consumer paid for the 
PPI. And Id expect it to pay compensatory interest for the time the consumer has not had 
use of the money. This should be calculated from the time the consumer paid the money to 
the time they get it back.
Mr L is correct when he points out that the usual rate of interest this service would expect a 
business to use is 15% simple before April 1993 and 8% simple afterwards.
I can see that in all HSBCs letters to Mr L it referred to the compensatory interest as having 
been calculated at 8%. And when Mr L made his own calculations based on the information 
contained in the March 2020 letter it does appear that 8% has been used. So I can 
understand why Mr L would have concerns that HSBC didnt use 15% before April 1993.
But there is a slight flaw in the way Mr L made his own calculations.
Mr L has used the total cost of the PPI (£779.87) and calculated 8% simple from 1988 to the 
date of the March 2020 letter.
But Mr L did not pay £779.87 all at once in 1988. He repaid the loan over 60 months. 
The PPI cost him and extra £13.00 a month over 60 months. This is the amount he was out 
of pocket by each month.
Mr Ls loan began in August 1988 and he made his first repayment then, so he was only out 
of pocket by £13.00 at that point. So HSBC needed to refund him £13.00 from August 1988 
plus 15% until April 1993 and 8% thereafter until he received the £13.00 back. 
It then needed to do the same for the payment made in September 1988 and so on.
So Mr L would not have been out of pocket for the full £779.87 until the loan and the PPI had 
been fully repaid in August 1993.We asked HSBC to show us evidence that it had used 15% simple interest on the PPI 
premiums Mr L paid. 
HSBC didnt have a copy of the original calculation but it reran the calculations and has 
shown us it used 15% on each £13.00 Mr L paid up to April 1993 and 8% simple thereafter. 
Ive seen a copy of the full calculation and I am satisfied HSBC has used the correct 
percentages and dates.  
The new calculation produced a total net compensation figure of £2,329.00 which is around 
£50.00 less than the figure Mr L received. But HSBC has said it happy to honour the original 
offer it paid to Mr L.
In summary I am satisfied HSBC has calculated and paid Mr L fair compensation in line with 
the way Id expect. In particular I am satisfied it has used 15% simple before April 1993 and 
8% simple after April 1993 to calculate compensatory interest.
I am also satisfied that £150 is fair compensation for the trouble and upset Mr L experienced 
due to HSBCs delays and confusing correspondence.     
My final decision
My final decision is that HSBC UK Bank Plcs has calculated and paid Mr L fair 
compensation for the mis-sale of the PPI.
HSBC UK Bank Plcs offer of £150 for trouble and upset experienced by Mr L is also fair, 
HSBC UK Bank Plcs should make this payment to Mr L if it has not already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2021.
