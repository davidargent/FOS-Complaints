The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont refund him the funds he 
lost in a scam. 
What happened
What Mr P says
Mr P says he was in contact with someone Ill call K online. They had sent messages for 
around a week before K asked Mr P to lend her some money and allow her remote access 
on his phone through an app. Mr P says he agreed to lend K less than £100 and to give K 
remote access. He has explained that because of a health condition he tends to trust what 
hes told and follow instructions. The payment was going to be sent by different means but 
as this wasnt successful Mr P agreed that the funds could be taken using PayPal. But K 
took more than USD 1,300 without Mr Ps knowledge. When he found out Mr P contacted 
PayPal to raise a dispute, saying the transactions were unauthorised.  
I have set out below the activity on Mr Ps account.

Mr P says that when K became aware that hed raised a dispute she was unhappy and 
blackmailed him  saying she had his fathers phone number and would tell him about what 
shed seen on Mr Ps phone. As a result, Mr P asked PayPal to cancel the dispute and return 
the funds to K. But as K didnt pay Mr P back, he later contacted PayPal again and told it 
what had happened, including the fact hed been blackmailed. He would like PayPal to return 
the funds he lost. 
What PayPal say
PayPal say the payments were authorised by Mr P and that its buyer protection didnt apply 
because Mr P had selected the Personal Payment option, which is meant for payments to 
friends and family only. PayPal concluded it had followed its procedures and that as Mr P 
allowed remote access to his account, hed breached its user agreement. 
PayPal hasnt provided any information about the receiving PayPal account or the steps it 
took to recover Mr Ps funds. 
Our investigation so far
The investigator who considered this complaint didnt uphold it. She said Mr P had allowed K 
access to his PayPal account and so was liable for the transactions she made and that he 
authorised the payments because he knew at least one payment was being made. The 
investigator noted the payments wouldnt have flagged as unusual given the relatively low 
value of them and even though some payments to K were cancelled or refused there can be 
good reason for this. In any event, in the investigators opinion, a discussion with Mr P was 
unlikely to have made a difference given the influence K had over him and the fact she was 
blackmailing him. 
In relation to recovery of Mr Ps funds, the investigator said Mr P cancelled his first claim and 
asked for funds to be returned. The second claim was raised four days after the payment 
was made and after K knew about the first claim  so in all probability shed have removed 
the funds by the time the second claim was raised. 
Mr P didnt accept what the investigator said and asked for an ombudsman to review his 
complaint, so its been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant
law; guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to
have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
Authorisation
Generally, PayPal can hold Mr P liable for the disputed payments if the evidence suggests
that he most likely made or authorised them himself. In certain circumstances  including 
where Mr P has given authority to act on his behalf - payments by a third party (K in this 
case) can be considered to be authorised. This is the case even if Mr P didnt know about 
the payments or ask the third party to make them. This is the concept of apparent authority. 
So if Mr P allowed K access to his account, then payments made by K would look like they 
have been authorised by Mr P, Essentially, he held K out as having authority to make 
transactions on his account. In this situation, PayPal may be entitled to hold him liable. Mr P 
doesnt need to have given his explicit permission on every occasion or known the exact 
amount of each payment.
In Mr Ps case, I need to consider whether he played any part in allowing the transactions
which he now disputes. In other words, did he do anything which could be said to have
allowed another person to have his authority to make payments? Mr P has accepted he 
gave K remote access to make a payment. Whilst he didnt expect K to take as much as she 
did, Im persuaded that in doing so Mr P consented to and authorised the payments K made. 
I appreciate this will be very disappointing to Mr P, but Im afraid it means I cant reasonably 
ask PayPal to refund his loss. 
PayPal terms and conditionsIve also considered the terms of PayPals user agreement, which require its customers to 
keep their PayPal ID and/or password/PIN safe. Mr P gave K access to his account and his 
PayPal ID  meaning he also breached the terms of his user agreement with PayPal.  
Could PayPal have done more to prevent the payments?
PayPal has a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care, to follow good industry
practice and take steps to keep the customers accounts safe.
As a matter of good industry practice at the time, I consider PayPal should have taken
proactive steps to look to identify and help prevent transactions  particularly unusual or out
of character transactions  that could involve fraud or be the result of a scam.
In this case, I need to decide whether PayPal acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with
Mr P, or whether it should have done more than it did. Although I appreciate the payments 
Mr P made were significant to him, they werent for large sums and I wouldnt have expected 
PayPal to flag them as unusual or ask Mr P any questions about them. 
Given my finding that PayPal acted reasonably in processing the payment without taking any 
additional steps its not necessary for me to consider whether asking Mr P questions would 
have made a difference in this case. 
Did PayPal do enough to recover Mr Ps funds?
Ive considered whether PayPal did enough to try to recover Mr Ps money from K. It would 
have been helpful if PayPal had provided information about the steps it took to recover these 
funds and when funds left Ks account, but this hasnt been provided. In the circumstances, I 
need to consider what I think is most likely to have happened. 
The transactions took place on 15 July 2020 and he raised a dispute soon after. The 
messages Mr P exchanged with K suggest that money was removed from Ks account after 
he raised the dispute. But on 18 July 2020 Mr P contacted PayPal and asked it to cancel the 
dispute saying, it has now been dealt with. He also asked for the money to be returned to 
K, which is what seems to have happened. 
By the time Mr P contacted PayPal again and reported the full details of the scam, K was on 
notice that Mr P would take action to recover his funds if she didnt repay them and four days 
had passed since the transactions were made. Ive also seen that K told Mr P that shed 
closed her account after the transactions were made so any balance would have been 
removed when the account was closed. In the circumstances, I dont consider PayPal would 
have been able to recover any funds. Fraudsters usually remove funds immediately to avoid 
the possibility of funds being claimed. On balance, I think this is most likely what would have 
happened in this case. Ive also seen a screenshot of a message Mr P received from PayPal 
on 19 July 2020 which says it was unable to provide a refund on the transactions Mr P 
made, showing that no funds remained at this stage. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have explained above I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
