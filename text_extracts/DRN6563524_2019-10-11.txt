Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given to Mr M. Sunny  disagreed so the complaint was passed  to me for 
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN65635242But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, she didnt think there was anything to suggest that lending 
Mr M loans  1  5 was unreasonable.  And I agreed with the adjudicator. Sunny said that it 
had completed a credit check  when  agreeing  the first loan and looking at Mr Ms credit file, at 
that point in time I can see that a default  was present. But as that was recorded in April 2014 
and was showing as settled by November 2014, I think  it was reasonable for Sunny to have  
thought that Mr Ms circumstances  had improved, especially as the income  and expenditure 
information Mr M provided when applying for the loans indicated that he would be able to 
afford to repay the loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN65635243Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
Loan 6. I say this because:
By this point Mr M had already taken  out 5 loans  in under 3 months,  and loan 6 was 
the third time that Mr M had applied  for a loan where hed not yet repaid the existing 
loan. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr M was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole left in his finances caused by repaying his previous 
loan and that Mr Ms indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
The amounts  Mr M was borrowing were creeping up. For example the first loan was 
for £300 but loan 6 (which was taken out when  loan 5 was still outstanding) took 
Mr Ms total borrowing  up to £400.   At this point Sunny ought to have known that 
Mr M was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
By loan 6 there was a clear  pattern  of Mr M being provided  with a new loan within  
days of settling a previous  one, or when  a previous  one was still running. And Mr M 
had up to 6 months to repay each loan.  So Mr M was, in effect, put into the position 
whereby he would potentially be servicing a debt to Sunny over an extended  period  
of time.
So I think that Mr M lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to repeatedly take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended 
period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr M borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
In its response to our adjudicators view, Sunny explained it had carried  out checks on 
Mr Ms eligibility, affordability and credit worthiness. It said it had only ever given Mr M a 
small amount of credit relative to his income. It also pointed out that Mr M repaid a number 
of his loans early, arguing that this shows good loan management and that his actions were 
consistent with many of its customers who often  use the loans like an overdraft. But these 
points dont change  my thoughts on this case. 
As outlined  above,  Sunny  was required to do more than check  Mr M could afford each 
individual loan on a strict pounds and pence  basis. It had to ensure Mr Ms borrowing was 
sustainably affordable, and from loan 6 onwards the pattern of Mr Ms borrowing did not 
suggest this was the case. Rather, it seems it was unfairly extending  his use of high cost 
short term credit.
And with regards to the point about Mr Ms repayment behaviour it might,  in some  
circumstances, be reasonable to conclude that the early repayment of a loan indicates an 
improvement in a consumers financial  circumstances. But I disagree that was the case here.  
Ref: DRN65635244I think Sunny  wouldve  needed  more information about Mr Ms financial situation to 
reasonably conclude that he was not struggling  financially, given the high frequency  of 
concurrent borrowing  that took place.  I think a more reasonable conclusion would have been 
that he was most likely making  early repayments  by borrowing elsewhere, thereby 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably. I say this particularly as the gaps between Mr M 
repaying all of his outstanding  loans  and then applying for further  loans with Sunny were 
small.
I am therefore upholding the complaint about  loans 6 onwards. So Sunny will need to put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on Loans 6 - 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6  16 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put matters right by doing what I have  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
