The complaint
Miss B complains that Morses Club PLC lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Miss B has been a customer of Morses, or the companies Morses took over in the past, for 
many years. In all Miss B complains about 23 loans. Most of our adjudicators detailed table 
of the loans is duplicated here. Those loans which were approved before 6 April 2007 (loans 
1 to 10) we are not able to look at. 
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Highest 
Repayment
Loans 1 to 10 were all approved before 6 April 2007 and so pre-date the Financial 
Ombudsman Service jurisdiction over consumer credit providers.
Loans 11 to 15 were loans issued by a different company. Morses took over the 
administration of these loans in late January 2009 but did not take on the liability for the 
approval decisions of those earlier loans.

Our adjudicator explained that loans 1 to 10 were before the Financial Ombudsman had 
jurisdiction over lending of this kind and we were not able to consider them.
And the loans approved for Miss B by another company  loans 11 to 15 - were issued by 
London Scottish Finance Limited which had taken on the trading name Morses Club and 
started approving loans, up until that business entered administration in December 2008. 
Morses Club Limited was then incorporated in January 2009 and which later became Morses 
Club Plc. It has confirmed there wasnt any transfer of liability in relation to those earlier 
loans. When considering complaints, we take them into consideration as Morses wouldve 
known about the earlier loans before approving any new ones after 29 January 2009, but we 
dont give a view on them as they were a different business responsibility.
Considering all the above, the first loan our adjudicator looked at as part of his investigation 
into Miss Bs complaint was loan 16, approved 23 October 2009.
Our adjudicator referred to the gaps in the lending between loans 15 and 16 and loans 16 
and 17 and said that they were large enough gaps to break the loan chain meaning that we 
would look at what Morses did for loan 16 and for loan 17 as if each was the start of a new 
lending relationship. 
Our adjudicator explained to Miss B, twice, that he did not have enough information about 
her financial circumstances for the loan approvals for loans 16 to 21 to come to any 
alternative conclusions than non-upholds.  
Our adjudicator did think that by loan 22 Morses ought to have ceased lending to Miss B and 
so he considered that Morses should put things right for Miss B for loans 22 and 23. 
Miss B did not seem to question the points our adjudicator made about loans 1 to 15. And 
her response was that if Morses had carried out what she considered to have been proper 
checks then I do not believe loans 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 would have been approved.  
And from this it seems that Miss B was content with the outcome for loans 16 and 17. 
After I had reviewed the complaint I noticed that the loans in dispute  18 to 21  were all 
approved for Miss B in 2011. I have asked Miss B several times for copy bank statements for 
2011 to be sent to us. Nothing has been received. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. 
The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint. 
Information requests
When the complaint was first allocated to me I reviewed all the information from both parties. 
And I realised from Miss Bs response to our adjudicators view that the disputed loans so far 
as she was concerned were loans 18 to 21 all of which were approved for Miss B in 2011. 
Despite having a great deal of useful information from Miss B, we had no information or copy 
bank statements at all from 2011. So, I asked the adjudicator to explain this and informed 
Miss B that we would need those copy bank statements for 2011. The first reply date 
deadline for her was 27 April 2022 and Miss B responded to say she was getting the copy 
statements from her bank. The second reply deadline was 9 May 2022. 
Miss B sent some copies for 2012 which was not what I had needed to review her 2011 
loans. Then Miss B explained that the 2011 set was being sent to her by her bank. We 
accommodated her with the banks 12 to 16 working day timeline and still nothing has been 
received and no explanation from Miss B has been given to us about the 2011 statements.
In the interests of fairness to both parties I have decided that I am moving this complaint 
forward. This complaint was first referred to us in April 2021 and so it is thirteen months old. 
Having first requested copy bank statements for 2011 from Miss B on 13 April 2022, and 
today is 17 June 2022, then I have decided to proceed to issue my decision.  
Current position
We have not been able to look at loans 1 to 15 and Miss B appears to have understood that. 
Our adjudicator did not uphold Loans 16 and 17 and Miss B does not appear to have 
questioned that. She does ask that the outcome for loans 18 to 21 are reviewed. Loans 22 
and 23 were upheld by our adjudicator. 
As I have already indicated, without any further information from Miss B about her financial 
position for the period covering loans 18 to 21  - approved in 2011 - then I am proceeding on 
the information I have from Morses. 
I can see that Morses carried out proportionate checks and I would not have expected 
Morses to do more. I do not uphold the complaint for loans 18 to 21. 
Our adjudicator did think that Morses should put things right for loans 22 and 23. I have 
reviewed those. I have also looked at the overall pattern of Morses lending history with 
Miss B with a view to seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses ought to have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 22, and 
I say this because:
Miss B was provided with a new loan immediately after loan 22 was repaid. And 
Miss B had been borrowing from Morses consecutively and with no breaks from 
December 2010. 
So, I think that Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not she was 
having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed. Loan 23 was taken 
out almost four years after the first one in the lending chain (loan 17 onwards) and it 
was for £1,000 whereas loan 17 had been for £700. Miss B had paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Morses over an extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing from loan 22 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on her ability 
to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about loans 22 and 23 and Morses should put things right.
Putting things right  what Morses needs to do
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Miss B from loan 22, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss B may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable 
option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was 
even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or ought 
to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is impossible to now 
accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly 
conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to 
lend to Miss B in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable to 
conclude that Miss B would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. So, it 
wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has done 
wrong and should put right.Morses shouldnt have given Miss B loans 22 or 23.
A)Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss B towards interest, 
fees, and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything Morses have already refunded.
B)Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss B 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Morses should pay Miss B the total of A plus B.
D)The overall pattern of Miss Bs borrowing for loans 22 and 23 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Morses should remove these loans entirely from 
Miss Bs credit file. If Morses has sold any of the loans Morses should ask the debt 
purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. It should give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Bs complaint in part and I direct that Morses Club 
PLC does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
