The complaint
Mr A complains that the fee waiver on a Platinum Account (PA) he has held for many years 
was removed by Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has had the benefits of a PA for many years without paying a fee as he maintained an 
account balance over the level Lloyds set to have the fee waived.
Mr A says that Lloyds has broken its agreement with him by removing the fee waiver 
recently.
I can see that Mr A is very disappointed and not happy that Lloyds has removed the fee 
waiver after so many years.
So, Ive considered his arguments very carefully.
Ive looked at the agreement between Mr A and Lloyds and I can see that it provided for 
either party to change or terminate the agreement provided appropriate notice is given. And 
it requires Lloyds to give Mr A the option of downgrading or closing the account if the 
account is changed.
Lloyds recently made a commercial decision to end the fee waiver, which it is entitled to do 
provided it met the terms of the agreement.
And I think it did. I say this because the letter it sent Mr A notifies him of the change two 
months in advance and provides the option of downgrading or closing the PA.
So, although I know that Mr A will be very disappointed, in my view, Lloyds hasnt done 
anything wrong in this matter.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
