The complaint
Mr L complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the service they provided when 
they processed a claim he made under their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP).
What happened
On 19 June 2021, Mr L purchased several items from a retailer, who Ill refer to as K, using 
his PayPal account.
But Mr L wasnt happy with the items he received, the discounts applied by K or the way the 
items were installed at his property. So, on 9 August, Mr L raised a Significantly Not as 
Described (SNAD) claim under PayPals BPP. Mr L made it clear to PayPal that he was 
seeking a partial refund of the total amount hed paid and that hed be unable to return some 
items as they had already been assembled.
PayPal progressed Mr Ls SNAD claim. But on multiple occasions, they requested proof that 
Mr L had returned the items so a refund could be issued. But Mr L explained that he was 
unable to return the items and instead was looking for a partial refund to acknowledge Ks 
errors and his unhappiness. So, on 19 October, PayPal declined Mr Ls claim.
Mr L then filed a chargeback with his bank, which was partially successful. But Mr L was 
unhappy with the service hed received from PayPal. So, he raised a complaint.
Mr L thought PayPal shouldve made him aware hed be unable to seek a partial refund 
through their claim process sooner. And that if they had, he wouldve been able to raise a 
section 75 refund claim through his credit card company which he thinks wouldve been 
successful. Mr L thought the delays created by PayPal have prevented this. And he thought 
he had wasted time and energy speaking to PayPal on multiple occasions. So, he wanted to 
be compensated for this.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and initially, they didnt uphold it. They focused on 
PayPals decision to decline the SNAD claim which they thought was fair, under the terms of 
the BPP. So, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more. Mr L responded 
explaining he was unhappy with PayPals communication, and the fact they delayed him in 
raising a claim with his credit card company. Our investigator looked into this aspect of the 
complaint again and upheld it, recommending PayPal pay Mr L £100. They thought PayPal 
couldve made Mr L aware sooner a partial refund couldnt be obtained and that items would 
need to be returned in order to receive a full refund. So, they thought the £100 recognised 
the upset and inconvenience Mr L was caused.
Mr L didnt agree. He didnt think the £100 recommended was enough to compensate him 
for the distress hed been caused, as well as the financial loss hed incurred. As Mr L didnt 
agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr L. I appreciate he 
purchased several items for a significant sum from K. So, I can understand why hed be left 
upset and frustrated when some of these items werent what hed chosen. And that others 
had been delivered and installed damaged, while others were more expensive than hed 
been told. For all those reasons, I can understand why Mr L would feel as though he was 
due some money back. And when K didnt provide this, I can understand why Mr L would 
seek alternative methods for a refund, including PayPal and their BPP.
And when he spoke to PayPal about the SNAD claim he raised, I recognise Mr L wouldve 
expected PayPal to ensure he was given the correct information he required in a timely 
manner. So, when the claim was declined, and Mr L realised the claim he raised was 
unlikely to ever provide him with the outcome he was seeking, I can understand why Mr L 
would feel as though PayPal had acted unfairly.
Before considering the service and information PayPal provided, Ive first thought about the 
actual decision to decline the claim. Im aware PayPals decision to decline the claim isnt Mr 
Ls main area of dispute and from what Ive read, I think Mr L understands PayPals 
reasoning for this. Even so, Ive looked at the terms of PayPals BPP to satisfy myself that it 
was a fair decision to make.
And having done so, I think it was. I think the terms of the BPP make it reasonably clear that 
for a claim to be successful, the items Mr L was unhappy with would need to be returned. 
And its not disputed that Mr L didnt return these, as many of them had already been 
assembled so a return wasnt possible. And Mr L doesnt dispute it wasnt a full refund he 
was looking for. But instead, a partial refund to acknowledge the poor level of service he felt 
K had provided. 
I think the terms of the BPP make it reasonably clear that the BPP wasnt designed to settle 
disputes of this nature. And it was instead designed to give buyers some form of protection if 
the items purchased werent received, or we significantly different to what was expected. 
The BPP isnt designed to resolve complaints between a buyer and a seller about the level 
of service provided, the sales process or any form of installation. So, Im satisfied that 
PayPal have acted fairly when declining Mr Ls claim.
But I dont think they reached this decision in a reasonable amount of time. I can see the 
claim was raised and escalated by mid-August. So, it took almost two months to reach a 
conclusion.
And in this time, Ive seen email exchanges between PayPal, and listened to phone 
conversations they held. In a call on 3 September, I think Mr L makes it reasonably clear to 
PayPal that he is only looking for a partial refund. And that he was unable to return the items 
as they were requesting. So, I think at this point PayPal shouldve made Mr L reasonably 
aware that his claim was unlikely to be successful and instead, direct him to make a claim 
with his bank or card providers directly.
But I cant see they did this. So, Mr L continued to discuss the claim with them. And I think if 
PayPal had acted fairly and reasonably, this contact couldve been prevented. So, I think 
PayPal have failed to act fairly here. As I dont think theyve acted fairly, Ive then thought about what I think PayPal should do to put things right.
Putting things right
Any award or direction I make is intended to place Mr L back in the position he wouldve 
been in, had PayPal acted fairly in the first instance.
In this situation, I think Mr Ls SNAD claim would always have been declined. And so, I dont 
think PayPal would ever have refunded Mr L the £400 he was hoping for. So, I havent 
considered this figure when deciding what PayPal should do.
But had PayPal given Mr L better and clearer information when he spoke to them on 3 
September, I dont think he wouldve need to take the time and effort to contact PayPal on 
several occasions after this date, until the claim was declined. Ive listened to the 
conversations between Mr L and PayPal, and I think its clear he was finding the situation 
stressful and upsetting. I think this stress and upset couldve been avoided, or at least 
reduced, had PayPal explained to Mr L that his SNAD claim was unlikely to be successful 
earlier.
Mr L says this delay resulted in him being unable to raise a section 75 claim with his credit 
card providers. But I can see that Mr L paid for the entire purchase with K on one card. And 
Ive seen its been confirmed that he did receive a partial refund from a chargeback he made 
with his bank. So, I think its reasonable for me to assume Mr L was able to make a claim 
with his card provider and so, I dont think Im able to say PayPals service has caused Mr L 
a financial loss. 
And even in a situation where Mr L had made a partial payment on a credit card, and so was 
able to raise a section 75 claim, I dont think PayPal would be solely responsible for Mr Ls 
failure to do so in time as it wouldve been Mr Ls responsibility to ensure he did so within the 
cards relevant time limits. And while I think PayPal couldve settled the SNAD claim sooner, 
there was nothing to prevent Mr L raising a section 75 claim earlier, if this is the route he 
wished to take.
Our investigator recommended that PayPal pay Mr L £100 to recognise the distress and 
inconvenience hes been caused. And I think this offer is a fair one which falls in line with our 
services approach and one I wouldve directed; had it not already been made.
I think it adequately recognised the unnecessary delay in the closure of Mr Ls claim with 
PayPal and the inconvenience this caused Mr L as he contacted PayPal for updates, as well 
as engaging in their claim process, when the claim was never likely to succeed. But I think it 
also considers the fact K were the ones responsible for the faulty goods and installation and 
that Mr K has been able to obtain a partial refund through other means.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Ls complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and I direct them to take the following action:
Pay Mr L £100 to recognise the upset and inconvenience hes been caused by the 
service theyve provided.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2022.
