Mr Y said that Sunny didnt carry out effective affordability checks before providing him with 
the loans and that had adequate checks taken place the loans wouldnt have been provided.
Sunny said that before all loans were provided it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks to ensure the amount borrowed could be paid without undue difficulties. 
It said that based on the information gathered the loan repayments were affordable for Mr Y.
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans 5 to 30. She thought that by loan 5, 
Sunny ought to have been alerted to the possibility that Mr Y was having problems 
managing his money and that it was unlikely that he could sustainably repay this and 
subsequent loans. She thought that by loan 9, Mr Ys pattern of borrowing showed he was 
persistently reliant on short term loans and that this pattern itself showed that this loan and 
subsequent loans were unsustainable.
Sunny noted our adjudicators comments about the number of loans Mr Y had outstanding at 
one time and said that its product allowed for up to four loans to be taken out concurrently 
subject to affordability and creditworthiness checks. It said it took into account the other 
loans Mr Y had outstanding at the time of providing a new loan. Sunny did accept that it 
would have been prudent to carry out further checks when Mr Y had been borrowing from it 
for over 12 months. It offered to uphold Mr Ys complaint in regard to loans 18 onwards.
Mr Y didnt accept Sunnys offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We've set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr Y could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable). 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr Y could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having 
to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ys complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans 1 to 4. Given these were the first four loans in the lending 
chain, I find that the information gathered before these loans were provided was adequate. 
As this suggested that the loans were affordable I agree with our adjudicator that I cannot 
say these loans shouldnt have been provided.
When Mr Y took out loan 5, he had three other loans outstanding with Sunny. He also had 
another loan outstanding with another short term loan provider. I have taken into 
consideration the comment made by Sunny about how its product works and that up to four 
loans can be taken out concurrently. However, I still find that when Mr Y applied for loan 5, 
Sunny should have been concerned that he was struggling to manage his money.
When loan 5 was taken out, Mr Y was making combined repayments on his loans with 
Sunny of around £300 a month. Although his disposable income was recorded as £363, 
looking at the information gathered on his expenses compared to his income this left a 
disposable income of around £200. Taking into account Sunnys comments about it including 
the previous loans when considering lending, I still find this causes concern. The loans were 
repayable over around six months through weekly instalments and so Mr Y was required to 
meet his commitments over this term. While the incremental cost of loan 5 was around £32 
his credit commitments had increased significantly and these now cost him over £1,000 a 
month compared to an income of £1,560. This had increased from under £250 when loans 2 
and 3 were provided in the previous month. Given the increase in his credit commitments 
and his low disposable income I think Sunny should have realised that Mr Y was likely to 
struggle to sustainably afford the repayments on this and subsequent loans.
Our adjudicator thought that by loan 9 Mr Ys pattern of borrowing showed that he had 
become persistently reliant on short term loans. I think this point was reached at loan 10. I 
say this because at loan 10, Mr Y had been borrowing from Sunny for around nine months 
and this was his tenth loan. He was taking out new loans before previous loans were repaid. 
He took advantage of taking out four loans concurrently in June and July 2017 and after 
repaying these he then took out new borrowing shortly after. He again increased his 
borrowing to the full four loans and then, after repaying a loan (loan 7) he immediately took 
out loan 10. I think this shows that Mr Y was needing to take out new borrowing to fill the 
hole left in his finances from repaying previous loans. Also, as the amounts he was 
borrowing werent reducing and he had been borrowing for a number of months, I think this shows he was not using the loans to meet a short term need but instead was reliant on them 
for his ongoing needs.
Because of the above, I agree with our adjudicator that this complaint should be upheld from 
loan 5 onwards.  
Putting things right
I am upholding this complaint in regard to loans 5 to 30 and require Sunny to take the 
following action:
Refund any interest and charges Mr Y paid on loans 5 to 30 along with  simple 
interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*.
If any loans are still outstanding then all payments made should be considered as if 
they were payments towards the capital amount and any over payments should be 
refunded along with simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date they 
arose to the date of settlement.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ys credit file in relation to loans 5 
to 9.
The overall pattern of Mr Ys borrowing from loan 10 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 10 to 30 should be removed from 
Mr Y's credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ys complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr Y compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
