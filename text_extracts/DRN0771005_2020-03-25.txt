Miss J says Oakam  Ltd (Oakam) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight loans Oakam provided to Miss J between  July 2013 and March  
2016. Miss J also applied to top up her loans on four occasions on 3 January 2014,12 April 
2014, 21 June  2014 and 13 October 2014.  Miss Js borrowing history is as follows:

8 14/03/2016 18/01/2017 6 £298.57
In its final response,  Oakam said it reviewed each loan to see if the correct lending 
procedures were followed before being approved. It carried out affordability checks  and 
based on the completed checks  and the information disclosed by Miss J she displayed 
affordability to repay the loans. And in relation to her top up loans, each refinance was 
approved as the affordability assessments showed  that Miss J had the disposable income 
required to manage  the repayments due.
Our adjudicator said that having  thought about everything he hadnt seen enough to say it 
was unfair  for Oakam to provide loans  1-4 to Miss J. But he said loans 5-8 shouldnt  have 
been provided as by this time it was evident  Miss J was having problems managing  her 
money. Oakam did not agree with this view and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Oakam needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Oakam should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN07710052the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Oakam  was required to establish  
whether Miss J could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Js complaint. Ive decided to uphold this complaint  
from loan 5 onwards.  I will explain why.
When Oakam provided loan 5 to Miss J, it said it had carried out proportionate  checks.  But I 
dont think it did all it needed to. Oakam  would have likely been aware that Miss J had 
already increased  the amount she owed by £319 and there was now £1,946  owing. Loan 5 
was repayable over a period of 12 months.  But it appears that for all the previous loans she 
had taken out she had repaid them early and borrowed further small sums. So I dont think  
she was using the loans in the way she intended but using these loans more like payday 
loans.
Between September 2013 and June 2014 Miss Js disposable income had reduced  and by 
loan 5 she received  only £595.70 per month. Her declared disposable  income was £172.37. 
So she had to maintain loan repayments  of £76.00 per month over a 12 month  period.  And 
for loan 5 she now owed twice  the amount she had originally borrowed. So I think its unlikely 
this loan would have been sustainably  affordable.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Oakams  lending history with Miss J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Oakam should  reasonably have seen that further lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Oakam should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN07710053Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Js case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Oakam ought to have realised Miss J was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss J had taken out six loans within 15 months  and Miss J had 
been indebted to Oakam for all those  months without any gap. So Oakam ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Miss J was having to borrow  further  to cover 
the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances  and that Miss Js 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Js first loan was for £200.00 and loan 6 was a top up loan for 100.00 but by 
now she owed a total of over £500.00.  And Miss J had other credit amounting to 
£3,286 and also had arrears. At this point  Oakam ought to have known that Miss J 
was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in their income  but to meet  an 
ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss J was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. On many  occasions she hadnt  yet paid back her previous loan and 
asked for more money to refinance  her existing loans in January, April,  June and 
October and when she took out loans 3, 4,5,6 and loan 8 she repaid the previous 
loan on the same  day she took out her new loan.
Miss J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Oakam.  Loan 8 was 
taken out almost 32 months after Miss Js first. And it was for almost the same 
amount, but it was added together with the amount she already owed. Miss J had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Oakam over an extended  
period.
I think that Miss J lost out because Oakam continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Js indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss J borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Js ability to access mainstream credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 5 and loans 6-8 and Oakam  should put 
things right.
Ref: DRN07710054putting things right  what Oakam needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss J paid on 5-8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Miss Js credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6- 8 means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  6-8 should be removed from Miss Js 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Oakam to take off tax from this interest.  Oakam  must 
give Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Js complaint. Oakam Ltd should 
put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
