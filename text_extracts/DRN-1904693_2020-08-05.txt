The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to credit two travellers 
cheques to his account.
What happened
Mr S attended a NatWest branch to deposit two travellers cheques for £500 each that were 
in the name of a relative. He says NatWest told him to countersign the cheques which he 
did. But the money wasn't credited to his account, and the cheques were sent back to a 
different bank. Mr S would like £1,000 compensation for what he says is NatWest's mistake.
NatWest says it took the cheques in good faith, but they couldn't be paid into Mr S's account 
as they were in the name of a family member. It says it paid £50 compensation as it initially 
thought the mistake was caused by asking Mr S to countersign the cheques. NatWest says it 
had no choice but to send the cheques to the bank that requested them and says Mr S's 
family member can contact it for the money. It says Mr S hasn't suffered a loss and so will 
not pay the £1,000 Mr S would like.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didn't uphold it. The investigator 
thought the traveller cheques couldn't be paid to Mr S and so it doesn't matter what NatWest 
told him. The investigator also thought Mr S's family member ought to have been aware of 
that information.
Mr S doesn't accept that view and questions why NatWest told him to countersign the 
cheques as it was obvious his name was not on those cheques. He says he should have 
been told that and says his family member lives in India and can't be expected to sort 
matters out. Mr S would like at least £200 compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the 
overall view that I don't require NatWest to increase its compensation offer for the reasons I 
will explain.
I accept that Mr S ought to have been told when he attended the NatWest branch that he 
couldn't pay the travellers cheques into his account as they were not payable to him and not 
in his name. I think it likely NatWest staff made a mistake by asking Mr S to countersign the 
cheques and also made a mistake by attempting to pay them into his account. I also think it 
likely NatWest was trying to help Mr S.
I can see that NatWest attempted to pay the cheques into Mr S's account but was unable to 
do so and was asked by another bank to return them to it. I don't think NatWest made a 
mistake by doing so and I also don't think it had a choice.
I can see that NatWest paid Mr S £50 compensation and I'm satisfied that is a fair and reasonable amount for that part of what took place. I think that if Mr S had been given the 
correct information then he would have been in exactly the same position he is in now and 
wouldn't have been able to cash the cheques. But I accept Mr S has been caused some 
inconvenience and that the compensation paid fairly reflects that.
I don't think Mr S has suffered a £1,000 loss as the only person that can cash the cheques is 
Mr S's family member. I don't think there has been any loss as I can see that Mr S has the 
serial numbers of the cheques and no doubt his family member can use those numbers to 
trace the cheques. I accept Mr S's family member may be caused some inconvenience in 
doing so but that is not something I can fairly consider in this complaint. I also appreciate the 
family member lives in India. But that would have been a difficulty even if NatWest had given 
Mr S the correct advice and given him the cheques back, as they would have to be cashed 
or sorted out by that person in any event.
Overall whilst I accept that NatWest ought to have told Mr S it couldn't cash the cheques. I 
can't fairly order it to increase the compensation it's paid for the reasons I have explained.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2020.
