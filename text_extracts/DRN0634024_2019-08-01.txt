K820x#14complaint
Mrs B says Tesco Personal Finance PLC mis-sold her a payment protection  insurance 
(PPI) policy.  
background
Mrs B bought the policy in 2008  at the same time as taking out a credit  card online. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs B disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Bs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Bs complaint because:
 The online application  process required Mrs B to click a yes or no box to indicate if she 
wanted PPI. So I think Tesco  made  Mrs B aware that she had a choice about buying 
the PPI, and that she chose to take it. 
 Tesco didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs B so it didnt have to check if it was right for 
her. 
 Its possible the information Tesco gave Mrs B about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs B doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. While she had some sick pay, the PPI 
wouldve paid out on top of this so she couldve used her sick pay for other things. So I 
dont think better  information  wouldve stopped her buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Bs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
