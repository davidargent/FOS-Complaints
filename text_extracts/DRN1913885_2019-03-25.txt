K820x#14complaint
Mr B says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN),  trading  as QuickQuid (QQ) and Pounds to 
Pocket (PtP),  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr B had three loans  with CEN. Loans 1 and 3 were payday loans with QQ, repayable  in two 
monthly payments   the first payment  was interest only and the second interest and capital. 
Loan 2 was an instalment loan with PtP, repayable  in 12 monthly  instalments. Ive set out 
some of the information  CEN provided about  the loans below. 
Loan 
no.Amount Start date End date Payment schedule
1 (QQ) £400 06/10/2011 30/11/2011£40 on 31 Oct 2011
£440 on 30 Nov 2011
2 (PtP) £950 05/12/2011 30/11/2012 12 monthly payments of £141
3 (QQ) £850 23/10/2012 n/a£170 on 22 Nov 2012
£1,020  on 21 Dec 2012
Mr B withdrew his complaint about loan 1 and said he wanted  to continue his complaint 
about the other loans. Loan 1 still forms part of this history of lending  in Mr Bs case, so Ill 
take its existence into account when  looking at the complaint about loans 2 and 3.
CEN offered to refund  the interest and charges Mr B paid on loan 3. This will still leave  an 
outstanding principal balance for Mr B to pay. Our adjudicator endorsed CENs offer and 
didnt recommend the complaint about loan 2 be upheld. Mr B didnt accept the adjudicators  
opinion, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Throughout the period of lending, the regulator  was the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT). The 
OFT had published guidance  on irresponsible lending (ILG), including  an updated  version in 
February 2011. The ILG makes it clear lenders have a duty to lend responsibly  this 
includes undertaking proportionate affordability  checks to ensure customers  can repay loans 
sustainably. The definition of a sustainable repayment includes that payments should be 
made from income and/or savings, without undue  difficulty and while meeting other  
reasonable commitments. 
Theres no prescriptive list of the sort of checks a lender should carry out, but the guidance 
says lenders may wish to take into account  factors such  as the type of credit,  a customers  
credit history  and their existing  financial commitments.
With this in mind, Ive considered whether CEN  carried out proportionate checks for loan 2 
and, if it didnt, what I think such checks are likely  to have  shown.
CEN recorded Mr Bs net monthly  income  as £1,300 for loan 2. CEN also carried  out credit 
checks, although it hasnt shown us the full results  of these. Mr Bs employment status was 
also recorded. CEN didnt record any information about Mr Bs expenditure.
Ref: DRN19138852The monthly repayments for loan 2 were only about 11% of Mr Bs monthly income.  I dont 
think it was unreasonable for CEN  to think they were  affordable  to him. This was only his 
second loan and his first was repaid according to the contractual  schedule.  Mr B says loan 1 
was rolled over in November 2011  so CEN  shouldve done  further  checks for loan 2. But 
I dont think this is correct. The rollover in this case was the contractual  scheduled interest 
payment, not something Mr B asked  to do after the loan was approved. So I dont think  CEN 
had reason to think Mr B was in financial difficulty when he applied  for loan 2.
Mr B says if CEN had looked at his bank statements it wouldve seen, several  other  
payday loans,  a bank loan and other  debt commitments. But I dont think  such checks 
wouldve been proportionate for loan 2, which came early in Mr Bs relationship with CEN 
and had repayments which were fairly small relative to his income.
CEN has already  made an offer in respect  of loan 3. That offer is in line with this services 
general approach  to redress  for short-term loans.  I cant see that theres any reason for CEN  
to make a different  offer in Mr Bs case.  So I think CENs  offer is fair and I leave it to Mr B to 
decide whether  or not to accept it.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
