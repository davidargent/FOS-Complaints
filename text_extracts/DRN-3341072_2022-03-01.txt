The complaint
Mrs M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Classic lent irresponsibly when it
approved her credit card application.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Mrs M applied for a credit card with NewDay in January 2020. In the application, NewDay 
recorded that Mrs M was employed with an income of £16,000 a year and a net monthly 
income of £1,201. NewDay also recorded Mrs Ms partners income as £1,145. NewDay 
says it found no arrears or adverse credit information on Mrs Ms credit file and found she 
owed around £14,000 in unsecured debt. NewDay approved Mrs Ms application with a 
credit limit of £600.
Mrs M maintained payments until May 2020 when she missed a payment. Mrs M missed 
another payment in July 2020 and has explained she was made redundant a short time later.
Mrs M complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly when it approved her credit card but it 
didnt agree. Mrs M went on to refer her complaint to this service and it was passed to an 
investigator. The investigator thought NewDay had dealt with Mrs Ms complaint fairly and 
didnt ask it to do anything else. Mrs M asked to appeal so her complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mrs M could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like:
-The amount of credit;
-The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
-The duration of the agreement
-The costs of the credit; and
-The consumers individual circumstances.
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required 
to consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
In this case, NewDay recorded that Mrs M had a net income of £1,200 a month. I note the 
application doesnt include any information about Mrs Ms relationship status, but it also 
includes her partners net monthly income of £1,145. NewDay says that taking both figures 
together, the credit card was affordable for Mrs M.
Ive considered whether thats a reasonable approach in Mrs Ms case. I understand 
NewDay may use household income to assess whether a new credit card is affordable. But 
it still has to ensure any lending complies with the regulations and ensure its sustainable 
for the borrower. Ive looked at the figures in Mrs Ms application and can see NewDay used 
outgoings of around £995, leaving Mrs M with around £200 of disposable income. But the 
application also records Mrs M had around £14,000 of unsecured debt to service as well.
Without using Mrs Ms partners income to support the application, I think its likely NewDay 
wouldve found a new credit card wasnt affordable for Mrs M and declined it.
NewDay used both incomes. But before agreeing to rely on someone elses income to 
support Mrs Ms loan, I think NewDay shouldve done more to ensure that was a 
sustainable approach. By simply taking the partners income NewDay had no knowledge of 
their circumstances, commitments or long-term affordability to assist with repayments.
In addition to the lack of disposable income, I think the reliance on Mrs Ms partners 
income to support credit card repayments shouldve caused NewDay to complete better 
checks.
Theres a range of information NewDay couldve asked Mrs M to provide to support her 
application, for example payslips or bank statements.
Mrs M has sent us her bank statements for the months preceding the January 2020 
application. The statements dont show Mrs M was receiving £1,145 a month from her 
partner or that her income was in line with the information provided in the application. Had 
NewDay carried out better checks, I think they wouldve found new borrowing was 
unaffordable for Mrs M and declined her credit card application. As a result, I intend to 
uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
As I think NewDay lent irresponsibly, I intend to tell it to refund all interest, fees and charges 
applied to the credit card debt from inception to date. I also dont think its fair for NewDay 
to record any adverse information on Mrs Ms credit file relating to a debt that was lent 
irresponsibly. So I also intend to tell NewDay to amend Mrs Ms credit file and remove all 
adverse information recorded about the Amazon Classic credit card.
Im aware Mrs M has experienced financial difficulties and has been unable to maintain the 
credit card payments. Once the above settlement has been put in place, NewDay should 
treat Mrs M in a positive and sympathetic manner, ensuring any payment arrangement it 
agrees is affordable
I invited both parties to respond with any additional information they wanted me to consider 
before I made my final decision. Neither party responded.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither provided new information for me to consider, I see no reason to change the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Mrs Ms complaint should be 
upheld, for the same reasons. My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint and direct NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon 
Classic to settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges from the date of inception to the date of settlement
- If the above leaves an outstanding balance, NewDay should contact Mrs M within four 
weeks of settlement to discuss the possibility of a sustainable and affordable repayment 
plan
- If the above has the effect of there no longer being an outstanding balance, then any
extra should be treated as overpayments and returned to Mrs M along with 8%
simple interest on the overpayments from the date they were made (if they were)
until the date of settlement
- Amend Mrs Ms credit file to remove all adverse information recorded about the
Amazon Classic credit card
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2022.
