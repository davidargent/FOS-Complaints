K822xcomplaint
Mr H complained about a number  of loans he took out through  a company called Elevate 
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr H says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr H took out 19 loans from Sunny  between  December 2015 and 
October 2017. Ive enclosed a summary  of his borrowing with Sunny,  based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
I issued a provisional decision (summary attached) in April 2020 about this case, 
comprehensively setting  out why I thought the complaint should  be partly upheld  from the 
point of loan number 6, rather than loan 4, as our adjudicator had recommended.  I asked 
both parties to provide any further  submissions  or information to me within one month.  
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Neither party has added anything new. Theres therefore no reason for me to change  the 
findings I previously  set out. I uphold this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 19, fully in line 
with my provisional decision.
In order to put things  right for Mr H, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 - 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 17 - 19 and treat any 
payments Mr H made towards these loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Hs loans 17 - 19 accounts  as Ive directed results  in him effectively 
having made payments above  the original capital borrowed, then Sunny should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated  on the overpayments,  
from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date of settlement;  
If reworking Mr Hs loans 17 - 19 accounts  leave an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then Sunny can use the total refund for the other upheld  loans  to offset this. And if 
there is still an outstanding capital balance  then I would remind Sunny that it should 
take a sympathetic view when seeking  to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Mr H for the remaining capital;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 -19 should be completely 
removed from Mr Hs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr H a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN57220442my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partly uphold this complaint  and I direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to pay Mr H the above compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2020.

Ive considered the relevant  information about this complaint. Based on what  Ive seen so far Im 
thinking about  still partially upholding the complaint, but not quite to the extent our adjudicator 
recommended. Ill look at any more comments I get by 14 May 2020. 
Unless the information changes my mind, my final decision is likely to be along  the following lines. 
Final decisions will be published on our website.  So that the consumer cant be identified,  Ill call him 
Mr H.
complaint
Mr H complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called Elevate Credit 
International Limited, trading  at the time as Sunny. I note he is represented and advised  by a third 
party claims company. Mr H says he was lent to irresponsibly and the loans  caused him financial 
problems.
To keep things simple  Ill refer mainly  to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know  that Mr H took out 19 loans from Sunny  between December 2015  and October 2017. 
Ive enclosed a summary of his borrowing with Sunny, based on the information  it provided  to us. It 
can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and said they thought it should  be upheld from the 
point of loan number 4 onwards. Sunny  didnt agree with the adjudicators view although  it did make 
an alternative offer, which  wasnt  accepted by Mr H. Its therefore come to me for an ombudsmans 
decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  Ive 
followed this approach when  thinking about Mr Hs complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Mr H could repay  the 
loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have  taken into account  a range  
of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total repayment amount and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. However,  certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should have 
fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
Ref: DRN57220444the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point,  as in this case, where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates  that the lending was unsustainable.  So Sunny was required to establish  whether  
Mr H could sustainably repay the loans, not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the re-payments  being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  that Mr H could 
sustainably make  them.  But it doesnt automatically follow  that this is the case. This is because the 
relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. So, it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought to have fairly and reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they are unlikely  to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator said they thought  the complaint  about loan numbers 1 - 3 ought  not to be upheld. But 
they said that by loan number 4, there were signs Mr H was having  problems managing money. 
Bearing in mind  what Ive said above about the length of the lending  relationship, I think the checks  
which Sunny  most likely carried for loans 1 - 3 would have been quite basic ones, but they were  
probably proportionate to the lending  thus far. Nor do I think they would have revealed an obvious  
reason not to lend to Mr H. For loan numbers  4 and 5, I think the types of financial checks  ought  to 
have been more  comprehensive  because Mr H had been borrowing fairly  successively over about  5 
months.
But where  I disagree with our adjudicator  is that even if Sunny had done better checks,  I still dont 
think this would have really changed things. I think Sunny would  have still lent him money  for loans 4 
and 5, not least  since  hed paid most  of the previous loans off, and quite often he repaid them  early. I 
accept some loans up to this point overlapped  with a previous one, but there only ever seemed to be 
one loan overlapping with another at any one point and this was mostly only over a short period of 
time. So Im afraid I dont currently agree that by loan 5 it could be seen that Mr H was having 
difficulty managing,  even  though its entirely  possible  he was. 
I therefore  dont intend to uphold his complaint about loans 1  5. 
However, I think from the point of loan 6 onwards,  the situation  was different. By this time I think an 
emerging pattern of repeated lending  was becoming  clear. By then, hed been borrowing  repeatedly 
and regularly  with Sunny for 7 months and this pattern should  have caused Sunny to see that Mr H 
wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term  cash-flow problems;  he was borrowing  regularly, to 
address shortfalls in his income and to meet an ongoing need. Mr H was having to consistently  take 
out high interest, short-term lending  over a sustained  period and the indebtedness caused  by this type 
of borrowing was harmful, in my view.  We also know he went on to be lent money a further 14 times 
in the next year-and-a-half  or so. Sunny should have seen this by loan number 6 and should  have 
realised Mr H was at risk of not managing  to repay the loans sustainably and was probably  in financial 
difficulties. 
So Im considering upholding this complaint in respect of loans 6  19. For these loans Sunny 
repeatedly lent to Mr H in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use, over an extended period; and
the length  of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications on 
his ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost loans
Ref: DRN57220445Im therefore  intending to partially  uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
my provisional  decision
I am intending to partially uphold Mr Hs complaint and direct  Elevate Credit  International Limited, to 
put things right for Mr H as set out above. 
I will however carefully  consider any further information or corrections from either party, providing I get 
it by 10 May 2020. After  that Ill issue a final decision.
