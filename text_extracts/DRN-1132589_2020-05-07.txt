The complaint
Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to him. Mr W has told us he couldnt afford the borrowing and had to re-borrow to 
finance them. He had borrowings with other short-term loan providers at the same time as 
Sunny.
What happened
This complaint is about 15 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr W between June 2015 
and September 2017. Mr Ws borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint and thought the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been given as it looked like Mr W was having problems managing 
its finances. 
Sunny disagreed. It said it had carried out sufficient checks and the lending was affordable 
for Mr W.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr W didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr W had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to partially 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain why
When Mr W applied for loan five, he still had loans three and four running with Sunny. So, 
including loan five, he was in debt to Sunny for £800 and his monthly repayments would 
have increased accordingly. In response to the adjudicator, Sunny said the borrowing was 
affordable to Mr W. It said it had asked Mr W about his income and expenditure, whether he 
had other short-term borrowing and carried out a credit check. Sunny also told us its short-
term lending product gives its customers flexibility in that it allows a customer to take up to 
four loans at any one time. 
But I think that when Mr W applied for loan five, and the other two loans were still running, 
this should have caused Sunny some concern and it should have looked to build a bigger 
picture of his financial position to establish whether what information Mr W had given to 
Sunny was a fair reflection of his financial circumstances. If it had done so, it would have 
seen that Mr W was borrowing from another short-term lender as well. This would have been 
a strong indication that Mr W was struggling to keep on top of his finances. And Mr W has 
told us he couldnt afford the borrowing, so this seems likely. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ws case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan seven. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out seven loans within ten months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I note Mr W was repaying his loans earlier than the agreed term. This would have 
saved him interest but shortly after repaying he would then return for additional 
borrowing. Given the nature of high-cost short-term lending, I would question why 
someone would repay one loan only to return for additional borrowing shortly 
afterwards. This would suggest to me that the borrowing was unsustainable.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 15 was 
taken out 27 months after Mr Ws first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr W had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan seven 
onwards because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 15 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Putting things right
I understand Sunny has already written off an outstanding balance of £78.92 as a gesture of 
goodwill. When putting things right, Sunny should take that into account if appropriate 
(whether its capital borrowed rather than interest or charges on the upheld loans). 
refund all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans five to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about five and six from Mr Ws credit file;
the number of loans taken from seven onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans seven to 15 should be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2020.
