K820x#14Complaint
Mr J complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc closed his account. Hes also unhappy  
that NatWest continued  to send him information  after his account was closed.
Background
On 7 February 2019, Mr J applied  to open  a current account with NatWest.
NatWest told Mr J that his account had been opened and he was given  his new account  
number and sort code.  Five days later NatWest  completed its account  opening  checks  and 
decided to close the account  immediately.  
Mr J says he hasnt done anything which would cause NatWest  to close  his accounts and 
hes explained that the banks actions have caused  him a great deal of stress and upset. 
Hes said he wasnt  able to work because he had no accounts  for customers  to pay him and 
his mental health  suffered. He also said he felt harassed by NatWest  because the bank 
continued to send him information about his account. 
NatWest wrote to Mr J on 13 February  2019  to let him know  about its decision to close  his 
account. Mr J complained to the bank. NatWest said it hadnt  done anything wrong. And it 
had closed Mr Js account in line with the terms and conditions of the account. Mr J wasnt 
happy with this response so, he brought his complaint to our service.
An investigator looked at Mr Js complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done anything  wrong  
when it closed Mr Js account.  And she couldnt find any evidence  that NatWest  had 
continued to send Mr J information about his closed account. Mr J disagreed. Hes still upset 
by what happened  and says NatWest have  caused him a great  deal of upset by closing his 
account.
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Mr J feels hes been  treated poorly  by NatWest and that it was unfair that 
the bank closed his account. But as the investigator has explained,  NatWest  is entitled to 
decide who it wants as its customers. And once NatWest had completed its secondary  
security and credit checks,  which couldnt be completed at the time of Mr J opening his 
account, NatWest decided to close Mr Js account. 
The terms and conditions  of the account also set out that under certain  circumstances 
NatWest can close  a customers  account  immediately. Having looked  at the information 
NatWest received in response to its credit  checks Im satisfied that NatWest acted in line 
with the terms and conditions. And made  a commercial  decision it did not want Mr J as a 
customer. So, I cant say that NatWest  was wrong  to close the account.
I appreciate that this will be disappointing  to Mr J. And Ive considered everything 
Mr J has told us about how this account  closure affected him. But Ive also considered that 
NatWests policy is to open an account  on application and then complete further checks. 
Ref: DRN20244172This is explained in its terms  and conditions, which Mr J agreed to when he applied to open 
the account. So, all in all I cant say NatWest treated Mr J unfairly when it decided to close 
his account. 
Mr J says after his account was closed NatWest continued to send him information about  his 
account. But I havent seen any evidence that this was the case. NatWest has confirmed that 
it didnt contact Mr J about  his closed account. And Mr J hasnt provided  any specific  
information about what information  he received from NatWest which made him feel 
harassed. So, I cant consider this point further.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr J feels about whats  happened.  So, I realise Mr J 
will be disappointed by my decision, but overall,  based on the evidence Ive seen,  I cant  say 
NatWest have acted  unreasonably and treated Mr J unfairly when  it closed his account.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
