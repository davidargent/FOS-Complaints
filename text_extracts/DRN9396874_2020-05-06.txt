K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Skoda Financial 
Services, wont refund to him the advance payment that he made for a car that was supplied 
to him under  a hire purchase agreement and which he says wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
Skoda Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was 
of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr F. Whether or not it was of satisfactory  
quality at that time will depend on a number of factors,  including the age and mileage of the 
car and the price  that was paid for it. The car that was supplied  to him was more  than three  
and a half years old, had been driven  for 37,700  miles and had a price  of £9,742.19. 
Satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  the car 
must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long that time is will 
depend on a number of factors. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the car passed  an MOT test in February  2019, before it was supplied  to Mr F, and 
worn front tyres  and oil on the left front shock  absorber were noted  as advisories;
Mr F had an issue with the car on the day that it was supplied  to him and he 
contacted the dealer;
it asked him to return the car so that  the  issue could be investigated  but he didnt do 
so and had the car health-checked by another garage;
the health  check  gave a red warning that the front tyres were worn and an amber  
warning that the near side shock absorber  was leaking   so the issues identified in 
the health check were  consistent with the advisories that had been noted at the MOT 
test;
Im not persuaded that those issues were enough to cause the car not to have been 
of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr F  at the time of the health check  
the tyres  were still roadworthy and the condition of them  would have been  visible  to 
Mr F on an inspection  of the car before he entered into the agreement   and the oil 
leak on the shock absorber was not significant enough to cause the car to fail the 
MOT test or to prevent Mr F from driving  the car; 
the dealer  had asked Mr F to return the car so that the issues could be investigated  
but he didnt do so - and Im not persuaded  that theres enough  evidence  to show 
that the car wasnt  of satisfactory quality when it was supplied  to him  so I dont 
consider that he had the right to reject the car;
Ref: DRN93968742Mr F left the car near the dealer, posted  the keys through  the dealers letter  box, 
cancelled the agreement without making any payments to Skoda Financial Services  
and claimed a refund of his £1,000 advance payment;
the dealer  accepted the return of the car but didnt  agree to refund to Mr F the 
advance payment that hed made  for it; and
Im not persuaded that Skoda  Financial  Services has acted incorrectly in connection 
with Mr Fs hire purchase agreement  or that it should refund to Mr F the advance 
payment that he made for the car  so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances  for me to require it to refund the advance payment to Mr F or to 
take any other action  in response  to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 June 2020.
