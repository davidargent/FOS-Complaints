K821x#15complaint
Miss P complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her in 
an irresponsible manner.
background
Miss P was given twenty loans by Sunny between January 2016 and November 2016. All of 
the loans were to be repaid by Miss P over 6 instalments but generally Miss P repaid the 
loans within  a few weeks of taking them out. Miss P took out more than 1 loan at a time. A 
summary of Miss Ps borrowing from Sunny is given as an appendix.
Miss Ps complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She thought Sunny 
wasnt wrong to give the first five loans to Miss P. But she didnt think the remaining  loans  
should have been agreed. So she asked Sunny to pay Miss P some compensation.
Both parties  were still not in agreement after that view was issued. So, as the complaint 
hasnt been resolved informally, it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is 
the last stage of our process. If Miss P accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both 
parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN92371582I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint.
Sunny did a number  of checks  before  it lent to Miss P. It asked her for details of her income  
and her normal expenditure.  It gathered  data from credit reference  agencies about other 
credit repayments that Miss P would  need  to make  over the coming months. And it then 
used this information to calculate how much disposable income Miss P had left over each 
month. Sunny also used  the credit  reference  agency checks  to gather some more 
information about Miss Ps financial situation at that time.
The results  from the credit  checks Sunny carried out didnt show any information that might 
have suggested  Miss P was having  problems  managing her money. The repayments  that 
were shown by the credit  check didnt appear  unaffordable based on what shed said about  
her normal  income and expenditure. And the checks didnt show any other concerning 
information such as a reliance on other short term loans, or a significant number of 
delinquent or defaulted  accounts. 
As I mentioned earlier each of Miss Ps loans was repayable  over a six month period. So the 
amounts that she needed to repay each time were smaller than if shed taken a normal  
payday loan. But of course she was committing to making those repayments over a far 
longer period. And at times Miss P had a number of loans outstanding together. So Ive 
needed to consider the total amount  that Miss P needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Miss P typically repaid her loans much earlier than planned should have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. So Ive also taken that into account  when  looking  at whether Sunny should 
have given the loans to Miss P.
That being  said,  the repayments  that Miss P had agreed to make on her first four loans were 
relatively modest compared  to the disposable  income that shed declared to Sunny. So given 
these repayment  amounts,  what was apparent about Miss Ps circumstances at the time, 
and her borrowing  history with the lender,  I dont  think it wouldve been proportionate  for 
Sunny to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to show  the lending  
was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
Ref: DRN92371583I do think, by the time Miss P asked for loan 5, that Sunny should have realised that it 
couldnt safely rely on the information she was providing about her finances. I think it should 
have taken steps at that time to independently verify Miss Ps true financial position. We 
asked Miss P for copies of her bank statements so we could see what better checks  would 
have shown Sunny.  She didnt provide these to us. So Im not able to say that better  checks  
would have shown  Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 5 to Miss P.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss P I think by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
This was now Miss Ps sixth loan request in just 3 months.  Each of the loans Miss P 
had taken had been repayable over a period  of 6 months. But Miss P regularly paid 
those loans off far earlier than planned,  but borrowed a similar  amount  very shortly 
afterwards. I think that pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early should  have 
indicated to Sunny that Miss P was most likely  having significant problems managing  
her money. 
By the time Miss P asked for loan 6, it would have been clear  to Sunny that she 
wasnt making any inroads to the amount she owed it. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss P was provided with a new loan typically  within several 
days of settling a previous  one. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Miss P was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous 
loan was leaving in her finances  and that Miss Ps indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
I think that Miss P lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Miss P from loan 6 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Miss P some compensation.
Ref: DRN92371584putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Miss P after, and including, the loan that 
she took on 15/03/2016 (loan 6 to loan 20). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss P on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 20 should be removed from Miss Ps 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
If Miss P still owes Sunny any of the principal balance she borrowed, Sunny may deduct this 
from the compensation that is due to her. But, to be clear, that outstanding balance should  
be recalculated  to remove any interest and charges, but taking account of any repayments 
Miss P has made on that loan as though  they were applied against the principal sum 
borrowed.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Miss Ps complaint and direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 November 2019.
