K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that Omni Capital Retail Finance Limited wont  refund to him the money  that 
hes paid under a fixed  sum loan agreement for an HGV driving  course.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr H electronically signed a fixed sum loan agreement  with Omni Capital in April 
2018 to pay for an HGV driving  course   the loan agreement described the course as 
Category C (5 days ) with Initial CPC and Pass Protection with a specified course 
provider  the cost of the course was £3,297 and he paid a deposit of £33 - so the 
amount of the loan was £3,264 which was to be repaid by a payment of £96.28 and 
47 monthly payments  of £96.29  the interest rate was 19.9%;
the course provider  stopped trading in October 2018 but Mr H had been offered a job 
starting in January  2019 for which he needed  an HGV licence so he completed the 
training with another provider in December 2018   and hes repaid the loan to Omni 
Capital so the agreement has ended;
Omni Capital arranged for a third party to provide  the course but that wasnt 
acceptable to Mr H so he complained to it and then to this service;
our investigator said that there had been  a breach of contract by the course provider 
because it hadnt provided the course  to Mr H  hed only had the medical  and theory 
test - and she didnt think that the remedy offered by Omni  Capital  fulfilled its 
obligations;
she was satisfied that Mr H would have completed the course had the course 
provider not stopped  trading so she recommended  that Omni Capital should refund 
to Mr H the cost of the course, less the cost of the medical  and theory test, with 
interest and that it should remove any adverse information that was recorded on his 
credit report;
Omni Capital says that it remedied the breach of contract by arranging  for the third 
party to provide the course starting in February 2019  and that it paid the full cost of 
the training course  to the third party on Mr Hs behalf  it also says that Mr H didnt  
tell it that he was going to complete the training with another provider and that it was 
his choice to do so;
it says that it has fully met all of its obligations  and has remedied the breach of 
contract by providing like for like training at no cost to Mr H so it doesnt agree that 
further financial compensation is appropriate  or reasonable;
its clear that the course provider breached its contract with Mr H when it stopped  
trading and, in the circumstances that hes described, I consider  that it was fair and 
reasonable for Mr H to complete the course  with another provider;
Ref: DRN61300942Im not persuaded that the remedy that Omni  Capital offered to Mr H was appropriate 
for him in those  circumstances so I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Omni 
Capital to refund to Mr H the money that he paid to it under the fixed sum loan 
agreement (less  the cost of the medical  and theory test that were  provided by the 
course provider), with interest; and
Ive not seen any evidence to show that Omni Capital  has recorded any adverse 
information about the agreement on Mr Hs credit file but, if it has done, I find that it 
would be fair and reasonable for it to remove that information.

my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint and I order Omni Capital Retail Finance 
Limited to:
1.Refund to Mr H the money  that he paid to it under the fixed  sum loan agreement 
(less the cost of the medical and theory test that were provided by the course 
provider).
2.Pay interest on that refund at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date of each 
payment by Mr H to the date of settlement.
3.Remove any adverse  information about the fixed sum loan agreement  that its 
recorded on Mr Hs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Omni  Capital  to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to at 2 above. Omni Capital must  give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 February  2021.
