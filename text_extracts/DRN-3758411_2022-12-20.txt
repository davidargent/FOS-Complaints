The complaint
Mr P is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has told him he has to close 
two accounts he has with it. 
What happened
Mr P who resides outside the United Kingdom holds a current account and savings account 
with NatWest. His current account receives a number of pension payments from different 
providers into it and as funds accumulate Mr P transfers the funds to his savings account.
In June 2022 Mr P received notification by post that NatWest planned to close his accounts 
on 14 January 2023. This was followed up by email dated 19 July 2022. Mr P was unhappy 
with this, as moving accounts was going to be difficult for him and his family and complained 
to NatWest.
NatWest acknowledged Mr Ps disappointment but say it is becoming a UK focussed bank 
and have made the decision to stop offering banking facilities to customers who live in a 
number of countries throughout the world. 
Mr P was unhappy with this so brought his complaint to this service. 
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ps concerns and reached the conclusion that 
NatWest was entitled to close Mr Ps accounts in line with the terms and conditions of the 
account and hadnt treated Mr P unfairly when deciding to close his accounts. 
Mr P disagreed and has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, to be clear my decision only relates to the open accounts Mr P currently has with 
NatWest. 
My role is to look at the problems Mr P has experienced and see if NatWest has done 
anything wrong. If it has, I would seek  if possible - to put Mr P back in the position he 
wouldve been in if the mistakes hadnt happened. And I may award modest compensation 
that I think is fair and reasonable.
As has already been explained by our adjudicator as a general rule NatWest isnt obliged to 
continue offering an account to a customer if it doesnt want to  providing banking facilities 
and to who is a commercial decision and not something for me to get involved with.
That being said it wouldnt be fair for NatWest to close Mr Ps account outside the terms and 
conditions of the account or without reasonable notice.
The terms and conditions of the account say that NatWest is able to close an account 
provided it gives 60 days notice. 
I can see that NatWest gave more than the required 60 days notice  180 days - in June 
2022 explaining that his accounts would be closed on 14 January 2023. So Im satisfied 
NatWest was entitled to close Mr Ps account in line with the terms and conditions and that 
no error or mistake has been made. 
I appreciate that this has caused some distress to Mr P and finding a new account to host 
his funds will be an inconvenience. But ultimately NatWest arent obliged to keep offering 
banking facilities and in Mr Ps case it has provided him with three times the notice period it 
has to. So, I dont think it has done anything wrong or treated Mr P unfairly and it follows that 
I do not uphold Mr Ps complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2023.
