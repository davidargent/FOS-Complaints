The complaint
Miss J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) lent to her irresponsibly 
over a number of years by giving her multiple personal loans
What happened
Miss S took out a number of loans with NatWest. Namely in February 2017, twice in August 
2017, in February 2019 and in January 2020. Miss J took out loans prior to these five, and 
she has other lending with NatWest too, but that doesnt form part of this complaint.
Miss J complained that the loans set out above were unaffordable to her and that NatWests 
decision to lend her the money was irresponsible. NatWest disagreed. It said it carried out a 
number of checks to see whether the loans were affordable, and all met their eligibility 
criteria. It said all the loans were approved automatically by its system
Miss J didnt agree and brought her complaint to us. She said NatWest had the ability to 
manipulate or override the system to give out the loans and thinks important information 
such as her benefits wasnt taken into account.
One of our investigators didnt recommend Miss Js complaint be upheld. She thought 
NatWest had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks prior to each loan and 
thought its decision to lend on each occasion was responsible.
Miss J didnt agree and asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding it. I understand Miss J wont be happy with this decision. 
Ill explain my reasoning.
When deciding whether to lend or not, NatWest needs to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure the lending decision is responsible, and that the borrower 
can pay it back without undue difficulty.
In her assessment of Miss Js complaint, our investigator went through each loan in turn 
explaining why she thought NatWest had acted fairly. Ill not be doing that. And I dont mean 
to be discourteous, but I see no benefit in doing so.
Im satisfied that in all the five loans covered by this complaint, NatWest carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks. And Im satisfied its decision to lend was reasonable 
based on the results of those checks. Miss J banked with NatWest, so it had access to her 
accounts and used information from these accounts, along with her previous credit history to 
assess whether it wanted to lend to her.
I appreciate Miss J says this information was manipulated and important information such as 
her benefits wasnt included in the calculations. But other than Miss Js assumption and 
alleged (but unproven) testimony of how NatWest operate, Ive seen nothing to evidence the 
loan applications were manipulated or altered manually. And Im satisfied Miss Js overall 
income was factored into NatWests lending decisions. 
Of the five loans, four were used to consolidate internal borrowing (borrowing already with 
NatWest), and one was used to refinance existing debt. Miss J hadnt missed a payment on 
any previous loans with it, nor did her credit history show any adverse information when the 
loans were taken out.
I appreciate Miss J struggled keeping up with payments on her loan in 2021, but that seems 
to stem from a change in her personal circumstances, and thats not something I can hold 
NatWest accountable for in the scope of this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
