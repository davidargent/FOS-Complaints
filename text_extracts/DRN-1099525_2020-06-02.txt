In its final response to Mr R, MYJAR offered to uphold Mr Rs complaint about loan 5 and it 
offered to refund all the interest and charges he paid on this loan. Mr R didnt accept the 
offer and brought his complaint to this Service. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Rs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because Mr R was showing signs of being in a debt cycle. MYJAR disagreed and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. It said 
there was a significant break in the lending between loans 8 and 9. As the complaint couldnt 
be resolved informally, it was passed to me to issue a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
MYJAR has said there was a significant break in Mr Rs borrowing between loans 8 and 9. 
Looking at the dates, I can see there was a four month break between Mr R repaying loan 8 
and taking out loan 9.  Given the length of time Mr R had been borrowing from MYJAR at this point, I dont think its reasonable consider this a break in the lending. So, I will look at 
Mr Rs borrowing in one chain of lending.  
Our adjudicator didnt think MYJAR needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr R 
didnt disagree with the adjudicators findings about these loans. As there is no dispute with 
these loans, I wont be making any findings on them. But Ive kept these in mind when 
thinking about the context of the overall lending relationship. 
This leaves loans 4 onwards for me to consider. As our adjudicator explained, a 
proportionate check for loan 4 would most likely have shown that Mr R was in a cycle of debt 
and was further borrowing to cover the hole that repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances. This was Mr Rs fourth loan in three months and Mr R had been in debt with 
MYJAR the entire time, with only small breaks between loans. In these circumstances there 
was a risk that by allowing Mr R to take on further loans he wouldnt be able to sustainably 
make the repayments.  
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point MYJAR ought to have realised Mr R was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr R had taken out six loans within nine months. So MYJAR ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his/her finances and that Mr 
Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £550 and he was borrowing it over 
a longer period.  At this point MYJAR ought to have known that it was unlikely that 
  Mr R was not borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but more to 
meet an ongoing need. 
Mr R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 11 was 
taken out nearly three years after Mr Rs first. And it was for a much larger amount. 
Mr R had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over 
an extended period.
 
I think that Mr R lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 11 and MYJAR should put things right.
 
Putting things right  what MYJAR needs to doIn addition to the redress that MYJAR has already agreed to pay for loan 5, it should carry 
out the following: 
refund all interest and charges Mr R paid on loan 4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6 to 11 should be removed from    
Mr Rs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Rs complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2020.
