Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint, concluding  Cashfloat shouldnt have given him 
loans 7 to 10. Cashfloat  disagreed and the case has now been  passed to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Cashfloat had to assess Mr Ms applications  for borrowing to check  if he could afford  to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Cashfloats checks  could have taken into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN09378222But certain factors might  suggest  Cashfloat  should have done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr M. These  factors include:
Mr M having  a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr M having  a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr M coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr M.
Cashfloat was required to establish  whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether he technically had enough  money  to make his repayments.  Having enough  
money to make the repayments could of course  be an indicator that Mr M was able to repay 
his loans sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically  follow that this is the case. The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator thought there were signs Mr M was experiencing financial difficulty  by the 
time he applied  for loan 7. She noted  that he was borrowing similar amounts each time, but 
tended to come back for the next loan very quickly after repaying the most recent  one. 
Having considered Mr Ms pattern of borrowing I agree with our adjudicator. For loans 4 to 7, 
Mr M on average came back for his next loan within a week of paying off the previous one. 
The amounts he borrowed stayed broadly the same, fluctuating between £200  and £350 per 
loan. So it doesnt  seem likely that his underlying situation was improving.  If that had been 
the case then Id have expected to see the amounts he borrowed decreasing over time. 
Cashfloat has noted that Mr M repaid  some  of his loans early  and this doesnt support a 
conclusion he was struggling financially. However  I would point out that early repayment is 
not necessarily a sign of financial health, depending on the rest of the circumstances. Early 
repayment followed by rapid re-borrowing, for example, is suggestive of early  repayment 
having left a hole in the borrowers  finances which further borrowing is then needed to fill. In 
my experience this is not an uncommon  pattern of repayment in borrowers who have an 
underlying reliance on short-term lending, where  they are servicing  multiple loans at the 
same time.
Ref: DRN09378223Ultimately, taking into account what Ive said above,  I think  there were enough warning signs 
in the pattern of Mr Ms borrowing, by the time he applied for loan 7, that his borrowing was 
likely to be unsustainable. I think Cashfloat should  have recognised these signs and stopped 
lending to him at this point.
putting things right
Cashfloat shouldnt  have given Mr M any of loans  7 to 10, so its not right that he should 
have had to pay interest,  fees or charges in relation  to these, or have them affect  his credit 
file in a negative way. 
I think the overall number  of Cashfloat  loans on Mr Ms credit  file is, in itself,  negative 
information caused by its decisions to lend to him when it shouldnt have. So instead  of 
directing Cashfloat  just to remove adverse payment  information in relation to these loans, Im 
going to direct them to remove  the loans entirely.  I appreciate Cashfloat  has some concerns  
about this but I think its the fairest thing to do in the circumstances. So to put things  right I 
direct Cashfloat to:
A)Add together the amount Mr M has paid in interest, fees and charges  on loans 7 to 
10.
B)Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  considered as part of A, 
calculated from the date Mr M originally made the payments to the date the complaint 
is settled.
C)Pay the total of A plus B to Mr M.
D)Remove loans 7 to 10 from Mr Ms credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashfloat to take tax off this interest. Cashfloat must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and direct Western Circle Limited  (trading as Cashfloat) to 
take the actions  outlined  in the putting things right  section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 June 2019.
