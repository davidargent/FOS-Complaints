The complaint
Ms M complains about an online learning course that she paid for using a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Omni Capital Retail Finance Limited.
What happened
Ms M enrolled for an online learning course in May 2021. The price of the course was 
£1,795.50, she paid a deposit of £180 and entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Omni Capital to pay the remaining £1,615.50. She electronically signed the loan agreement 
in June 2021 and she agreed to repay the loan by eleven monthly payments of £134.68 and 
a final payments of £134.62. The loan was interest free.
She had some issues with the course and e-mailed the course provider in September 2021 
to say that she wanted to terminate the finance agreement. She made complaints to Omni 
Capital in September and October 2021 and said that she wanted to cancel the agreement. 
It didnt uphold her complaints so Ms M complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that the loan was mis-sold to Ms M or that there had been a breach of contract by 
the course provider. He said that hed seen no evidence to show that Ms M had cancelled 
the agreement within the cancellation period.
Ms M has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
shes not been treated fairly or impartially;
she phoned the course provider in June 2021 to cancel the course;
the course materials werent accessible and were inaccurate;
Omni Capital hasnt provided her with details of the credit search that it made during 
the application process; and
the course was mis-sold to her and she should receive a refund of the payments that 
shes made to Omni Capital.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
Ms M used a loan from Omni Capital to pay for the course but to be able to uphold 
her complaint about it, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the course provider and that Omni Capitals response to her 
claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the 
outcome of Ms Ms claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Ms M enrolled for the course in May 2021 - Ive not been provided with a copy of the 
enrolment form but the course providers terms and conditions show that she could 
cancel her agreement at any time up to 14 days after the start of the course;
Ms M sent an e-mail to the course provider in June 2021 about some issues with the 
course and she says that she phoned the course provider to cancel the course  but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that she cancelled the 
course at that time;
Ms M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Omni Capital in June 2021 to pay 
for the course  the loan agreement says that she had the right to cancel the 
agreement during the cancellation period which starts on the date of the agreement 
and ends after 14 days;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Ms M tried to cancel the loan agreement during 
the cancellation period and Omni Capital says that it wasnt contacted by Ms M about 
the cancellation of her agreement until September 2021, which was after the 
cancellation period had ended;
Ms M continued to pay for the course but the course provider said in September 
2021 that she hadnt access the course since June 2021;
Ms M says that she wasnt able to access the course materials and that they were 
inaccurate  but the course provider responded to her concerns in September 2021 
(it says that it didnt receive the e-mail that Ms M sent to it in June 2021) and Ms M 
said that the learning experience hadnt been as interactive and interesting as she 
would have expected it to be;
Ms M has had some issues with the course but Im not persuaded that those issues 
are enough to constitute a breach of contract for which Omni Capital would be liable 
under section 75;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the course was 
misrepresented to Ms M or that the course or the loan agreement were mis-sold to 
her;
the terms and conditions of the loan agreement say: In order to process your 
application, we will perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit 
reference agencies  if Ms M wants further information about the credit checks that 
were made by Omni Capital she should contact it but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that it acted incorrectly in connection with any credit 
checks that it made;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Ms M at the time 
that the loan was made to her and nor have I seen any evidence to show that she 
was unduly pressured into enrolling for the course or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the course provider used unacceptable sales practices;
I sympathise with Ms M for the issues that shes had with the course but I consider 
that Omni Capital has responded to her complaints fairly and reasonably in these 
circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it 
has acted incorrectly; andI find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Omni Capital to refund to 
Ms M any of the payments that shes made under the loan agreement, to reduce or 
waive any further payments that are due from her, to pay her any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2022.
