K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs R say Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays) mis-sold Mrs R an Additions packaged 
bank account.  Theyve  used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
The Additions package  was sold while the account  was in Mrs Rs sole name.  Mr R was 
added as a joint party to the account  while the Additions package was active. Our 
adjudicator looked at Mr and Mrs Rs complaint and didnt think the Additions account had 
been mis-sold to Mrs R. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Mrs Rs complaint. 
Ive looked at everything thats been provided  on this complaint. And having done  so, I 
havent seen anything to suggest Mrs R was mis-sold the Additions packaged bank account. 
I think that Mrs R freely  chose to take it and used some of the benefits  such as the 
preferential overdraft terms  and had a need  for others such  as the breakdown cover.  And 
Im open  to the possibility Mrs R wasnt provided  with absolutely everything she shouldve 
been. But I havent seen anything to suggest clearer information  wouldve changed her 
decision to take the account. So, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Rs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  16 February  2019.
