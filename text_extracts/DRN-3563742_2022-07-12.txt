The complaint
Miss S complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc has declined to reimburse the money shes lost to 
a scam.
Whats happened?
Miss S has fallen victim to a cryptocurrency investment scam. She says that a man 
befriended her on a popular social media platform, and, after a while, he suggested that she 
invest in a company which Ill refer to as (A), with his assistance. Between 23 August and   
9 September 2021, Miss S made: 
5 debit card payments from her HSBC current account to a cryptocurrency trading 
account held in her name  totalling £3,314.90.
16 internal transfers from her HSBC ISA to her HSBC current account  totalling 
£76,455.50.
20 faster payments from her HSBC current account to an account she held with a         
third-party bank which Ill refer to as (M)  totalling £78,305.00.
21 debit card payments from her account held with M to a cryptocurrency trading 
account held in her name  totalling £78,340.00.
All of the money paid into her cryptocurrency trading account was invested with A.

Eventually, when Miss S ran out of money, the man stopped contacting her and she realised 
shed been scammed. She reported the matter to HSBC in September 2021. Miss S has 
said that:
She researched A online and it looked legitimate  it had a compelling website with 
24-hour online customer service.
The man was convincing, professional and knowledgeable  he gave her no reason 
to doubt the investment opportunity. She was vulnerable at the time and she believed 
everything he said.
She had no knowledge of these types of scams and didnt have much experience 
with investments.
The first two debit card payments she made to her cryptocurrency trading account 
before making payments to A returned some small dividends, and this convinced her 
of the legitimacy of the investment opportunity.
It was unusual for her to transfer large amounts of money out of her HSBC accounts 
in a short timeframe and/or to drain her accounts.
She wouldnt have proceeded to make the relevant payments if HSBC had told her it 
was likely she was being scammed.
HSBC instigated chargebacks for the two debit card payments Miss S made on 9 September 
2021, which have not been successful, and it has declined to reimburse any of the money 
Miss S has lost to the scam. HSBC has said that: 
None of the faster payments to Miss S account held with M triggered its fraud 
detection systems because they were made to a known payee and looked like 
normal transactions. 
There was no adverse information recorded against A at the time. So, even if it had 
intervened, its unlikely that it wouldve been in a position to prevent the scam.
The faster payments all went to an account held in Miss S own name, so there was 
no loss in this respect. 
The faster payments were transferred from Miss S account with M into a 
cryptocurrency trading account in her own name, held with a well-known investment 
platform. So, theres no reason to believe that an intervention would have had a 
material impact on preventing the scam.
Miss S wasnt happy that HSBC had declined to reimburse her, so she referred a complaint 
about HSBC to this Service. Our investigator considered all of the evidence and upheld Miss S complaint in part. In 
summary, they said that:
Miss S ought reasonably to have done more to protect herself from financial harm in 
the circumstances, so she should bear the responsibility for 50% of her loss. 
The activity on Miss S HSBC accounts was unusual enough from 23 August 2021 
that the bank ought reasonably to have been concerned and intervened to ensure 
that Miss S wasnt at risk of financial harm. 
If HSBC had intervened, the scam would probably have been uncovered. 
HSBC should refund 50% of the debit card transactions to Miss S cryptocurrency 
trading account from and including the £1,400 payment made on 23 August 2021.
M could also have intervened and uncovered the scam, so HSBC should share 
responsibility for the remaining 50% of Miss S loss on money that passed through 
both accounts (the faster payments) with M.
HSBC should refund 25% of the faster payments to Miss S account held with M from 
and including the first £5,000 payment made on 23 August 2021.
HSBC didnt challenge our investigators finding that it should refund 50% of the debit card 
payments to Miss S cryptocurrency trading account from and including the £1,400 payment 
made on 23 August 2021. But it didnt agree with our investigators conclusions in terms of 
the faster payments to Miss S account held with M. It said that:
Customers commonly move funds between their own accounts, and this shouldnt 
routinely be seen as suspicious behaviour.
The faster payments went to an account held in Miss S name with another regulated 
firm, and they didnt go to a new payee. Its not realistic to expect it to have queried 
them. But, even if it had, its unlikely it wouldve disturbed the scam.
The faster payments all went to an account held in Miss S own name, so there was 
no loss.
Miss S complaint has now been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account; relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
It's common ground that Miss S authorised the debit card payments and faster payments. 
She made the payments using the debit card linked to her HSBC current account and online 
banking and, even though she was the victim of a scam, and she didnt intend the payments 
to go to a fraudster, the payments were authorised under the Payment Services 
Regulations. So, the starting point is that HSBC had an obligation to follow Miss S payment 
instructions, and Miss S is presumed liable for her loss in the first instance. But thats not the 
end of the story. There are circumstances in which a bank should make additional checks 
before processing a payment, or in some cases, decline to make a payment altogether, to 
help protect its customers from the possibility of financial harm. I consider that HSBC should:
Have been monitoring accounts and payments made or received to counter various 
risks, including fraud and scams, money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps or made additional checks before processing a payment, or in some 
cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect its customers from the 
possibility of financial harm.
Considering the relatively low values of the debit card payments Miss S made to her 
cryptocurrency trading account on 20 and 22 August 2021, the payment details and Miss S 
prior account activity, I dont think its reasonable to expect HSBCs fraud detection systems 
to have been triggered by them. So, I dont think HSBC couldve done more to prevent these 
particular losses, and it wouldnt be fair or reasonable to require HSBC to refund the 
payments.
Ive thought carefully about what HSBC has said in terms of the other payments made as 
part of this scam and, to an extent, I accept its arguments. In general, I dont think its 
realistic or reasonable to expect a bank to intervene with all high value and/or unusual 
payments made to known payees in isolation. But it should have been on the lookout for 
signs that customers were at risk of fraud, not just for unusual transactions. 
Ive looked at Miss S account statements in the six months leading up to the scam and I 
think that the activity on her accounts as a whole between 23 August and 9 September 2021 
ought reasonably to have caused HSBC some concern. Before the scam, Miss S current 
account was used modestly  in the main, she made very low value payments out of her 
current account (rarely making payments of more than £100 and never making payments of 
more than £500). She was a regular saver and she rarely transferred her savings into her 
current account for general use. But, from 23 August 2021, there was a flurry of activity on 
Miss S accounts. In a short timeframe, her ISA was drained of a substantial savings pot 
following lots of transfers into her current account, and there were lots of high-value 
payments out of the current account (albeit to a known payee). Additionally, there were very 
few transactions occurring on the current account that matched with normal activity. Overall, 
I think the activity on Miss S accounts from 23 August 2021 looks unusual, very suspicious 
and is indicative of fraud. I consider it reasonable to expect HSBC to have intervened in the 
circumstances, to ensure that Miss S did not come to financial harm.
HSBC has argued that the faster payments Miss S made went to her own account held with 
M before being transferred to her own cryptocurrency trading account. So, the loss didnt 
occur on her HSBC accounts. But cryptocurrency scams often involve money passing 
through more than one account and they were not uncommon at the time. I think HSBC 
wouldve been aware of this. The Financial Conduct Authority and Action Fraud published 
warnings about cryptocurrency scams in mid-2018. By mid-2021, when the scam Miss S fell 
victim to started, I think HSBC ought to have had time to digest these warnings and put 
mechanisms in place to detect and prevent this type of fraud. So, although Miss S losses 
may not have arisen from the initial transfers, Im satisfied they ought to have been within the 
contemplation of, and foreseeable to, HSBC. And Im satisfied that HSBC can be held 
responsible for the losses if it could have prevented the scam by asking Miss S some further 
questions about the payments.
It doesnt appear that Miss S was coached by the fraudster, as is often the case with scams, 
so I think she wouldve spoken freely if HSBC had asked her some questions about the   
inter-account transfers and payments she was making on or around 23 August 2021. And I 
think it would most likely have become apparent that she was being scammed.
By August 2021, I think HSBC had or ought to have had a good enough understanding of how cryptocurrency investment scams work  including that customers often move money to 
an account/s in their own name before it is moved on to a fraudster  to have been able to 
identify the risk of harm from fraud. With its industry knowledge, I think HSBC ought to have 
asked Miss S some probing questions and given her information regarding the prevalence 
and typical features of cryptocurrency investment scams before processing the first £5,000 
faster payment out of the current account instructed on 23 August 2021. Miss S has said she 
had no concerns about investing with A because it had a compelling website and she had no 
reason to doubt the fraudster, and thats what she may have said if HSBC had questioned 
her. But I dont think the conversation shouldve stopped there. HSBC couldve asked more 
questions in order to determine whether the typical features of cryptocurrency scams were 
present here (and I think they were  Miss S was investing in A according to the advice 
shed received from a stranger that had contacted her via a social media platform and she 
was passing money through other accounts in her own name before sending money to A). 
And it could have provided meaningful advice about cryptocurrency investment scams.
If HSBC had done enough, I think it would most likely have been obvious to the bank and 
Miss S that there was a risk of financial harm, and the scam wouldve unfolded without any 
of the payments instructed from and including 23 August 2021 being made. Of course, 
HSBC could also have declined to make the payments instructed altogether based on the 
information it had received if Miss S still wanted to go ahead with them despite its warnings 
and, given the circumstances here, I think it wouldve been reasonable for it to do so.
I appreciate that HSBC needs to strike a balance in the extent to which it intervenes in 
payments, against the risk of unduly inconveniencing or delaying legitimate payment 
requests and I wouldnt have expected it to interrogate Miss S. I also acknowledge that the 
main perpetrator here is the fraudster. But overall, I think appropriate questions should 
reasonably have been asked in this case on or around 23 August 2021, and if they had been 
Miss S wouldnt have wanted to go ahead with investing with A, the scam would have 
unravelled and Miss S wouldnt have lost her money.
HSBC hasnt challenged our investigators recommendation to refund the debit card 
payments Miss S made to her cryptocurrency trading account from and including 23 August 
2021, and I think thats a fair position. Considering everything, I think HSBC couldve 
prevented these payments if it had intervened appropriately.
Ive had the benefit of reviewing the evidence presented in Miss S similar case against M, 
and I think it couldve done more to unravel the scam and prevent the loss of funds that 
passed through the account Miss S held with it too (the faster payments). So, overall, I think 
its fair for HSBC and M to share responsibility for these losses, and I have taken a slightly 
different approach to redress than I might normally take considering the individual 
circumstances of this case.
Finally, Ive thought about whether Miss S should bear some responsibility by way of 
contributory negligence. In the circumstances, I think she should bear 50% of the loss she 
incurred from and including 23 August 2021. I say this because Miss S has said that the man 
she met was convincing, professional and knowledgeable, he gave her no reason to doubt 
the investment opportunity and, as she was vulnerable at the time, she believed everything 
he said. Shes also said that she looked at As website and it appeared legitimate. But she 
doesnt seem to have taken any steps to independently verify the legitimacy of the 
investment opportunity before paying over large sums of money. I appreciate that she 
received some small returns from the first two debit card payments she made to her 
cryptocurrency trading account before making payments to A, and that shes said this 
convinced her of the legitimacy of the investment opportunity. But, overall, I dont think she 
did enough to protect herself from financial harm in this case.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct 
HSBC UK Bank Plc to:
Reimburse 50% of the debit card payments Miss S made to her cryptocurrency 
trading account from and including 23 August 2021.
Reimburse 25% of the faster payments Miss S made to her account held with M from 
and including 23 August 2021.
Pay interest from the date of each payment to the date of settlement (at Miss S ISA 
rate on any money that was transferred out of the ISA into her current account before 
being moved on, and at a rate of 8% simple per annum on any funds that were held 
in the current account prior to the scam).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 August 2022.
