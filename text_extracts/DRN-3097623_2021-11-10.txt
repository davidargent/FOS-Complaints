The complaint
 Mr E is unhappy that a car supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with BMW 
Financial Services (GB) Limited trading as BMW Financial Services was of an unsatisfactory 
quality.
What happened
 On 21 December 2019, Mr E was supplied with a new car through a hire purchase 
agreement with BMW. He paid a deposit of £2,000 and the agreement was for £60,022.90 
over 48 months; with 47 monthly repayments of £820.43 and a final optional payment of 
£26,443.70 if Mr E wanted to keep the car. 
Mr E said that, when he collected the car, there were marks on the glass that impaired his 
view while driving. And the car didnt have all of the features he believed it would have. He 
raised this with the supplying dealership at the point of collection, and they unsuccessfully 
tried to polish the marks from the glass. So Mr E arranged to return the car to have the glass 
repaired and the missing features retrospectively fitted.
When driving the car, Mr E also noticed there was a problem with the fuel filler cap, and the 
covers were coming off the seats. Mr E returned the car to the dealership in January 2020 
for repair and was provided with an equivalent courtesy car. The fuel filler cap and the car 
seat covers were repaired, but done the marks on the glass couldnt be polished out, and the 
missing features couldnt be retrospectively added. So Mr E asked to reject the car.
He complained to BMW in February 2020. But BMW said the dealership hadnt been given 
the opportunity to repair the car. So they didnt agree it could be rejected. And, it wasnt until 
June 2020 that the glass in the car was replaced and the car returned to Mr E. Mr E wasnt 
happy with what had happened, and he brought his complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said, from the evidence hed seen, there was a fault with the glass when the 
car was supplied. And because Mr Es vision was impaired while driving the car, this made 
the car of an unsatisfactory quality when supplied. 
The investigator said the dealership had tried unsuccessfully to fix the fault in January 2020 
and, as a result, Mr E asked to reject the car. He said that Mr E had the right to reject after a 
failed repair. And, even though the car had been subsequently repaired against Mr Es 
wishes, Mr E should still have the right to reject.
So the investigator said that BMW should end the agreement and collect the car. They 
should also refund Mr Es deposit, plus interest; remove any adverse entries from Mr Es 
credit file; and pay him £200 for the distress and inconvenience hed been caused.
BMW agreed with the investigator, but Mr E didnt. He said the recommendation was unfair 
as I will not be getting all my payments back [and it] leaves me a a [sic] very minimal 
amount of compensation and without a car.  Because Mr E didnt agree, this matter has 
been passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 On 21 December 2019, Mr E was supplied with a new car through a hire purchase 
agreement with BMW. He paid a deposit of £2,000 and the agreement was for £60,022.90 
over 48 months; with 47 monthly repayments of £820.43 and a final optional payment of

Putting things right
 When looking at whats a fair and reasonable remedy, Im looking to put Mr E back in the 
position he wouldve been in if BMW had allowed him to reject the car after the failed repair 
in January 2020.
If Mr E had rejected the car in February 2020, after he complained to BMW, I wouldve 
expected BMW to refund the deposit he paid. But I wouldnt have expected them to refund 
the payments hed made to that point, as Mr E had use of the car (or an equivalent courtesy 
car) from when it was supplied on 21 December 2019.And Mr E has also either had use of the car, or had use of an equivalent courtesy car, since 
February 2020. So I think its fair that Mr E should also pay for this usage. Its for this reason I 
wont be asking BMW to refund Mr E any of the payments hes made.
Mr E has said that, if he rejects the car now, hell be in a position where he has no car and 
would presumably need to get a new one. But this is the position hed have been in if hed 
been allowed to reject the car in February 2020. And hed have the costs involved in running 
that new car (tax, insurance and finance payments) from February 2020  the same costs as 
hes had to pay for this car since that date. 
So I dont see theres any fundamental difference between the recommendation made by the 
investigator, and the position Mr E wouldve been in if hed rejected the car in February 
2020.
But I appreciate Mr E suffered some frustration and inconvenience because of what had 
happened  he needed to take the car back to the dealership to be repaired, and he was 
without the car he was paying for (albeit with an equivalent courtesy car) for an extended 
period. Ive seen that BMW didnt collect the March 2020 payment of £820.43 because of the 
ongoing issues, and they agreed to the additional £200 recommended by the investigator. 
Which brings the total compensation for the distress and inconvenience Mr E suffered to 
£1,020.43. Given all of the circumstances I think that this is reasonable, and I wont be 
asking BMW to increase this.
So, BMW should now arrange to do the following:
end the agreement with nothing further to pay;
arrange to collect the car, at no cost to Mr E;
remove any adverse information relating to the agreement from Mr Es credit file;
refund the £2,000 deposit Mr E paid;
apply 8% simple yearly interest on the deposit refund, calculated from the date Mr E 
made the payments to the date of the refund ; and
pay Mr E an additional £200 to reflect the trouble and upset hes been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs requires BMW to take off tax from this interest. BMW must give Mr 
E a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
 For the reasons explained, I uphold Mr Es complaint. BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited 
trading as BMW Financial Services must follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2021.
