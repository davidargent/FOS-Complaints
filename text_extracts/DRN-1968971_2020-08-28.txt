The complaint
Miss C says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans At Home (LAH) irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says she couldnt really afford the repayments but LAH still kept lending. She says this 
spiralled out of control until she went into a debt management scheme. 
What happened
This complaint is about 30 home collected loans LAH provided to Miss C between 
September 2014 and October 2017. Ive attached a table below that shows some of the 
information LAH has provided about the lending.

Our adjudicator upheld Miss Cs complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. They thought that LAH shouldve realised, from the pattern of 
lending, that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably and so it wouldnt be right 
to continue to lend to them. LAH didnt respond and so the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Miss C could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Ive considered the pattern of lending up to loan 6 and I think the lending history and pattern 
of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be unsustainable. The 
amounts Miss was borrowing had increased and she had been indebted to LAH for just 
under a year at this point. This showed no signs of changing. So I think LAH was 
irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Putting things right
LAH shouldnt have given Miss C loans 6 to 30.
If LAH has sold any outstanding debts LAH should buy these back if LAH are able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If LAH are not able to buy the debts back then LAH should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss C towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
LAH has already refunded.
B) LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss C 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LAH should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss C as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Miss C having made 
overpayments then LAH should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. LAH should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal LAH may 
have already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Miss C. 
However if there is still an outstanding balance then LAH should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Miss C. LAH shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal LAH has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Miss Cs borrowing for loans 6 to 30 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from Miss Cs 
credit file. LAH do not have to remove any outstanding loans from Miss Cs credit file until 
these have been repaid, but LAH should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax LAH has deducted, if she asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
