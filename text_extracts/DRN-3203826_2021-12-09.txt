The complaint
Mr W is unhappy with Health and Protection Solutions Limited (Towergate) because it didnt 
give him suitable advice when renewing his medical insurance policies.   
What happened
Mr W used a broker from Towergate to renew his policies from 2014  2018. After this, he 
began administering his medical insurance himself. Mr W said that Towergate didnt source 
the most competitive price whilst administering his policies. Mr W said hed been over 
charged because Towergate hadnt discussed particular incentives that wouldve brought 
down the overall cost of those policies. 
Towergate accepted this and said that its adviser hadnt discussed with Mr W that he 
wouldve benefited from having a no claims discount (NCD) applied to his policy at each 
renewal. Towergate, instead, opted for another incentive whereby Mr W received two-
months worth of premiums deducted from the base cost of the policy. It recognised this 
wasnt the better of the two incentives as Mr W would have saved more money having been 
enrolled on the NCD scheme. Towergate offered £1,500 compensation. It initially thought 
that was the amount of money Mr W wouldve saved had Mr W joined the NCD scheme. 
Our investigator agreed that Towergate had made an error and that Mr W had lost out 
financially as a result, but she didnt agree that the compensation offered was fair. She 
suggested that Towergate review its offer in line with the insurers NCD matrix. She 
explained it should rework the figures to determine how much Mr W was owed. The method 
she recommended was to take the base cost of the policy for the corresponding year, apply 
the relevant NCD percentage to establish the cost and compare the difference between that 
figure and what Mr W actually paid that year. She said the difference should be paid to Mr 
W. 
Towergate agreed to do this and has subsequently provided its figures. I know this has been 
shared with Mr W and hes happy to accept this offer. And so, its now for me to make a final 
decision about whether this is fair.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it. My reasons for doing so are the same as those 
already given by the investigator. I agree the offer made by Towergate is fair. Ill explain why. 
Im conscious about over-complicating this decision unnecessarily. And so, Im planning to 
keep this as simple as possible. I agree with the methodology behind the figures because it 
feels fair. 
Towergate accepted that it should have discussed the NCD option with Mr W back in 2014 
and by not doing that, it caused him to miss out on saving money at each subsequent 
renewal. The insurer said that from 2014, Mr W would have been eligible to enrol at 35% 
NCD because of his previous commitment to it. Towergate had taken an advisory role here 
and so it should have shared this information with Mr W clearly so that he could make an 
informed choice about his policy. The NCD scheme was more beneficial to Mr W because it 
offered the same policy but for a cheaper price. The incentive also meant that each year, 
provided Mr W didnt make a claim, the NCD would increase.
Mr W didnt claim during that time and so his NCD grew each year, from 35% in 2014, 40% 
in 2015, 45% in 2016 to 50% from then on. Mr W took over his policy administration from 
2018 where he continued to receive 50% NCD. When the corresponding NCDs were 
applied to the base cost of each policy and compared with what he actually paid for the 
corresponding years, it was clear that Mr W had overpaid for his policies during that time. 
Towergate has been provided with the base cost of each years renewal policy and the 
amount Mr W paid for that year. It must now, retrospectively, rework the figures to determine 
the saving he wouldve made each year, had the NCD been applied to the base cost of the 
policy. It must then work out the difference between those figures to determine how much it 
owes Mr W. Although both sides have accepted that approach, based on the evidence Ive 
seen I dont think Towergate has correctly applied the agreed formula to date. So for the 
avoidance of doubt Ive set out what I consider the correct application of this to be.

£5,540.44
 
The overall difference between the amount Mr W paid for his policy and what he should have 
paid over that timeframe is £5,540.44. Towergate has agreed the above formula was fair and 
so I hope this breakdown helps clarify the amount owed to Mr W. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and Health and Protection Solutions Limited 
must now pay Mr W £5,540.44  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2022.
