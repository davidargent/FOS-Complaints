The complaint
Mr C and Mr W are unhappy with the service they received from National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest) surrounding a request they made via telephone to upgrade an account and 
apply for a mortgage.
What happened
Mr C called NatWest to ask about upgrading an account and applying for a mortgage. The 
NatWest agent that Mr C spoke with told him hed have to apply for the account upgrade 
online, and that it was NatWests policy to only help people aged 70 and over on the 
telephone as it was felt they would be more likely to struggle with the online process. Mr C 
wasnt happy about this and felt that he was being discriminated against because he was 
under the age of 70. So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Cs complaint. They accepted that they should have provided a better 
standard of service to Mr C on the telephone and helped him apply for the account upgrade 
at that time. So, they apologised to Mr C and made a payment of £100 to him as 
compensation for any trouble and upset that hed incurred.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the spirit of NatWests 
response to Mr Cs complaint was commendable, but recommended that NatWest should 
pay a further £50 compensation to Mr C (taking the total amount payable to £150) which 
they felt would more fairly compensate Mr C for the upset this matter had caused.
Mr C and Mr W didnt feel that the recommendation put forwards by our investigator went far 
enough, and so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has accepted that it provided Mr C and Mr W with poor customer service. Mr C and 
Mr W dont see it that way. They believe that what NatWest have done goes beyond poor 
customer service. Theyve felt discriminated against. 
I can understand why Mr C and Mr W feel this way. But I do feel that NatWest have broadly 
understood how their actions have made Mr C and Mr W feel and I note that theyve 
apologised for those actions and issued compensation of £100. And I also note that NatWest 
have accepted our investigators recommendation to make a further compensation payment 
of £50, taking the total compensation amount to £150.
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered as being fair and 
reasonable by one party not being considered as being such by someone else. But the total 
compensation amount of £150 already agreed to by NatWest does feel fair to me here, in 
consideration of all the circumstances. And I can confirm that its commensurate with what I 
would have instructed, had it not been recommended by our investigator.
In their correspondence with this service, Mr C and Mr W have explained that they feel that 
NatWests actions are in breach of the Equality Act 2010 and that theyve therefore acted 
unlawfully. And Im also aware that Mr C and Mr W would like this service to instruct 
NatWest to change its policies as to how telephone requests for account upgrade assistance 
are handled. 
Its not our role to say whether a business has acted unlawfully or not  thats a matter for 
the Courts. Similarly, its also not within our remit to instruct a business to change its 
operational procedures. 
Our role is to decide whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances specific to a 
complaint. To decide that we have to take a number of things into account, including relevant 
law and what we feel constituted good industry practice at the time. So although its for the 
Courts to say whether or not NatWest has breached the Equality Act 2010, were required to 
take the Equality Act 2010 into account, if its relevant, amongst other things when deciding 
whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the complaint.
Having done so, I feel that the acceptance of the poor service and the apology already 
issued by NatWest, as well as the agreement to pay further compensation up to the total 
amount of £150, already represents a fair and reasonable resolution to whats happened 
here. And I dont feel that NatWest should be reasonably instructed to pay any additional 
compensation beyond that amount in this instance.
In arriving at this position Ive considered the impact of NatWests actions on Mr C and Mr W 
as theyve described it, as well as NatWests acceptance of the negative impact of their 
actions and the apology that theyve issued to Mr C and Mr W for them.
All of which means that while I accept that Mr C and Mr W may not agree with my position 
and may continue to feel that additional compensation is merited here, it follows that I wont 
be instructing NatWest to pay any further compensation beyond the total amount of £150 to 
which theyve already agreed.
It follows then that while I will be upholding this complaint in Mr C and Mr Ws favour, Ill be 
doing so only on the basis that NatWest must make the further £50 compensation payment 
to which theyve previously agreed to pay. I realise this wont be the outcome Mr C and Mr W 
were wanting, but I hope theyll understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the 
final decision that I have.
Putting things right
NatWest must make a further payment of £50 to Mr C and Mr W, taking the total amount of 
compensation paid to £150.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mr W to 
accept or reject my decision before 25 August 2022.
