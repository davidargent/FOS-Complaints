The complaint
Miss G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wouldnt give her a refund for an item 
which she says was counterfeit. Miss G said PayPal insisted that the item was returned to an 
overseas address, but it was too expensive to send it back.
What happened
Miss G said she made a purchase using PayPal, of an item costing £349:99, in late 2019. 
She said that when the item arrived she tried to register it for a guarantee, and found that it 
was a counterfeit item. Miss G said she thought shed be covered because shed bought the 
item using PayPal, and a credit card. 
Miss G said that in February 2020 she was informed by PayPal that she had to return the 
item at her own cost, to an overseas address. She said this would cost her £90. 
Miss G said PayPal told her she could, alternatively, raise the issue with her card company. 
She said it took some time to get a response from her card company. It offered to pay the 
postage as a goodwill gesture, but PayPal then said that her claim had been closed. 
Miss G said she was the victim of fraud, and didnt think that what had happened was fair. 
She told us about the effect the pandemic had on her income. She felt shed endured poor 
treatment, which had greatly affected her mental well-being. She wanted us to get her 
money back for her. 
PayPal said Miss G sent a payment of £349.99 on 25 November 2019. On 21 January 2020 
she filed a dispute, saying that the item hadnt been received. But PayPal said that the seller 
provided tracking information, which showed that the item had been delivered. So it didnt 
uphold her complaint. 
PayPal said Miss G then opened a dispute claiming that the goods shed received were 
significantly not as described. PayPal said that it had asked Miss G to return the item, but 
she hadnt done so. For that reason, her claim was denied. 
PayPal said it had paid Miss G £50 as a gesture of goodwill, but it didnt think it had done 
anything wrong. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said PayPal had followed 
the process set out in its rules, and he thought it had acted fairly and reasonably. So he said 
he wouldnt ask PayPal to do anything else.
Miss G said that she had been away from home for some of the time that PayPal gave her to 
return the goods. She said that she thought she was protected by dealing with PayPal and 
using a credit card, but shed been left out of pocket. And she said that she had no 
guarantee that a refund would be made if she had returned the goods. But our investigator 
didnt change his mind. He said that PayPals buyer protection is clear that Miss G may have 
to return the item at her own cost.
Miss G said that if PayPal had told her that returning the item would guarantee a refund, 
then it would have been returned, despite the cost. Miss G wanted her complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons.
Broadly speaking, consumer protection law in the UK applies between the buyer and seller 
of goods. But here, Miss G was asking PayPal to intervene, to help her. When PayPal does 
that, it acts under the terms of the agreement its reached with Miss G. Those terms contain 
a buyer protection policy.
When PayPal investigated Miss Gs second claim for the item shed purchased, it asked her 
to return it. Im satisfied that PayPals buyer protection policy does set out that it will refund 
the purchase price and shipping costs that a buyer has paid to receive an item, but it wont 
cover the cost of returning the goods. So I think PayPal acted in line with its policies when it 
said Miss G should return the item, and it wouldnt cover that cost.
Miss G has told us that if PayPal had guaranteed she would get her money back, then she 
would have sent it back. But I think that PayPal did tell Miss G that she would get a refund, if 
she returned the item. Its email to Miss G begins with 
After reviewing your case, weve determined that you are eligible for a refund of 
£349.99. To receive your refund, you need to: 
The email goes on to set out that the item needs to be returned, to the address PayPal had 
provided. So I think that PayPal did confirm that Miss G would receive a full refund of the 
amount she spent, if she returned the item. 
I think that PayPal was also clear that there was a time limit on its offer of a refund. The 
email it sent Miss G also said 
Remember, you need to send the item and provide online tracking information in the 
Resolution Centre before 9 March 2020.  If we dont hear from you before the 
deadline, the claim will be closed and you wont receive a refund.
Miss G sent us this email too, so it does look like she received it. Miss G has told us that she 
was out of the country for some of the time that PayPal gave her to return the item, but she 
hasnt shown our service that she was prevented from returning the item as a result of this. 
And, having asked PayPal for sight of all of its communications with Miss G, I havent been 
able to see that she asked for extra time to send the item back. 
So I dont think it was unreasonable or unfair for PayPal to close this claim when it hadnt 
received a response from Miss G by the deadline it set. 
I have considered carefully what Miss G has told us, but I dont think that PayPal has been 
unfair or unreasonable in this case. Like our investigator, I think PayPal has applied its own 
buyer protection policy in this case, and acted fairly and reasonably. And so, although I know 
Miss G will be disappointed, I dont think her complaint should be upheld.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
