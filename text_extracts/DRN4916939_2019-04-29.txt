K822xcomplaint
Mr Ds unhappy that NewDay  Ltd sold his account  to a third party.
 
background 
Mr D says he agreed with NewDay to make six monthly £100 payments to get his credit card 
account back within its limit. But in the fourth month he found out his account wasnt 
accessible, had been suspended and was about to be sold to a third party.  He says NewDay 
agreed to credit his account with £10 as he mayve been misled.  Hes unhappy with the way 
NewDay has dealt with him as he was making  the agreed payments.  He wants  it to take 
back his account  and honour  the agreement. Hes also unhappy that this will have given him 
a bad credit  rating. And he says its affected his health.
NewDay said in its final response that Mr D was keeping to the agreed  payments but it 
preselected his account for sale to a third party, as it reserved the right to do. This was 
because his account was in arrears  and original agreement had been breached. Itd credited 
£10 to Mr Ds account. It subsequently  accepted that its agent had given Mr D misleading  
advice and this had caused  him distress. It offered to pay him £100 for this.
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld.  She said:
NewDay has said Mr D agreed  to a hardship  plan. Its agent  shouldve  told him that 
the payment arrangement would be reported to credit reference agencies, that 
provided the arrangement is maintained arrears will not accrue and that even if 
payments are made  the account may still be sold. NewDay accepts its agent failed to 
do so and itd made  an error.  
Even so NewDay was within its rights to sell the account to a third party as Mr D was 
in breach of his original credit agreement. Its also said it cannot repurchase  the debt 
from the third party as that would automatically charge it off and wipe it out which 
would mean his credit record would  inaccurately reflect the situation.  
The third party will apparently continue  with the original payment arrangement. 
NewDay also says Mr D didnt have the use of his credit card and selling the debt 
hasnt changed  that or negatively affected his credit file. Mr D also hasnt been  
financially disadvantaged by NewDays error.  NewDays offer of compensation is in 
line with what we would  recommend and she wont be asking it to do anymore.
Mr D remains  unhappy and has asked  for an ombudsman review.  In summary hes unhappy 
that hes been told by the third party that it will record a default  on his credit file. He agreed 
to pay NewDay to avoid  this happening.  But this level of payment isnt affordable  for him. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN49169392I agree  with the investigator that NewDay was entitled to sell Mr Ds account  and debt if it 
wished to even  if he was maintaining his agreed  repayments  as he had breached the terms 
of his original credit  agreement by the time these repayments were agreed.
It doesnt appear that sale of Mr Ds account and debt to the third party has negatively  
impacted his credit record as he feared.  The third party wouldve apparently  also kept to the 
repayments he agreed with NewDay. But when they end it will be up to the third party and 
Mr D to come to an agreement for the repayment of what remains outstanding. I also note 
why NewDay says it cannot buy back the account  and debt from the third party.
Its clear NewDays agent couldve advised  Mr D better and its accepted  it made an error.  As 
Mr D doesnt appear  to have been  disadvantaged  financially  and as his credit file seems not 
to have been adversely affected by this error,  I think  its fair for NewDay  to compensate  Mr D 
just for any distress and inconvenience he experienced as a result of its error. NewDay  has 
already credited £10 to Mr Ds account  and has recently offered to pay him an additional 
£100 for this. 
Taking every thing into account,  including the level of awards  we make,  I think  thats fair. 
And I dont  think I can reasonably ask NewDay to do or pay anything more as Mr D would 
like. I simply leave it to Mr D to decide if he now wishes  to accept NewDays offer of an 
additional £100 compensation.
Its unfortunate if Mr D feels the third party isnt abiding by what NewDay agreed and that 
hes unhappy its said it may record a default on his credit file. But the default doesnt  appear 
to be related to the fact the account  was sold to the third party.  These are now matters 
between Mr D and the third party. And theyre not something I can consider in this complaint. 
If Mr D remains  unhappy with the way the third party is dealing with him or responding to his 
financial difficulties he should  raise his concerns with the third party in the first instance.
Overall, although I recognise  Mr Ds frustration and strength of feeling, I dont see any 
compelling reason  to change the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2019.
