The complaint
Ms B complains that NewDay Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.  
What happened
In November 2016, Ms B applied to NewDay for a retailer branded credit card. NewDay 
approved Ms Bs application and agreed a credit limit of £1,000. In or around August 2017, 
NewDay increased Ms Bs credit limit to £1,400.
In November 2017, Ms B applied to NewDay for an Aqua branded credit card. NewDay 
approved Ms Bs application and agreed a credit limit of £250.
NewDay increased the limit on Ms Bs Aqua card on four occasions between February 2019 
and May 2020 to a peak total of £4,100. NewDay also increased the limit on the retailer 
branded card on three occasions between May 2019 and March 2021 to a total of £3,150.
In May 2021, Ms B complained to NewDay about the credit card limits theyd given her. She 
said that when NewDay agreed the new card in 2017, she couldnt afford the repayments 
and was struggling financially. She said the credit limit increases had resulted in huge 
amount of interest and fees which made her financial position worse. Ms B said this resulted 
in her entering a debt management plan in 2020. She wanted NewDay to apologise for their 
mistakes and refund interest and fees.
NewDay responded to Ms Bs complaint in July 2021. They didnt agree theyd done 
anything wrong when they approved her applications for both credit cards. They also didnt 
agree theyd acted inappropriately when they subsequently increased her credit limits. They 
said their decisions were in line with their policy and theyd completed proportionate checks.
NewDay upheld Ms Bs complaint about a credit limit increase to £3,150 on her retailer 
branded card in March 2021. They refunded fees of £9 and interest of £11.86.  But Ms B 
wasnt happy with NewDays response. So, she referred her complaint to this service. She 
said shed been exceeding her credit limits and completing gambling transactions. She was 
also only paying the minimum payments and regularly missing or applying late payments. 
Ms B also said shed held many payday loans and believes NewDay shouldve noticed this 
from her credit file.
Having considered all the information, our investigator thought Ms Bs complaint should be 
upheld in part. He thought NewDays original decisions to approve both Ms Bs credit card 
applications were reasonable. He also thought NewDays decisions to increase limits on her 
account prior to April 2019 were also reasonable, based upon the information they had 
available. 
But our investigator didnt think NewDay had acted responsibly when they decided to 
increase Ms Bs credit limits from April 2019 onwards. He thought the information NewDay 
had available was sufficient to prompt them to complete further checks and tests. And had 
they, our investigator believed NewDay wouldnt have increased Ms Bs limits further.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigators findings. They said information about Ms Bs 
other debts werent available to them when they agreed to increase her limit in April 2019. 
They also said there was evidence that problems Ms B was experiencing in 2018 had been 
resolved and her accounts were managed well prior to them increasing her limit. NewDay 
said there was no evidence of recent payday loans when they offered to increase her limit.
NewDay said that all subsequent limit increases were provided having considered all internal 
and external financial information available in line with their internal lending policy.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Ms Bs complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
In doing so, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I 
issues a provisional decision on 10 August 2022  giving both Ms B and NewDay the 
opportunity to respond to my findings below before I reach a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable or irresponsible lending complaints on 
our website and Ive considered this when deciding Ms Bs complaint.
The rules and regulations in place throughout NewDays lending relationship with Ms 
B required them to carry out an assessment of whether she could afford to repay 
what she owed in a sustainable manner. Any such assessment needed to be 
borrower focused, meaning they should focus on the affordability of repayments 
and the potential for adverse financial impact on Ms B, rather than on the likelihood 
the credit would be repaid. Any assessment needed to be proportionate to the 
circumstances.
For clarity, Ill refer to each card and account as follows:
The retailer branded credit card  Card 1
The Aqua credit card  Card 2
As both cards were provided by NewDay, I would expect them to have had access to 
information on the operation of both accounts in addition to external information 
available when considering any credit decision.
Card 1 - initial credit limit
Ms Bs original application in November 2016 showed she had an income of £19,500 
and unsecured debts of £1,200. There were no reported arrears or defaults or any 
other adverse information on her credit file. So, I think NewDays decision and the 
credit limit agreed of £1,000 was reasonable here.
Card 1  limit increase to £1,400
This was offered eight months after the original application. Ms B had made some 
cash withdrawals from the account. The Lending Standards Board (LSB) Lending 
code suggests that making frequent cash withdrawals on a credit card at a non-
promotional rate of interest may be a sign of financial difficulties. That said, I dont 
think there were any other warning signs. Ms B hadnt exceeded her limit, hadnt 
missed or been late with payments and there was nothing adverse reported on her 
credit file. So, I think NewDays decision to increase Ms Bs credit limit was 
reasonable here.
Card 2  initial credit limit
Ms Bs application in November 2017 showed she had an income of £20,000 and 
unsecured debts of £3,800. There were no reported arrears, defaults or other 
adverse information on her credit file. But, having looked at the account for Card 1, 
Ms B had made 24 cash withdrawals up to, and including, November 2017. Further, 
her repayment direct debit was returned unpaid in October 2017 and shed exceeded 
her limit as a result. Ive also reviewed the statements for Card 1. I can see there 
were at least 15 transactions of a gambling and gaming nature since NewDay had 
increased the limit on that account.
While the initial limit of £250 may have been low, I think there were sufficient warning 
signs to give NewDay cause to undertake further checks and tests to verify Ms Bs financial situation. But I cant see they did that here. So, I need to consider whether 
such checks would, more likely than not, have revealed that agreeing to provide a 
second credit card account could suggest Ms B may have been unable to sustainably 
repay her borrowings. Having considered the evidence together with Ms Bs 
testimony, Im persuaded that further checks wouldve revealed that her financial 
situation, at the time, was potentially unstable giving cause to the types of transaction 
seen. So, I dont believe NewDays decision to provide another credit card was 
appropriate here.
Card 2 - limit increase to £1,250
This increase was offered by NewDay in or around February 2019. The information 
available to them showed that since December 2017, Ms B had regularly been taking 
out payday loans. By the time NewDay agreed to increase her Card 2 limit in 
February 2019, 21 active payday loan accounts were reported. In addition, the 
reported debt balances had peaked at more than £12,000, albeit reduced to around 
£5,800 by February 2019. 
I think its also relevant that Card 1 showed a sustained period of limit excesses 
between October 2017 and August 2018 together with late payments. I accept that 
these appear to stop from August 2018. But again, I believe there were sufficient 
warning signs to give NewDay cause to undertake further checks, tests and 
verifications. And I cant see that happened here. I remain persuaded that such 
checks wouldve likely revealed information that might lead NewDay to conclude that 
any additional borrowing might be unsustainable.
Subsequent limit increases
Moving forward, I cant see that NewDay considered further checks and verification 
for any of the subsequent limit increases. Even when Ms Bs overall borrowings 
increased to more than £25,000 and despite further late payments and limit 
excesses.
In summary, I believe NewDays decisions up to, and including, the Card 1 limit 
increase in August 2017 were reasonable. But in circumstances where the 
information suggests a consumers finances are likely to be less stable, its far more 
likely that an affordability assessment will need to be more detailed and contain a 
greater degree of verification, in order for it to be fair, reasonable and proportionate. 
And as Ive stated, given the warning signs Ive found, I think that was the case here. 
Im also persuaded that proportionate checks would likely have shown the credit 
wasnt sustainably affordable. So, I intend to reflect this in my decision.
Ms B has received benefit from the money she borrowed, so its fair that she remains 
liable for any remaining amount outstanding. But I intend to instruct NewDay to 
refund interest and charges to Ms Bs Card 1 account for any amount borrowed over 
and above the limit of £1,400. In the event that the refunded interest and charges 
result in a surplus balance falling due to Ms B, then NewDay should also add interest 
of 8% simple to this figure.
Given that I also believe NewDays decision to provide Card 2 was inappropriate, I 
intend to ask them to refund all charges and interest on this account too. Again, in 
the event that the refunded interest and charges result in a surplus balance falling 
due to Ms B, then NewDay should also add interest of 8% simple to this figure.Finally, I dont believe that its fair or reasonable for Ms Bs credit file to be adversely 
impacted by NewDays decisions. So, once the outstanding balances have been 
repaid, I intend to instruct NewDay to remove any related adverse information 
reported from Ms Bs credit file.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
NewDay confirmed they had nothing further to add. Ms B also confirmed that she is happy to 
accept my findings. So, as Ive not been provided with any new information or comments, I 
have no reason to vary from my provisional decision.
Ms B has told this service that NewDay have cancelled her accounts with them and 
confirmed that the retailer branded card account has been referred to a debt recovery 
service. Ms B also said that she no longer has access to her Aqua card account but hasnt 
received any notification of whether this has also been referred. Ms B is concerned how the 
proposed redress would be affected by this development. 
At this stage its unclear whether NewDay have simply passed over responsibility for 
recovery of the outstanding debt(s) or whether the debt(s) have been sold. So, I will address 
this within my final decision below.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Ms Bs complaint.
I require NewDay Ltd to settle as follows:
Refund all charges and interest relating to any balance owed above the limit of 
£1,400 on Card 1.
Refund all charges and interest on Card 2.
If an outstanding balance remains owed once the refunds have been made, NewDay 
should contact Ms B to discuss a suitable repayment plan.
If the effect of refunding all interest, fees and charges leaves a credit balance on 
either account, the balance should be treated as overpayments and returned to Ms B 
along with 8% interest from the date they were made until the date of settlement.
Amend Ms Bs credit file to reflect the new monthly balances after refund of interest 
and charges.
Remove any related adverse information from Ms Bs credit file once the outstanding 
balances have been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.In the event that NewDay has sold the debt to a third party, they should arrange to either buy 
back the debt from the third party or liaise with them to ensure the redress set out above is 
carried out promptly.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2022.
