The complaint
Mr H complains that he didnt take out loans from Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays).
What happened
Mr H took out a series of loans from Barclays between 2007 and 2016. There were a series 
of refinances  existing loans were repaid and new ones opened. In August 2016, the final 
loan of £8,700 was set up  to be repaid over 60 months.
Mr H complained that he didnt borrow the money. He said he only took out loans for £5,000 
in May 2014, £1,000 in June 2015 and £1,000 in August 2016. So  he shouldve paid 
everything off by now.
Barclays said there had been 11 loans agreed between 2007 and 2016. Each one was 
properly set up with loan agreements, including the terms and conditions and a 14-day 
cooling off period.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclays had acted reasonably. She 
set out what had happened  and each loan from 2007 onwards had been repaid by taking 
out a new loan for a higher amount  meaning that Mr H was topping up the loan each 
time. The last loan was arranged in August 2016 for £8,700  for 60 months ending in 
August 2021. 
Mr H asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H is concerned that he shouldnt still be in debt with his last loan of £8,700. He thinks he 
only took three loans between 2014 and 2016  totalling £7,000. And as they were for three 
years, they should be repaid by now.
Ive looked at what has happened. Weve gone back to loans taken out from 2007 to 2016. 
Each one was repaid by a new loan, with an additional amount being topped up each time. 
So  I can see how Mr H may have lost track of what happened. Ive gone through Mr Hs 
loan statements and loan agreements and can see that each time, the loan was properly set 
up. And I can see how the loan was repaid and topped up. It can be seen from the table 
below that each time, a net payment of money was paid into Mr Hs current account  after 
the old loan was repaid. So, this was the new amount borrowed each time.
To clearly show what happened, I am setting out the schedule of loans and amounts repaid 
and lent:

Mr H has raised a particular question about the loan in March 2014  he doesnt recall doing 
this. But Ive looked at Barclays records here. Mr H took a loan for £6,700 in March 2014. It 
was drawn down. He then went back to Barclays a few days later and said he wanted to buy 
a trailer for £600. So, they closed the original loan and added to it  giving Mr H a new loan 
of £7,400 on 20 March 2014.
I do hope this clarifies the situation for Mr H.
So  I can see that Barclays acted fairly and reasonably, and I wont be asking them to do 
anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
