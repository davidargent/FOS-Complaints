K821x#15complaint
Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 16 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr G between  November 
20016 and February 2019.  Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows:
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 8 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Gs borrowing indicated  he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  Sunny disagreed  but 
offered to uphold the complaint from loan 11 onwards. Mr G declined Sunnys offer.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers Loan Date Taken

Ref: DRN16295652income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
There was a significant break in Mr Gs borrowing  from Sunny. There was a gap of around 
seven months between loans 2 and 3. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view this 
gap as an indication  that Mr Gs finances had stabilised during this time. So, I will look at Mr 
Gs borrowing in two separate lending chains. Chain one being  loans 1 and 2 and chain two 
being loans 3 to 16. Ive carefully  considered  all the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided in this context  and what  this all means  for Mr Gs complaint. Having done  so, I am 
partially upholding the complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Gs complaint  about loans 1 to 7. Mr G hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
In reaching my decision, Ive looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with    
Mr G, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  Sunny should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny should  have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN16295653Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 8. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out eight loans in just under four months  and often had 
more than one loan already running  with Sunny.  So, it should  have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  16 was 
taken out two years and four months  after Mr Gs first. Mr G had paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr G towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr G which  were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr G originally made  
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr G as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr G having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr G. However,  if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr G. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
Ref: DRN16295654E) The overall pattern  of Mr Gs borrowing for loans 8 to 16 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so Sunny  should  remove these loans entirely from Mr Gs credit  file. 
Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Gs credit file until these 
have been repaid, but Sunny should  still remove any adverse information  recorded about 
these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
