The complaint
Mr M complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with a transfer 
request.
What happened
Mr M holds an account with NatWest and lives abroad. In October 2019 he asked NatWest 
to pay a bill of £3210 to a UK based bank account held by someone else. He also asked it to 
transfer £200000 to his overseas bank account. NatWest asked Mr M to fax his request to it, 
which he did. And it discussed the option of internet banking with him so he could complete 
his transaction online. 
Mr M wasnt set up for online banking. So, NatWest needed to send him a code. However, 
the code didnt work so Mr M wasnt able to transfer his money via internet banking.
When NatWest received Mr Ms faxed request it declined to transfer his funds. It said it 
attempted to contact Mr M twice on 11 October and once on 14 October 2019 to discuss his 
transfer request and compete security checks. But it was unable to reach him on the number 
it held on his customer profile. It therefore couldnt complete Mr Ms payment requests and 
his instruction was automatically cancelled. A fraud restriction was also placed on Mr Ms 
account. NatWest said it sent Mr M an email confirming this.
On 15 October 2019 Mr M spoke with NatWest and was offered a number of options in 
relation to how he could transfer his funds. But it said Mr M indicated that none of those 
options were suitable. As this transfer was time sensitive Mr M therefore decided to travel to 
the UK in order to transfer his funds, which caused him to incur significant travel expenses. 
On around 17 October 2019 Mr M attended a NatWest branch in order to make his transfer. 
He said NatWest told him his funds had been successfully transferred. But when he returned 
overseas, he discovered this was incorrect. He therefore returned to the UK in December 
2019 in order to resolve the issues surrounding his payment. 
On around 12 December 2019 Mr M attended a NatWest branch and was able to 
successfully complete the transfer. But he incurred additional travelling expenses as a result 
of this attendance.
Mr M wasnt happy with what had happened. He felt the way hed been treated by NatWest 
was unfair. So, he complained. When NatWest responded to Mr Ms complaint it explained 
that it hadnt been able to transfer his money as a result of it following its internal security 
process. And, as it had offered options as to how he could transfer his money, it wasnt 
willing to reimburse the expenses Mr M incurred in travelling to the UK.
Being dissatisfied with NatWests response to his complaint Mr M referred it to our service. 
Our investigator looked into it and thought NatWest had dealt with his complaint fairly. So 
they didnt recommend upholding it. But Mr M disagreed and asked for her complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware that Ive summarised the events of the complaint. I dont intend any discourtesy by 
this - it just reflects the informal nature of our service. Ive concentrated on what I think are 
the key issues. I can assure Mr M and NatWest that Ive read everything that theyve 
provided. So, if Ive not mentioned something its not because I havent considered it. Its just 
that I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is a fair and 
reasonable outcome.
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr M experienced here. I can appreciate that he was 
caused distress and inconvenience by what happened, which was exacerbated by the fact 
that he was abroad and therefore unable to attend a NatWest branch without significant 
disruption and expense. But, despite my natural sympathy about that, the issue here is 
whether I think NatWest made a mistake, or treated Mr M unfairly, such that it needs to now 
put things right. And, having thought carefully about everything he and NatWest have said, 
Im afraid to say that I dont think it did. Ill explain why.
Ill focus first on NatWests decision to subject Mr Ms payment transfer to a fraud check. I 
appreciate this payment was authentic. But banks have a duty to have robust strategies to 
safeguard customer accounts from potentially fraudulent transactions and scams. Preventing 
fraud and protecting customers is as important for the bank as it is for its customers. To do 
so a bank may subject payments to a security check as NatWest did here.
I understand that when NatWest declined to make Mr Ms transfers it was an inconvenient 
and frustrating experience. He needed to pay a bill urgently and, understandably, he wanted 
to transfer money in his account that was available for him to use as he wanted. 
However, based on the evidence Ive seen. Im satisfied NatWest had reason to suspect 
these transactions werent authentic  at one of the transactions was a very high value 
transfer and it was out of character when compared to historical account transactions. So, I 
can understand why NatWest had cause to be vigilant and have concerns about the 
authenticity of the payments instructions it received. 
As I set out in the background to this complaint NatWest attempted to contact Mr M on 11 
and 14 October 2019 in order to discuss his transfer requests. It also sent him an email 
explaining what had happened. 
Mr M disputes NatWest attempted to contact him by telephone. But Ive seen contact 
records that were completed contemporaneously by NatWest, which confirm the efforts it 
made to reach him telephone. Im satisfied NatWests records show it made reasonable 
efforts to contact Mr M as our service would expect. And thats evidence I have to take into 
account when reaching a decision here.
When NatWest was unable to reach Mr M over the telephone it cancelled his transfer 
requests. NatWest said this is done automatically where it cant complete its security checks 
as part of its policy in relation to how it deals with payments it suspects may be fraudulent. 
I appreciate Mr M is unhappy that his payment instruction was cancelled  its clear that 
caused him substantial upset and inconvenience. But NatWest is entitled to determine its 
own policy in relation to how it deals to potentially fraudulent payments. And our service 
cant comment on whether a business policy is right or tell it that its policy should be changed. Impartially though Im satisfied NatWest adhered to its procedures. And I think the 
action it took was a reasonable precaution for it to adopt.
In the overall circumstances of this complaint, Im not persuaded that NatWest made an 
error in how it dealt with Mr Ms payment requests. The terms and conditions of his account 
entitle NatWest to decline to make payments it suspects to be fraudulent. They also permit 
NatWest to restrict a customers account where it feels thats necessary in their best 
interests.
Here, Im satisfied NatWest was simply trying to safeguard Mr Ms account from potential 
fraud. So, taking everything into consideration, I cant fairly conclude that the way in which it 
responded was unreasonable in the circumstances.  
Ill turn now to the travel expenses Mr M incurred in travelling to the UK twice in order to 
attend a branch for the purposes of resolving the issues surrounding his transfers. 
I recognise that Mr M felt he had no option but to travel to the UK twice. But NatWest has 
shown our service cogent evidence to demonstrate that it gave Mr M alternative options that 
would resolve the issues surrounding his transfers without requiring him to travel to the UK.
Ive seen evidence of the travel expenses Mr M incurred in attending NatWest branches 
during his visits to the UK. But I think it was Mr Ms choice to travel to the UK in order to 
attend a branch. NatWest didnt tell him to do this. And it had presented alternative ways of 
proceeding with his transfer, which would have enabled Mr M to mitigate his costs. It follows 
that I cant fairly ask it to reimburse his travel expenses in the overall circumstances of this 
complaint.
I understand Mr M feels very strongly about the issues raised in his complaint and Im not 
seeking to downplay the difficulties or frustrations he had here  far from it. But for the 
reasons already outlined, I think NatWest has dealt with this complaint fairly and done all it 
can to resolve this dispute. 
I realise Mr M will be disappointed with this decision. But it brings to an end what we, in 
trying to resolve his dispute with NatWest informally, can do for him.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 September 2020.
