The complaint
Mrs S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd provided her with a credit account which she feels was
unaffordable for her at that time. Mrs S is also unhappy that NewDay increased the credit
limit on her account on several occasions, all of which she feels were unaffordable for her at
those times.
What happened
Mrs S applied for a NewDay credit account in January 2019. NewDay approved Mrs Ss
application and she was issued with a credit card with an initial credit limit of £900.
In June 2019, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mrs Ss account from £900 to £2,150.
Further credit limit increases took place in September 2019, February 2020, November
2020, and March 2021, by which time the credit limit on Mrs Ss account had been increased
to £8,000.
In April 2021, Mrs S raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that she felt that she
hadnt been able to afford the credit that had been provided to her, and that NewDay should
have recognised this before issuing the credit and then increasing the amount of credit
available to her.
NewDay looked at Mrs Ss complaint. But they felt that theyd undertaken checks into Mrs
Ss financial position before approving her for credit and before increasing the credit limit on
her account, and that in all instances thered been nothing resulting from these checks that
should have given them cause to suspect that the credit being offered to Mrs S wasnt
affordable for her at those times. So, they didnt uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Mrs S wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the information that
NewDay had assessed when Mrs S had first applied for the credit account, including
information provided to NewDay by Mrs S, was such that it hadnt been unreasonable for
NewDay to have approved Mrs Ss application for credit at that time.
However, our investigator didnt feel that NewDay had undertaken reasonable and
proportionate checks into Mrs Ss financial position before theyd increased the credit limit on
her account, and they also felt that if NewDay had undertaken such checks that it was more
likely than not that NewDay should have concluded that Mrs S might not be able to afford the
additional credit under consideration, such that the credit limit increases shouldnt have been
implemented. Our investigator therefore recommended that this complaint be upheld in Mrs
Ss favour for this reason.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 30 December 2021 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of 
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit, the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that 
any credit being offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
With regard to Mrs Ss initial application for credit, NewDay appear to have done that 
here. They took details from Mrs S of her annual income and employment status, and 
they obtained additional information about Mrs Ss wider financial position from a 
credit reference agency. And, having considered this information, Im satisfied that it 
was reasonable for NewDay to have approved Mrs Ss application for credit and to 
have issued her with a credit card with an initial credit limit of £900.
However, Im not convinced that NewDay took reasonable and proportionate steps to 
ensure that the subsequent credit limit increases that they offered to Mrs S were 
affordable for her before they were implemented.
One reason I say this is because, at the time of the initial credit application, Mrs S 
had an annual income of £7,000. Additionally, given that Mrs S was retired, its 
unlikely that her level of income would have increased. Furthermore, at the time of 
the initial credit application, Mrs Ss credit file confirmed that Mrs S had other existing 
debt totalling £2,400.
As such, while I feel that its more likely than not that Mrs S would have been able to 
afford the potential repayments that might become due on an account with a £900 
credit limit, Im not convinced that NewDay did enough to confirm that Mrs S would 
have been able to afford the potentially higher repayments that may have become 
due following NewDay increasing the credit limit on her account to £2,150, which 
NewDay did in June 2019.
NewDay contend that they did undertake checks into Mrs Ss ability to afford the 
additional credit being offered to her before implementing any credit limit increases, 
and these checks included reviewing how Mrs S had managed her account in the 
months leading up to a credit limit increase, and also a review of updated information 
obtained from a credit reference agency to refresh their understanding of Mrs Ss 
wider financial position.
However, while I acknowledge that, in the months immediately preceding the first 
credit limit increase in June 2019, there was nothing in how Mrs S had managed her 
NewDay account which might suggest that she was struggling to afford the 
repayment or that she was in financial difficulty, it is evident from the information 
obtained from the credit reference agency at that time that Mrs Ss total amount of 
other credit had increased to approximately £3,900, which was over half of Mrs Ss 
previously declared annual income of £7,000.
This means that by increasing the credit limit on Mrs Ss account by a further £1,250,
NewDay were increasing Mrs Ss total level of potential indebtedness to a level that I 
feel may have been unsustainable for Mrs S.It's also evident that NewDay didnt contact Mrs S at the time that they were 
proposing increasing the credit limit on her account to confirm with her directly that 
her income hadnt reduced in the time since the account was opened. NewDay may 
point out that the first credit limit increase only took place five months after Mrs S 
declared her income to them, but given Mrs Ss low annual income and the 
significant rise in the amount of credit being offered to her, I feel that it was 
incumbent on NewDay to have contacted Mrs S and to have confirmed their 
understanding of Mrs Ss financial position before considering implementing
any credit limit increase.
And had NewDay contacted Mrs S to question her about her ongoing financial 
position, I find it difficult to rationalise how NewDay could reasonably concluded that 
Mrs S would have been able to afford the additional credit they were considering 
offering. And I say this because Mrs S would in all likelihood have explained to 
NewDay that she remained retired meaning that her level of income was unlikely to 
increase and also that she had increasing levels of other credit which already 
amounted to more than half of her annual income.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that NewDay acted fairly or 
reasonably towards Mrs S by increasing the credit limit in her account from £900 to 
£2,150 in June 2019, and it follows that my provisional decision here will be that Ill 
be upholding this complaint against NewDay on that basis.
This aspect of my decision is the same as that reached by our investigator. However, 
I dont feel that our investigators view of this complaint took sufficient account of the 
upset and inconvenience this matter has caused Mrs S, especially given that 
NewDay provided later credit limit increases to Mrs S at a time surrounding the 
unfortunate death of her husband and when she increasingly vulnerable.
Again, its notable that NewDay didnt contact Mrs S directly before implementing 
these later credit limit increases, and also that the final amount of credit that NewDay 
provided Mrs S with was, at £8,000, more than the amount of annual income that Mrs 
S declared to NewDay at the time of the initial credit application in 2019 an which, as 
mentioned, is unlikely to have increased.
Finally, I also note that Mrs S recently received a letter from NewDay advising that 
they were intending to default her account. This has caused additional stress to Mrs 
S, which has only been compounded by NewDay refusing a request made by this 
service to refrain from such action while this investigation remains ongoing.
As such, my provisional instructions here will be as follows:
NewDay must reimburse to Mrs Ss account all interest, fees, and charges that have 
accrued or been incurred on the account on the balance of the account above £900 
since the time of the first credit limit increase in June 2019.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Mrs Ss favour, 
NewDay must pay this balance to Mrs S along with 8% interest calculated to the date 
of payment. 
If, following these reimbursements, there remains a balance outstanding for Mrs S to 
repay, NewDay must contact Mrs S and arrange a suitable interest free repayment 
plan based on an assessment of Mrs Ss income and expenditure at that time.NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting relating to this account from 
June 2019 onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £500 to Mrs S to compensate her for the 
upset and inconvenience this matter has caused. This payment may not take the 
form of credit to Mrs Ss NewDay credit account unless Mrs S gives her permission 
for it to do so.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mrs S and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they wished me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. Mrs S confirmed that she was happy to accept my provisional decision, and 
NewDay confirmed that they had no further information to provide. As such, I see no reason 
not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Mrs Ss favour on the basis described 
above.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mrs Ss account all interest, fees, and charges that have accrued 
or been incurred on the account on the balance of the account above £900 since the time of 
the first credit limit increase in June 2019.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Mrs Ss favour, NewDay 
must pay this balance to Mrs S along with 8% interest calculated to the date of payment. 
If, following these reimbursements, there remains a balance outstanding for Mrs S to repay, 
NewDay must contact Mrs S and arrange a suitable interest free repayment plan based on 
an assessment of Mrs Ss income and expenditure at that time.
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting relating to this account from June 
2019 onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £500 to Mrs S to compensate her for the upset 
and inconvenience this matter has caused. This payment may not take the form of credit to 
Mrs Ss NewDay credit account unless Mrs S gives her permission for it to do so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2022.
