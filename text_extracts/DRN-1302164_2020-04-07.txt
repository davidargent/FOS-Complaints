The complaint
Mr B complains that Stagemount Limited acted irresponsibly when it gave him unaffordable 
loans.
What happened 
This complaint is about loans Stagemount provided to Mr B between May 2014 and 
February 2018. There was a gap in lending between June 2015 and February 2018. 
Mr B took out loans that were mostly due to be paid back in one go although the last two 
loans he took out were due to be paid back by way of 6 monthly repayments. 
And except for loan 10, he repaid the loans  as far as Im aware he hasnt yet repaid the 
last loan he took out. 
Heres a table setting out details of those loans:

Mr B said that he was continuously taking out loans and borrowing more  and that 
Stagemount shouldve seen he couldnt afford these loans. 
When Mr B first complained to Stagemount it said the checks it carried out before lending 
were proportionate and decisions to lend to Mr B were responsible and made in good faith. 
But it also said that it would uphold Mr Bs complaint about loans 4 - 8 because thats when it 
shouldve made some further enquiries into his financial situation. 
And although Stagemount doesnt know what those enquiries wouldve shown, it says it 
couldve made a difference to their lending decision  so Stagemount felt redress was due  
but just for loans 4 - 8.  
Mr B didnt feel this went far enough to deal with his complaint  and when one of our 
adjudicators investigated, she agreed.
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She didnt feel shed seen enough to say that 
Stagemount shouldnt have lent loans 1 - 3 or loan 10. But she thought that Stagemount 
shouldnt have approved loans 4 - 9 and she recommended steps that Stagemount should 
take to put things right for Mr B.
Stagemount disagreed with our adjudicator about loan 9. In mainly said that after repaying 
loan 8 Mr B took a lending break of 3 months before reapplying for loan 9. And this was his 
first short-term instalment loan so Stagemount carried out more robust checks before 
agreeing this loan. Stagemount felt that after taking into account the enhanced affordability 
checks it did before agreeing loan 9 and given the significantly lower monthly repayments 
hed have to make on loan 9, it hadnt been wrong to provide this loan to Mr B.
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Stagemount needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Stagemount should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);  
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Stagemount was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication that a borrower could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
I agree with the adjudicator that it wasnt wrong for Stagemount to give Mr B the first three 
loans on the basis of the information he gave about his income and outgoings. It was early in 
the lending relationship and so I think the checks were enough for Stagemount to agree to 
lend. 
And like the adjudicator, I think the gap in lending between loans 9 and 10 was long enough 
for Stagemount to think that Mr B mightn't have needed to depend on high cost short term 
loans during this period. This meant that when his borrowing started again, and Mr B applied 
for loan 10 in February 2018, more than two years after hed paid loan 9, he was effectively 
starting over again. So I think it was fair for Stagemount to treat this as a new chain of 
borrowing and assess his lending requests accordingly. And I agree with our adjudicator that 
we havent seen enough to be able to uphold Mr Bs complaint about loan 10.
As far as I can see Mr B hasnt objected to what our adjudicator said about these loans  so 
I don't think I need say anything further about these. 
And Stagemount has already agreed to uphold Mr Bs complaint about loans 4 through to 8. 
I think thats fair. So Im mainly concentrating in my decision on the loan thats still in dispute 
 loan 9.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Stagemounts lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Stagemount should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
I think that this point was reached by loan 7  and that from loan 7 onwards lending to Mr B 
was unfair. I say this because: 
when Mr B took out loan 7, Stagemount could see that hed now been paying 
Stagemount loans for 6 months  and this was now the seventh month in a row that 
hed been indebted to Stagemount  the loan amounts had varied - but I think Stagemount shouldve realised that overall 
there were clear indications that Mr B was having money problems. Loan 7 was the 
biggest single loan Mr B had taken out  just a little under three times the amount 
hed borrowed both when he asked for his first loan and when compared with the 
loan that hed just repaid
his track record of borrowing again soon after repayment of each previous loan 
makes me think that Mr Bs finances were unstable and he was having difficulty 
managing his spending on borrowing 
I think Stagemount ought to have realised it was likely Mr B was having to borrow 
further to cover a shortfall in his finances each time he paid the previous loan  so it 
shouldve realised that this was unsustainable for him.
I think that Mr B lost out when Stagemount provided loan 7 because this loan had the effect 
of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive credit over an 
extended period of time. And the number of loans Mr B borrowed was likely to impact 
adversely on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-
cost loans. By loan 7 any further borrowing was likely to be damaging to his credit rating.
So in addition to upholding loans 4  8, Im also upholding loan 9.
Putting things right  what Stagemount needs to do
If Stagemount has sold outstanding debt on loan 10 it should buy this back before doing 
what I have outlined below. If Stagemount isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the following:
A. add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 4 - 9, not including anything already refunded
B. calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B, which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date he originally made the payments 
to the date the complaint is settled
C. if there is still an outstanding balance on loan 10, then the amounts calculated in "A" 
and "B" should be used to repay any balance remaining on this outstanding loan and 
any principal written-off under a redress scheme. If this results in a surplus then the 
surplus should be paid to Mr B. However if there is still an outstanding balance then 
Stagemount should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with him
D. Stagemount should remove any adverse information from Mr Bs credit file for 
loans 4 ,5 and 6. 
E. The overall pattern of Mr Bs borrowing by loan 7 means any information recorded 
about loans 7  9 is adverse. So all entries about loans 7, 8 and 9 should be 
removed from Mr Bs credit file. And Stagemount should ask any debt purchaser to 
do the same. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Stagemount to deduct tax from this interest. Stagemount 
should give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint about loans 4 - 9. Stagemount 
Limited should take the steps set out above to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2020.
