The complaint
Mr B acquired a used car in April 2019, by means of a 60 month hire purchase agreement 
with MotoNovo Finance Limited. He is unhappy with the customer service provided to him by 
MotoNovo. 
What happened
Mr B said:
He had repeated difficulties in using the App provided by MotoNovo for him to 
communicate with it 
He phoned MotoNovo in late July 2021, when it took 40 minutes for somebody to 
answer his call
He complained during this phone call about the poor customer service relating to his 
App
He also referred to an earlier call, in late May 2020, when MotoNovo were unable to 
assist him with his App or with another matter
He referred as well to another occasion when he phoned MotoNovo about his App
MotoNovo investigated Mr Bs complaint. It responded to him in early August 2021, saying: 
Regarding Mr Bs May 2020 phone call, it did offer him assistance which he chose 
not to take up  it also had no record of him complaining about his App during this 
call 
Mr B phoned it in mid-June 2021 about his App, and his problem was resolved
When Mr B phoned again in late July 2021, his App problem was once more resolved 
It acknowledged there were occasions when Mr B phoned that he had to wait before 
his call could be answered, but it asked him to appreciate that there were times 
when its phone lines were extremely busy
It was unable to uphold Mr Bs complaint  
Mr B then referred his complaint to us. He told us that he lost an opportunity to sell his car, 
because of the problems with his App.
Our investigator concluded that the complaint should not be upheld. He noted that evidence 
provided to us by MotoNovo supported its response to Mr Bs complaint.  And he thought 
there was not enough to warrant further action. 
Our investigator also noted that there was no evidence to support Mr Bs statement that he 
missed a selling opportunity.  And he noted as well that MotoNovo would have had to give its 
permission, before such a sale could have taken place. 
Mr B disagreed with our investigator, but he provided to us no additional information or 
evidence. And so, this complaint was referred for review by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where evidence is incomplete, inconsistent or contradictory (as some of it is here), I reach 
my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider most likely to 
have happened in light of the available evidence and wider circumstances. 
On the one hand, Mr B argues:
MotoNovo provided consistently bad customer service to him
He missed out on an opportunity to sell his car 
On the other hand:
MotoNovo argues that it provided the customer service sought by Mr B, although it 
acknowledges that he did have to wait sometimes for his phone calls to it to be 
answered
Evidence supplied to us by MotoNovo supports MotoNovos argument
I have seen no evidence relating to a car selling opportunity
Also, Mr B is in the third year of a hire purchase agreement  which means that he 
does not yet own this vehicle, and so any sale of his car could only occur with 
MotoNovos permission 
My conclusion must take full account of the presence and absence of supporting evidence. 
This means I am unable, on balance, to find that MotoNovo provided poor customer service 
which would warrant further action to be taken.
So, I have come to the same conclusion as our investigator, for similar reasons.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
