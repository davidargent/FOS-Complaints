K820x#14complaint
Mr L says Barclays Bank  UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) mis-sold him a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mr L bought the policy  in 2000 at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr L disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ls case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ls complaint because:
 I think Barclaycard made  Mr L aware that the PPI was optional  and that he chose to 
take it. I say this because he did tick the box on the credit  card application form to say 
that he wanted the cover.
 Barclaycard didnt recommend the PPI to Mr L so it didnt have to check if it was 
suitable for him. That means it didnt have  to ask about  any sick pay or savings he 
might have  been able to use to cover his repayments. 
 Its possible the information Barclaycard gave Mr L about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
should have been.  But its unlikely Mr L would have been  affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it.

My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.

reject my decision  before 13 April 2019.
