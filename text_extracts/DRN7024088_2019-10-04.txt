When Mr J complained to Sunny it upheld his complaint in part and offered redress  on loans 1 
and 4. Unhappy  with the offer, Mr J brought his complaint to this service. Our adjudicator 
thought that more loans  shouldnt have been given to Mr J and recommended that loan 6 
onwards should  be upheld.  Sunny didnt fully accept the adjudicators view and offered to 
redress loan 8 onwards.  Mr J didnt accept the offer and so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable 
in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve  set out our general approach  to complaints 
about short-term  lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry 
practice - on our website.  
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks could take into account  a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  
and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN70240882But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr J could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue difficulties 
and in particular  the customer should  be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that loans 2, 3 and 5 should  be upheld,  I cant  see that 
Mr J disagreed with this as such, I dont think these loans are still in dispute. And so along  with 
the loans Sunny has made offers on, loans 1 to 5 and 8 to 18 are no longer in dispute.
So my decision focuses  on loans  6 and 7 but Ive considered the other  loans as part of 
Mr Js borrowing history with Sunny.
Before Sunny agreed to lend loans 6 and 7, it says it asked Mr J about his monthly income 
and living  costs including credit commitments. Mr J declared £1,650 as his income for loan 6 
and £1,850 for loan 7. Mr Js monthly  expenses  for both loans were £1,000. Given  that the 
maximum repayment for both loans  was £85.57 and £49.33, on the face of it, it looked like Mr 
J could afford the loans.
But Im concerned that by the time of loan 6 and 7, Mr J had established an obvious pattern of 
dependency on these  types of loans  that Sunny ought to have realised he wasnt  repaying 
sustainably.
Ref: DRN70240883I say this because:
Mr J had been indebted to Sunny for more than 16 months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr J was having  to borrow  further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr J was provided  with a new loan within  a short time of settling  
a previous one. I can see that loan 7 was lent on the same  day Mr J repaid loan 6.
In the circumstances, Mr J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed 
Sunny. Loan 18 was taken out 41 months after Mr Js first. And it was for a similar  
amount. Mr J had paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans  and  the  length of time over which  Mr J borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 and 7. Sunny should  put things right on 
loans 1, 4 and loans 6 to 18.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 1, 4 and 6 to 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 and 4 from Mr Js credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 18 should be removed from 
Mr Js credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr J compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
