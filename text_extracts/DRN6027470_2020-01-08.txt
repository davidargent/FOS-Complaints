K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs A complain  that there was a shortfall in the amount paid to them by 
Barclays Bank UK PLC following their successful application for a re-mortgage.  To resolve 
their complaint they want Barclays to:
1.pay to them the sum of £851, or whatever was the shortfall, as compensation for its error 
because this is the amount they would  have been deprived of if theyd failed to notice the 
error committed by Barclays and its solicitors; 
2.pay to them any other compensation  that the ombudsman may deem  appropriate for the 
inconvenience and confusion; 
3.send to them a revised completion statement since the statement sent on 
17 August 2018 was found to be incorrect.
background 
In their complaint  form Mr and Mrs A say that on 29 May 2018  they applied  to Barclays for a 
further advance  on their buy-to-let mortgage. In fact this appears to have been treated as a 
re-mortgage.  
In the application form they declined the option of free legal services. It follows  from this, in 
the absence of any evidence to the contrary,  that the solicitors appointed by Barclays were 
acting for Barclays alone. On a re-mortgage, especially one with the existing lender, there is 
no conveyancing to do, so all of the legal work is delegated parts  of the regulated activity, 
which is the responsibility of the lender.
The application was approved and on 17 August  2018 Barclays  solicitors wrote:
We write to confirm that we have  completed your remortgage today  and enclose  a 
completion statement  for your records.
The completion statement  showed a net sum of £40,472.14 due to Mr and Mrs A, which  the 
solicitors sent to their bank account on 17 August. However Mr and Mrs A thought this 
amount was wrong and they emailed  Barclays on 18 August saying the amount was in their 
opinion incorrect. They said:
We should  have received a sum of £42,315.42 into our  Bank account and not the 
£40,472.14 sent into our account.  There is a shortfall of £1,843.28 we are still due. Kindly 
review our complaint and send us this outstanding balance.
Barclays replied on 20 August:
As the funds have been sent to your bank account  for account xxx and xxx by your 
solicitors/ conveyancer, you would need  to discuss the figure that have issued  [sic] to 
yourself.
As at today  on account xxx we have not received  the funds from your solicitors/conveyancer 
to redeem this account,  so we are unable to see what  funds they have/are  going to be 
issuing to us to redeem this account.
Ref: DRN60274702Mr and Mrs A say this failed to address their complaint. They  emailed Barclays  on 
20 August:
We refer to your response to our complaint. We today received a completion statement from 
xxx, solicitors  to Barclays. Here is the summary  of this statement:
Completion Date - 17/8/18
Advance Monies - £137,554
Balance to be deducted  - £35
Total Monies Received - £137,519.99
Mortgage Redemption
First Charge Barclays Bank plc - £96,924.85
Total Amount to Repay  Existing Charge - £96,924.85
I do not know how Barclays or [solicitors] arrived at the above amount of £96,924.85  when 
the outstanding balance  on our old mortgage accountas at 9/8/18 was £95,963.88  as per 
the redemption  statement  sent to us by Barclays itself.

Please arrange  for the shortfall to be paid as soon as possible.  We are also demanding 
compensation for the unnecessary underpayment,  inconvenience and confusion.
Mr and Mrs A say the amount paid to them  by Barclays failed to take into consideration the 
monthly repayments made from the time of their application (29 May 2018) to completion of 
the remortgage (17 August 2018). The two monthly repayments they made effectively 
reduced the existing  balance  from the £97,554.99 mentioned above.
Mr and Mrs A say they were short changed by Barclays and its solicitors. What  should have 
been paid was the new loan of £137,554.99 less the balance on the existing facility  as at the 
completion date of 17 August 2018,  which Barclays itself later gave as £96,924.85  
(£137,554.99 - £96,924.85 = £41,323.42). So they should have received £41,323.42  and not 
the £40,472.14 paid.  They were short changed  by £851.28.
Barclays sent two replies to Mr and Mrs A dated  21 August and 14 September  2018.
On 21 August it said:
If you have  any queries  with the amount of funds  that [solicitors] have sent us you will need 
to refer to them directly.They will attempt  to contact you within the 1st 5 working days to 
resolve the complaint.
On 14 September  it said:
I can confirm we received redemption funds of £96,924.85 for the above  account on 
20/08/2018, a refund of £851.28 was sent to your nominated  bank account  on 23/08/2018.
Mr and Mrs A say that this made no reference  to their complaint and contained no 
acknowledgement of any error on Barclays part, nor any apology. 
Ref: DRN60274703On 16 September  they asked Barclays why they werent notified  about the 23 August refund 
until 14 September, considering that they raised  their complaint on 20 August. Barclays 
replied on 25 September:
You believe  that there has been a shortfall of £1,843.28 when re-mortgaging your Buy to 
Let (BTL) mortgage and you would like this to be looked into.
I am sorry  for the experience you have had regarding your re-mortgage. I have received the 
calculations back from our Mortgage  Team and they have  found  that no error has been 
made on this occasion. Below is the calculation:
The Balance on 03 August 2018 was £95,963.88. Interest of £109.69 was added  on the 
20 August 2018.  Your Early Repayment Charge (ERC) of £2,958.92 was added which 
totaled [sic] £99,032.49. 
Your ERC was waived which brought the total down to £96,073.57.
The redemption funds  received were £96,924.85 therefore we refunded a credit  on account 
£851.28 back to yourself.
Mr and Mrs A werent happy  with this and brought their complaint to this service. They  said:
The shortfall we indicated was £851  . The short payment arose  as a result of the grossly 
incorrect completion statement prepared  by the Bank. While Barclays eventually paid this 
shortfall of £851  surprisingly without a notification, we are concerned  that Barclays did not 
even bother to acknowledge  their error  or send us an apology.
Our position is that we would have been  out of pocket  by at least  £851, if we had not taken 
the time to scrutinise the completion statement sent to us by the bank.  In redress we are 
asking for the same  amount  in compensation i.e. the amount that would have been  our loss 
if the negligence exercised by Barclays had gone unnoticed.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint be upheld.  He said:
The balance on your existing mortgage was £95,963.88. Interest of £109.69 was added  on 
20 August 2018.  An Early  Repayment Charge (ERC) of £2,958.92 was added,  which 
increased the balance £99,032.49. The ERC was waived though, so your balance  went 
down to £96,073.57. The redemption funds that were received were £96,924.85,  so Barclays  
refunded you £851.28,  which you have confirmed  you received on 23 August 2018.
You think that Barclays should  have paid you £42,315.42 and not the £40,472.14 that you 
received. This is based on a redemption statement you say you received from Barclays  in 
August 2018,  which showed a balance on your mortgage of £95,239.57. I have looked at the 
redemption statement Barclays sent you dated  8 August 2018, and can't see where  you 
have got the figure of £95,239.57 from. The redemption statement shows that the capital 
balance of your mortgage  for redemption on 9 August 2018 was £95,963.88.
I don't think the completion statement Barclays have provided (a copy  of which was sent to 
you) is incorrect.  It confirms that you were borrowing £137,554.99. £96,924.85 went  to 
redeem your existing  mortgage  (with £851.28  refunded as above.) This left £40,630.14  owed 
to you. As per the mortgage statement there  was then a balance of £35.00  to be deducted, 
Ref: DRN60274704as well as £96.00 in fees and £27.00 in disbursements. This meant that the balance  due to 
you was £40,472.14, which is what you received.
So I cannot agree  that there  is any shortfall  owed to you as Barclays have already refunded 
you the £851.28 owed to you. I don't think Barclays have acted unfairly or unreasonably so 
don't think  Barclays should  have to pay you any compensation.
Mr and Mrs A didnt  agree. They said their complaint  wasnt  that they thought  there had been 
a shortfall of £851  in payment. They had never  requested any shortfall repayment. 
What they had said was that as a result  of professional negligence on the part of Barclays,  
payments due to them  on their re-mortgage facility came short  by £851. They  were  fortunate 
to discover this shortfall, after scrutinising the completion statement Barclays sent to them. 
They said they took this up with Barclays and a payment of £851 was quietly made,  but 
without any apology or acknowledgement of fault.  Their complaint was a request for 
compensation of what could  have been their loss if Barclays error had gone unnoticed.
They said Barclays had incorrectly paid them £40,472 on 17 August 2018  instead of 
£41,323. The amount was immediately  contested,  and Barclays then paid the shortfall of 
£851 on 23 August  2018 without apologising for its negligence. They  could have been out of 
pocket by £851 if they hadnt taken the time to scrutinise Barclays  completion statement on 
the re-mortgage. Barclays hadnt even  bothered  to send  them  an amended  and correct copy 
of the completion  statement.
Mr and Mrs A asked  how could £96,924.85 have gone to pay the capital outstanding on 
17 August 2018  when  all they owed on 9 August 2018 was £95,963.88?
Mr and Mrs A asked  for an ombudsman to look into the matter.
I took a different view of the complaint to the adjudicator. So I decided to issue  a provisional  
decision, setting  out my view of the case and inviting further comments. Mr and Mrs A have 
responded so I issue my final decision.
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I said:
I dont agree that Mr and Mrs A had never  requested any shortfall  repayment. In their email  
to Barclays of 18 August  2018 they said:
There is shortfall of £1,843.28 we are still due. Kindly review our complaint and send us this 
outstanding balance.
In that email Mr and Mrs A referred  to a shortfall of £1,843.28. In their complaint to this 
service they say they were short changed by £851.28.
In its letter  of 25 September 2018  Barclays was obviously  responding to the £1,843.28 
complaint. That was the amount of the shortfall  which Mr and Mrs A had complained about in 
their email  of 18 August.
Ref: DRN60274705But by 25 September it was already  clear  from Mr and Mrs As email of 16 September that 
they were no longer  complaining about  a shortfall  of £1,843.28, but about Barclays failure  to 
notify them about the 23 August refund of £851.28 until 14 September.  Barclays didnt 
respond to that complaint.
I can see from the statement on the buy-to-let account dated 31 December 2018 that 
Barclays recorded a redemption credit (presumably from its solicitors) of £96,924.85  on 
17 August 2018.  That figure was wrong because on 23 August 2018 there is a debit entry:  
refund overpayment of £851.28. 
Barclays or its solicitors initially underpaid Mr and Mrs A by £851.28. Mr and Mrs A therefore  
suspect that if they hadnt complained, the error wouldnt have been rectified at all. In their 
response to the adjudicators view, they said:
for all we know we could have  been  out of pocket by £851 if we had not taken the time to 
scrutinise the bank's completion statement on our re-mortgage.
But I dont think that suspicion  is justified, because Mr and Mrs As complaint regarding  the 
£851.28 was made  on 16 September 2018,  by which  time Barclays had already paid it.
Nevertheless I think the reasons for this complaint are that although Barclays  rectified  the 
error, it didnt acknowledge the error, didnt tell Mr and Mrs A until 14 September  that it had 
rectified the error on 23 August,  didnt make any apology for it, and didnt respond to 
Mr and Mrs As complaint of 16 September.  And its earlier suggestion that if they had any 
queries they should refer them to Barclays solicitors instead  was in my view unhelpful. Why 
should they have to do that?
In my view these matters caused trouble and upset  to Mr and Mrs A. They say:
In redress we are asking  for the same amount in compensation i.e. the amount that would 
have been our loss if the negligence exercised by Barclays  had gone  unnoticed.
As stated above I dont  agree that Mr and Mrs A would have suffered that loss if they hadnt 
scrutinised the completion statement, and of course they didnt suffer  it. It wouldnt be fair to 
expect Barclays to pay twice. For the trouble and upset caused to Mr and Mrs A, I consider 
Barclays should pay them compensation of £150.
Mr and Mrs A also seek a revised completion  statement to include the missing £851.28. 
However I dont consider  it appropriate  to direct  Barclays to provide this because  a 
completion statement  should reflect what actually happened. 
the responses to my provisional  decision
Mr and Mrs A responded to my provisional  decision. Barclays didnt respond.
Mr and Mrs A said there were gaps in some of the arguments underlying  my provisional 
decision. They said:
1.The remortgage facility in question was approved on 17 August 2018, with money 
disbursed by Barclays  to our account on this date.
Ref: DRN602747062.On 18 August 2018 my wife and I raised a complaint  to Barclays  reporting  an 
underpayment to us in respect of the facility. We went on to advise a shortfall of 
£1,843.42.
3.While  our complaint about an underpayment  was adjudged correct, the figure of 
£1,843.42 provided  as the shortfall was however found to be incorrect.
4.The actual shortfall was later found out to be £851.28 and not £1,843.42.
5.The £851.28 was paid by Barclays into our account on 23 August 2018 - the bank did not 
even bother to acknowledge  that we were  ever underpaid.
6.So the basis of our complaint was factual, right and indeed very correct - there was 
clearly an underpayment except that the amount we put down  as the shortfall  was 
incorrect.
7.In response to our statement - "...for  all we know we could have  been  out of pocket by 
£851 if we had not taken the time to scrutinise the bank's completion statement on our 
re-mortgage"
the ombudsman  stated:
"But I do not think that suspicion is justified, because Mr and Mrs A's complaint regarding 
the £851.28 was made  on 16 September 2018,  by which time Barclays  had already paid 
it"
I am sorry  to say that the above statement by the ombudsman is not true. Our complaint 
concerning an underpayment,  which was the crux of the dispute with Barclays  was 
reported to Barclays  on 18 August 2018  (and not 16 September 2018 as suggested  here 
by the ombudsman),  even  though  the quantum of the shortfall put forward by us was 
above the actual figure.
8.From  the ombudsman:
"... I don't agree that Mr and Mrs A would have suffered that loss if they hadn't 
scrutinised the completion statement, and of course they did not suffer it. It would  not be 
fair to expect  Barclays to pay twice"
Going by the ombudsman comment here, if a cashier in the bank through negligence 
under reports the cash in his possession at the close of business day and returns 
whatever he did not account for 3 days later, does this mean that there has not been  an 
infringement or a violation? Should  we simply look the other way then?
While the ombudsman could not envisage any loss to us, he failed to state  what  could or 
would have happened if my wife and I had not taken  the time to scrutinise the incorrect 
completion statement  sent to us by Barclays.
It was only when we complained of an underpayment on 18 August 2018, that Barclays  
quietly paid a shortfall  of £851.28 into our account on 23 August 2018. The Bank failed to 
admit or own up to its negligence in a deliberate attempt to cover  up its misdeeds. Quite 
a number of unwary  Barclays' customers could have been  cut [sic] in this sort of situation  
too.
Ref: DRN602747079.We reiterate that the completion statement provided by Barclays is grossly incorrect 
because the key figures stated therein are wrong - we did provide evidence to this effect. 
It is our opinion  that when  a completion statement does not reflect  or summarise  a 
transaction correctly,  there should have  been an order for this to be reworked in order to 
provide a true and fair view of what actually transpired.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs A have  helpfully  numbered their responses to my provisional  decision. Following 
that numbering:
1.I wasnt aware that there was any dispute about that, and I cant see where  there is any 
gap in my provisional decision  here. Mr and Mrs A dont  identify any gaps.
2.I dont agree. As stated in my provisional  decision, in their email  to Barclays of 
18 August 2018 Mr and Mrs A said:
There is shortfall of £18,843.28 we are still due. Kindly review  our complaint and send 
us this outstanding balance.
Having said that, its not obvious to me that the difference of £0.14 between  the two 
figures has any particular  implications for this decision.
3.Save that the figure  provided as the shortfall was £18,843.28 not £18,843.42,  I agree.
4.I agree  that the actual initial underpayment was £851.28.
5.I dont agree that there is a gap in my provisional decision here. In my provisional 
decision I said:
On 14 September it said:
I can confirm we received  redemption funds  of £96,924.85  for the above  account on 
20/08/2018, a refund of £851.28 was sent to your nominated  bank account  on 
23/08/2018.
and 
Mr and Mrs A say that this made no reference  to their complaint and contained no 
acknowledgement of any error on Barclays part, nor any apology.
6.(wrongly numbered as 5) I cant see that there  is a gap in my provisional  decision here.
7.(wrongly numbered as 6) I dont agree that the statement wasnt true. The complaint 
about the £851.28 was made  on 16 September 2018. The complaint made on 
18 August 2018 was about the £1,843.28.  That wasnt the amount which Barclays paid 
on 23 August 2018.
Ref: DRN602747088.(wrongly numbered as 7) The point being made  was only that Mr and Mrs A didnt suffer  
a loss of £851.28. Im not persuaded on the evidence that it has been  shown  that 
Barclays would have  deliberately withheld the  £851.28 on 23 August if Mr and Mrs A 
hadnt complained about the £1,843.28 on 18 August.
9.(wrongly numbered as 8) Barclays having  paid the £851.28, no purpose would be served 
by ordering it to provide a revised completion statement.
For the reasons  given  Im not persuaded to alter my provisional conclusions and I confirm  
them here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and order Barclays  Bank UK PLC to pay 
Mr and Mrs A £150 compensation for the trouble and upset caused  to them.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs A to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 February  2020.
