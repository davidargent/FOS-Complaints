complaint
Miss P complains  that AvantCredit of UK, LLC lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss P was given a loan of £7,000 by AvantCredit in January 2016. The loan was due to be 
repaid in 36 monthly instalments of about  £313.The total amount to be repaid including  
interest was just over £11, 293.
Miss P says that AvantCredit  should  have carried out better  checks before agreeing to lend 
to her, and had it done so, it would  have realised that she couldnt afford the loan.
One of our adjudicators has looked into Miss Ps complaint.  She thought AvantCredit had 
been wrong to provide Miss P with the loan and asked it to put things right. AvantCredit didn't 
agree with the adjudicators assessment, and so the complaint has been  passed to me to 
make a final decision about the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good  industry  practice  - on our website.
AvantCredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. This 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that Miss P could 
repay the loan in a sustainable way. AvantCredit's checks could take into account  a number 
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. But there was no set list of checks that AvantCredit 
had to do.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But I've also considered if there were any other  factors  that 
might indicate that AvantCredit should fairly and reasonably have  done  more to establish  
whether the lending was sustainable  for Miss P.
Such factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
K821x#15
Ref: DRN8112078the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered  all the evidence, arguments  and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Miss P.
AvantCredit carried out some checks before lending to Miss P. This included  asking for 
details of her income and expenditure and carrying out some  credit checks. AvantCredit 
says it thinks the checks  it carried out before agreeing to lend to Miss P were proportionate 
and that the loan was affordable. And in some  cases these checks may have been a 
reasonable course of action to take.
But AvantCredit was required to establish whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loan  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't  automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
I dont think AvantCredits  checks went far enough  on this occasion and I dont think  the 
lender did enough to check  that the lending was sustainable before lending  to Miss P.
I say this because  Miss Ps credit report shows that her total indebtedness  was already over
£19,000 and she had also opened  seven accounts  with other creditors in the previous six 
months, with a pattern of borrowing and rapidly  repaying quite large  sums.  I accept  that 
there were no recent delinquent or defaulted  accounts showing, but I think  the information 
gathered should  reasonably have caused  some concerns for AvantCredit because  it 
indicated that Miss P might be having  difficulties managing her money. Having seen the 
information in the credit report, I think AvantCredit should have then carried  out more in 
depth checks to reasonably  satisfy itself that Miss P could repay the loan sustainably.
AvantCredit has told us that the purpose  of Miss Ps loan was to consolidate existing debts 
which would have reduced her credit  commitments  by 35%. And so it didnt think more in- 
depth checks were required.  AvantCredit  says had the lending been for another purpose it 
would have meant that its loan would have been an additional monthly expense, and it would 
then have felt it necessary  to request a bank statement from Miss P.
Ive thought about this carefully.  But Miss P was applying  to AvantCredit for an expensive 
loan, repayable over a long period. Whilst she might have said she intended to use the loan 
to consolidate  some of her existing debt, she was taking an expensive  loan to do so. And it 
seems to me that AvantCredit ought reasonably to have realised that if Miss P was not able 
to repay  as much of her debt as she intended, there was a substantial  risk that her loan 
would increase the level of her debt unsustainably. I appreciate that AvantCredit  had
Ref: DRN8112078acquired a credit report and had asked Miss P about  her income  and expenditure. But I think  
that it relied heavily  on information she provided about her circumstances and her apparent  
intentions for the loan.  The rules  and regulations say that where  a lender takes income  or 
expenditure into account, it is not generally  sufficient for it to rely solely on a statement of 
those matters made by the customer. In the circumstances I would expect AvantCredit to 
have wanted to gather and independently check more detailed information  about Miss Ps 
financial situation in order to assess whether shed be able to sustainably repay her loan 
over the extended  loan term.
So as well as asking  Miss P about  her income  and expenditure, I think  AvantCredit should  
have carried out more detailed and independent  checks into Miss Ps financial 
circumstances  for example by asking to see her bank statements.
Miss P has provided us with copies of her bank statements leading up to her application  to 
AvantCredit, so I can determine  what better checks might have shown AvantCredit at that 
time. And I have considered this information in light of what  Ive set out above. Of course, 
different checks might  show different things. But I think if AvantCredit  had carried  out what I 
consider to be proportionate checks, I think its likely it would  have discovered  more about 
Miss Ps financial position.  In particular I think it more likely  than not AvantCredit would have 
realised that Miss P had been  borrowing  from a number of other short-term lenders  and that 
she was regularly gambling.
AvantCredit says that Miss P did not disclose her gambling issues  and it accepted what 
shed told it about  her income  and expenditure in good faith. But as Ive already explained, 
AvantCredit was required to establish  whether Miss P could sustainably  make her loan 
repayments.
Overall, given the size and cost of this loan and the information that AvantCredit had already 
gathered from Miss Ps credit report,  I think AvantCredit ought  reasonably  to have carried  out 
more in depth checks to satisfy  itself that Miss P could repay the loan sustainably. And if 
AvantCredit had carried out more detailed,  independent checks on Miss Ps finances, I think 
it ought reasonably  to have realised that she was having serious difficulties  managing her 
finances and that she was potentially  borrowing as a result of her gambling  and would also 
most likely need to borrow elsewhere  to repay  her loan from AvantCredit. I would have 
expected AvantCredit to realise that it was unlikely that Miss P would be able to sustainably  
repay her loan. So it ought  reasonably  to have concluded that it was not appropriate to lend 
to her.
So I dont  think AvantCredit was right to provide the loan to Miss P.
Putting things  right
I think it is fair and reasonable for Miss P to repay  the principal  amount that she borrowed, 
because shes had the benefit of that lending. But shes paid interest and charges on a loan 
that shouldnt  have been provided to her. So I think Miss P has lost out and AvantCredit 
should put things right for her.
I can see that AvantCredit agreed a repayment plan with Miss P. If the loan is still 
outstanding AvantCredit should  try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement with Miss 
P in respect of any outstanding  balance  - bearing  in mind the need to treat her positively and 
sympathetically in those discussions. If AvantCredit has sold the outstanding debt it should 
buy it back, if its able to do so, and then take the following steps.  If AvantCredit  isnt able to
Ref: DRN8112078buy the debt back  then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below.
AvantCredit should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  on the loan and treat all the payments 
Miss P made as payments towards the capital.
If reworking Miss Ps loan account results in her having effectively made 
payments above the original capital borrowed, then AvantCredit should  refund 
these overpayments  with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  
from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date ofsettlement*.
If reworking the account leaves an amount of capital  still to be paid, then 
AvantCredit should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss P.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ps credit  file in relation  to the 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. 
AvantCredit must give Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ps complaint and direct  AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put 
things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 December  2020.
