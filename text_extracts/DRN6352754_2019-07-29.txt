K822xcomplaint
Mr S has complained about short term loans granted to him by PDL Finance Limited (PDL 
or the lender). PDL agreed 18 loans for Mr S from November 2013  to July 2016.  
background 
The background to the complaint was set out in my provisional decision of 21 June  2019,  a 
copy of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partially  uphold  this complaint. 
I gave both parties a month to comment on my provisional findings. Mr S says he accepts 
these and I have  received  no response  from PDL. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As PDL hasnt provided any further 
evidence or arguments  for consideration, I see no reason to depart  from the conclusions  set 
out in my provisional  decision. It follows that I partially uphold  Mr Ss complaint.
what PDL needs to do to put things right
For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision,  Ive concluded that PDL was 
irresponsible to have  agreed to loans  2 and 3, and to loan 7 onwards for Mr S. 
In order to put him back in the position he would have been  in, had it not agreed to these, 
PDL should:  
-refund all interest  and charges Mr S paid for loans 2 and 3 and for loan 7 onwards;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove any adverse information about loans 2 and 3 from Mr Ss credit  file;
-remove all information about loans 7 onwards from Mr Ss credit file; 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  PDL to take off tax from this interest. PDL must give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ss complaint  about PDL Finance Limited in part and require it to put things right 
for him as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 August 2019.

complaint
Mr S has complained about short term loans granted to him by PDL Finance Limited (PDL  or the 
lender). 
background
PDL agreed  18 loans  for Mr S from November  2013 to July 2016 for amounts between £100 and 
£450. Most of the loans  were to be repaid in a single payment, a few over two or three payments, and 
all were repaid on time or early.
Mr S says that PDL lent irresponsibly because the loans  were  unaffordable for him and it should have 
known this from his credit  file record. He also says that the number  of loans  he took out should have 
flagged to PDL that he was in financial difficulty. Some of the information PDL provided about  these 
loans are shown in a table in an appendix to this document.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ss complaint in part and recommended that PDL refund the interest and 
charges he paid from loan 7 onwards. PDL disagreed  with this recommendation and the complaint 
has come  to me, as an ombudsman,  for review and final decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I have also taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) was the regulator at the time when Mr S borrowed his first five loans. 
The Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA)  took over the regulation of short  term lenders from 01 April 
2014, in other words  for Mr Ss sixth loan onward. The relevant rules  and guidance said that for all 
loans PDL needed to check that Mr S could  afford to meet his repayments in a sustainable  manner. 
This meant  Mr S being able to meet his repayments out of his normal  income without  having to go 
without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about  what checks PDL needed to carry out in order to 
reasonable assess  whether or not Mr S would be able to meet his repayments sustainably. But the 
regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. So, the same checks might  not be 
proportionate for all consumers, or for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id expect  a 
lender to seek more  assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income; or
-the longer the lending  relationship.
So, as our adjudicator did, Ive first thought about whether or not the checks  PDL carried out were  
proportionate and, if not, what  proportionate checks might  have shown. Ive also thought  about 
whether or not the number of high cost short term loans PDL provided to Mr S was in itself an issue 
for him. The purpose of such  credit is to provide a solution  to a short term cash  flow problem and 
using this type of credit to meet an ongoing shortfall in income is likely  to become unsustainable. 
The FCAs  rules and guidance is set out in its Consumer  Credit Handbook (CONC).  Ive set out below  
some of the guidance pertaining  to repeat  lending. 
Ref: DRN63527543CONC 6.7.21G says:
A firm should not refinance high-cost short-term  credit  where to do so is unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 of ILG]
And CONC 6.7.22G says:
A firm should not allow a customer to enter  into consecutive agreements with the firm for 
high-cost short-term credit if the cumulative  effect  of the agreements would be that the total 
amount payable  by the customer is unsustainable.
[Note: paragraph 6.25 (box)  of ILG]
The Office of Fair Trading set out its guidance for lenders in its Irresponsible Lending  Guidance 
document or ILG. Paragraph 6.25 of ILG states  that it would be a deceptive and/or unfair practice 
where a lender is:
Repeatedly refinancing (or rolling over) a borrowers  existing credit commitment for a 
short-term credit product  in a way that is unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Section 6.25 then goes  on to say:
The OFT considers that this would include  a creditor allowing a borrower  to sequentially enter 
into a number  of separate agreements for short-term loan products, one after another, where  
the overall effect is to increase the borrowers  indebtedness in an unsustainable  manner.
The general  purpose of short-term loans, such as payday loans, is to provide borrowers with 
a cash advance  until their next pay day and they are usually about 30 days, or just over, in 
duration. However, in certain circumstances, the borrower  can elect to renew  the loan for a 
fee and delay  payment for a further agreed period of time.
The purpose  of payday loans is to act as a short-term solution to temporary cash flow 
problems experienced by consumers. They are not appropriate for supporting sustained 
borrowing over longer periods, for which other products are likely  to be more suitable.
I understand that PDL gathered information about Mr Ss monthly income and expenditure each time 
he asked for a loan. It says his income ranged between £1,600 and £1,800 and his expenses 
remained the same throughout at £1,050 - I note £420 of which  was to repay existing debt. PDL also 
carried out credit file checks and provided some summary results from these which show that Mr S 
didnt have any active formal  debt management  plans or bankruptcies. 
Our adjudicator explained that when  Mr S asked for a second larger  loan, it would have been 
reasonable for PDL to have understood  not only what  Mr S needed  to spend on a regular  basis but to 
also check if there was anything else which might impact on his ability  to repay this loan  other 
outstanding payday loans for example.  And when he asked for his third, again for a larger amount, it 
wasnt fair for PDL to continue to rely on the information he provided without taking steps to verify it. 
Mr S went on to borrow various amounts and continued to reapply for credit within a few weeks of 
repaying his previous loan. And, given the frequency of his borrowing, PDL ought  to have continued 
to gather more  information  about Mr Ss finances and verify this throughout their lending  relationship.  
I agree with these findings.  Furthermore,  even without a detailed consideration of what  PDL might  
have found out about Mr Ss finances  had it inquired  further into them,  I dont think  PDL should have 
agreed loans 2 or 3 for him. The repayments for these loans  were £455 and £585 respectively.  
Assuming Mr Ss recorded  income was at the lower end of the given range for his first few loans 
(which his bank statements  support), the repayments  for these loans took up most if not all of his 
stated disposable income and, foreseeably, were unlikely to be repayable in a sustainable manner. 
So I dont think it was fair of PDL to have agreed to these,  and it needs to put this right.
Ref: DRN63527544When Mr S asked for his seventh loan it came at the end of a run of increasing loan amounts, with 
little time between him repaying one loan and asking  for another. So I think  when Mr S applied for this 
loan, over six months after hed first applied for credit,  PDL ought  to have taken a step back and 
asked whether or not it was responsible to continue to agree credit for Mr S as the pattern of lending 
up to that point showed  that he wasnt borrowing to meet  a short-term  cash-flow problem but was 
likely to have been borrowing to meet  an ongoing need. 
As Ive set out above, the regulations were clear that short term loans were for short-term  purposes 
and that consecutive  lending was an example of an unfair practice likely  to be irresponsible. Indeed 
PDLs own website  states that high  cost short term credit loans are not a suitable solution for people 
in financial difficulty and for longer term borrowing. And PDL seems to have acknowledged this in an 
offer to Mr S where it offered  to refund  the interest Mr S paid for loans 17 and 18 and also loans 13, 
14, 15 as these were the most sequential loans. 
Altogether, I think PDL ought  to have taken note of the pattern of lending up to this point and not 
agreed Mr Ss seventh  loan or any further credit for him. It should have considered that meeting his 
financial need  through high cost credit wasnt likely  to be sustainable for Mr S and was potentially 
harmful, given the high interest he needed to pay and the record that repeat borrowing  would leave  on 
his credit file. And so Im concluding that it was irresponsible to lend to him beyond  this point.
I have noted that there were  some gaps between Mr Ss later loans, for example there was a gap of 
about three months between him repaying loan 15 (in February 2015)  and asking  for loan 16 and 
between repaying this and asking for loan 17. Mr S had been borrowing  from PDL for about 15 
months by the end of February 2015. As Ive explained, this is beyond  what PDL could reasonably 
think was a period of borrowing for emergency purposes. And, given this history, I dont  think a few 
months gap could then be seen as an indication  that Mr Ss situation had improved and that he was 
no longer relying on its loans to meet an ongoing need.  
A longer  gap of about  nine months came before  Mr S borrowed his last loan. I have thought carefully 
about this  it is a considerable period of time. However,  when Mr S repaid  his previous loan (in 
October 2015) hed been a customer of PDLs for almost  two years. And when he came  back to 
borrow again,  this time asking for double the amount, I understand PDL didnt do anything differently 
to assess  the risk to him of his repayments being  unsustainably affordable  than what  it had done 
when he first borrowed from it. I havent seen anything from either  party  which suggests Mr Ss 
situation had improved in the intervening time. So I dont think PDL ought to have  agreed his last loan. 
what PDL needs to do to put things right
Ive provisionally concluded that PDL was irresponsible to have agreed loans  2 and 3, or loan 7 
onwards for Mr S. In order to put him back in the position he would have been in, had it not agreed to 
these, PDL should: 
-refund all interest  and charges Mr S paid for loans 2 and 3 and for loan 7 onwards;
-pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the dates of 
settlement;
-remove  any adverse information about loans  2 and 3 from Mr Ss credit file;
-remove  all information about  loans  7 onwards from Mr Ss credit  file; 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires PDL to take off tax from this interest. PDL must  give Mr S a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN63527545my provisional  decision
I intend  to uphold  Mr Ss complaint for the reasons given above and require PDL Finance Limited to 
put things right as Ive set out. 
Ill wait a month to see if either party has anything  further  to add before considering my decision on 
this complaint once more.
