The complaint
Miss R complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) is refusing to refund her the amount she 
lost as the result of a scam.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary Miss R was contacted by a third party called Future Currency Trading (FC) that 
offered Miss R the opportunity to make an investment with it. Miss R was convinced the 
opportunity was genuine and agreed to send funds to FC to invest. As part of the scam Miss 
R was asked to download screen sharing software to her device that gave FC remote 
access to her device.
Miss R was also asked to open an account with Revolut so she could send funds to the 
scam via this bank that was described by FC as crypto friendly.
The payments Miss R made werent made to FC directly, she sent several payments to 
Coinbase (a cryptocurrency exchange), one payment to a third party at Monzo, and the rest 
to another account in her name at Revolut, before the funds were forwarded to the scammer. 
I can only consider the payments Miss R made from her Lloyds account under this 
complaint.
Below are a list of the transfers Miss R made from her Lloyds account:
Date Payee Amount
15 February 2022 Coinbase £2,000
16 February 2022 Coinbase £900
16 February 2022 Coinbase £8,300

10 March 2022 Revolut (Miss R) £3,100
Miss R attempted to withdraw the funds from the investment but was unable to recover any 
of the payments she had made. It was apparent she had fallen victim to a scam.
Lloyds refused to refund any of the payments Miss R made in relation to the scam it said it 
gave her adequate warnings, but she continued to give false information that disguised a 
scam was taking place. 
Lloyds did try to recover the payment Miss R made to a third party on 22 February 2022 but 
was unfortunately unable to.
Our Investigator considered Miss Rs complaint but thought Lloyds had acted fairly deciding 
not to refund the money Miss R had lost. As Miss R disagreed this complaint has now been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Recovery of the payments Miss R made
A payment was made by Miss R to a third party on 22 February 2022. Lloyds has attempted 
to recover this payment by contacting the third-party bank as we would expect. 
Unfortunately, these funds have already been moved on and the recovery attempt failed. 
The remaining payments Miss R made were made to accounts in her name. When 
payments are made to accounts in the name of the person that is sending the funds Lloyds 
has no means of recovery
Should Lloyds have stepped in and prevented the payments being made?
Miss R has accepted she authorised the payments she made from her Lloyds account in 
relation to the scam, so the starting point here is that Miss R is responsible. However, banks 
and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of 
financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard 
against money laundering.
The question here is whether Lloyds should have been aware of the scam and stepped in. 
And if it had stepped in, would it have been able to prevent the scam.
As we would expect Lloyds did step in on 16 February 2022 when Miss R started to make 
larger payments in relation to the scam to Coinbase, and several conversations took place 
between Lloyds and Miss R. I have listened to all the available call recordings.
Miss R told Lloyds several times that the payments she was making were to an account in 
her name. She said she had not been in contact with a third party about the payments andhad not downloaded any screen sharing software. Payments were stopped several times 
and every time Miss R gave the same inaccurate information about the payments she was 
making, despite Lloyds warning about scams and even stating definitively that if Miss R had 
been asked to download screen sharing software, or been in touch with someone else about 
the payments, that it would be a scam.
With the above in mind, I think Lloyds stepped in and gave fair warnings about the risks 
involved in the payments Miss R was making. I am not convinced that any amount of 
intervention by Lloyds would have prevented Miss R falling victim to this scam.
So, I dont think Lloyds missed an opportunity to prevent the scam taking place and it is not 
responsible for Miss Rs loss. So, it doesnt have to refund any of the payments Miss R 
made.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 May 2023.
