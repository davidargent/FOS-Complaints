Mr P says that he was taking out new loans with Sunny to pay his existing debt and that 
his debts spiralled out of control. He says that his financial situation wasnt properly checked 
before each loan was provided.
Sunny says that although Mr P took out a number of loans with it there were breaks in the 
lending of at least three pay cycles and the contractual repayments were for less than 15% 
of his income. It says that before each loan was provided it carried out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks and that Mr P didn't show any signs of not being able to afford the 
repayments.
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans four to 26. He said that he 
hadn't seen enough evidence to say that loans one to three shouldn't have been provided. 
He said that the repayment of loan four represented a significant amount of Mr Ps income 
which meant there was a significant risk that Mr P wouldn'tt be able to meet his existing 
commitments without borrowing again. By loan six, our adjudicator thought that a pattern of 
borrowing had emerged that suggested Mr P was persistently reliant on short term 
borrowing. 
Sunny didn't accept our adjudicators view. It provided a counter offer to Mr P. Mr P 
didn't accept this offer and so this complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
issue a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Our adjudicator didn't think that loans one to three should be upheld. The parties didn't 
comment on these loans being rejected so I dont need to look at these loans again. 
Although I will look at Mr Ps full lending history with Sunny to assess the case fairly.
Loan four was taken out on the same day that Mr P repaid loan two. However, loans one 
and three were still outstanding. By this point the combined payments for Mr Ps outstanding 
loans with Sunny accounted for a significant amount of his £1,000 monthly income. The only 
loan that had been repaid was the smallest (£100) and on the same day Mr P took out a loan 
for £300. Given the size of the combined repayments compared to Mr P's income, I find at 
this point Sunny should have been concerned that Mr P wouldn't be able to make his 
repayments in a sustainable way.
Mr P did then repay loans three and four but took out a fifth loan while the first was still 
outstanding and I dont think there is anything to suggest Mr Ps situation had change at this 
time. 
Based on the above, I do not think that loans four and five should have been provided as I 
think it unlikely that Mr P was able to sustainably repay these loans.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that 
it shouldn't have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six.
By loan six, Mr P had taken out six loans in four months. I note Sunnys comments 
about the gap between when loan six was repaid and loan seven provided. The gap 
was for around three and a half months and followed a period of over four months of 
lending. So while I recognise the point made by Sunny, I do not find in this case that 
the gap means that Sunny should have considered Mr Ps circumstances had 
changed and so I do not find that this gap means a new lending chain began.
 At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr P was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr P was taking out loans shortly after, or before previous loans 
were repaid. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr P was 
having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ps first loan was for £250 and loan six was for £450  and also overlapped with 
loans one and five. At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr P was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
 
From loan six onwards Mr P's pattern of borrowing didn't change and he wasnt 
making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. 
 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans Mr P borrowed was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr P's ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
 
Because of the above, and the reasons I have set out regrading loans four and five,  I am 
upholding this complaint from loan four to 26.
Putting things right
refund all interest, fees and charges Mr P paid on loans four to 26 (inclusive);
 
pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
 
remove any adverse information regarding loans four and five from Mr P's credit file;
 
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans six to 26 should be 
removed from Mr Ps credit file.
 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International Limited to take off tax from
this interest. Elevate Credit International Limited must give Mr P a certificate showing how
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
 
 
My final decisionFor the reasons above, I am partially upholding Mr P's complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right for Mr P as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
