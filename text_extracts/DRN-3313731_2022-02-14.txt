The complaint
Mrs G complains AXA Insurance UK Plc declined a claim for damage to her Park Home.
All references to AXA also include its agents.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
AXA declined Mrs Gs claim. In its final response, AXA referred to a section of the 
policy which says, under subsidence, it will not cover loss or damage to decking 
unless the Park Home has been damaged at the same time by the same cause
From site inspections AXA said due to inadequate drainage, water had collected 
under the Park Home, exacerbating the softness of the ground, causing the decking 
posts to move
But Ive not seen anything that persuades me the Park Home itself has been caused 
damage 
AXA is entitled to rely on expert opinion - and Ive not seen anything to contradict 
what it has said. Parts of AXAs report are also consistent with comments Mrs G 
provided from her own contractor regarding water logging 
I dont think AXAs conclusion is obviously wrong and therefore I dont think it has 
acted unfairly in declining the claim
Mrs G has said the policy is unfair as she couldnt buy a home without the decking. 
While I appreciate the homes may all come with decking, I think the policy clearly 
sets out that they are defined separately
So for these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Gs complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
