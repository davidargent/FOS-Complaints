DRN-1891401
 
The complaint
Mr and Mrs V complain that Nationwide Building Society mis-sold them a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on 1 April 2020. A copy of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision set out the background to this complaint. It explained why I didnt 
think that Mr and Mrs Vs complaint should be upheld.
Nationwide had nothing further to add and Mr and Mrs V didnt respond to my provisional 
decision with any further comments or information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr and Mrs Vs case.
As neither Nationwide nor Mr and Mrs V have provided me with any further comments or 
information following my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the conclusion I 
reached in it.
So I still dont think the complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I dont uphold this complaint 
against Nationwide Building Society.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V and Mrs V to 
accept or reject my decision before 7July2020.
