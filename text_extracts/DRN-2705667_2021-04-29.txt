The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) shouldnt have applied a 
default against him.
What happened
Mr B had an account with NatWest since 2011. He was in financial difficulty. He entered into 
an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA) in February 2014. In April 2016, NatWest applied a 
default to his credit file for a debt of £299.
Mr B complained. NatWest was a creditor in the IVA. The account had been run down to a 
zero balance in 2014. The debt was due to charges and interest mounting up. He had asked 
for the account to be closed in 2014, but this hadnt happened. If theyd closed the account, 
the debt wouldnt have arisen. So, the default shouldnt have been applied. He had tried to 
get this removed over a long time without any success. He had suffered a lot of stress and 
anxiety as a result  and couldnt get any credit. 
NatWest said the debt had been written off in 2016  but this was as a gesture of goodwill. 
So, there was a debt in default, and this had to be advised to the credit reference agencies 
(CRAs)  they had an obligation to do this. They had no record of Mr B contacting them in 
2014 to ask that the account was closed. So  they rejected Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B brought his complaint to us. Our investigator looked into what had happened. She 
could see that by November 2013, the balance on Mr Bs account was £0.62. So  it was 
likely that he wanted it to be closed. In March 2014, a charge of £15 was made  and this led 
to an unauthorised overdraft, and then further interest and charges. So, by October 2016, 
the balance was £299 debit. But as this was made up of charges and interest, it didnt 
represent Mr Bs payment history and the balance shouldnt have been registered as a 
default. There was another default with another lender on Mr Bs credit file  so she couldnt 
be certain it was NatWests default that had stopped Mr B from getting credit. She agreed 
with NatWest for the default to be removed and for a compensation payment of £200.
Mr B disagreed. He accepted the removal of the default  but said that the stress caused by 
NatWest warranted a higher payment than £200.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr B is coming from. He went through an IVA in 2014  and thought that 
everything was then dealt with and behind him. He says he asked NatWest to close his 
account then. The balance was only a few pennies. But then charges and interest ran up a 
debt of £299. And NatWest then registered this as a default on his credit file  in 2016. So  
his life was badly affected by this and he couldnt get any credit. He told us his marriage was 
affected and ended in divorce.
My role here is to ensure the right outcome is arrived at  considering what weve heard from 
both Mr B and NatWest.
Ive seen that in March 2014, the balance on Mr Bs account was only £0.62. But in 2013 
and before that, there was some borrowing. So  what then happened was that charges and 
interest were debited to the account. Monthly charges then compounded - and by November 
2016, the balance was £299 debit. NatWest wrote this off as irrecoverable  but the money 
was owed by Mr B, so they registered a default. Ive seen they wrote to him six times in 2015 
and sent him a letter of demand  so he shouldve been aware of what was happening. Mr B 
says he asked that his account be closed in 2014  but NatWest say they have no record of 
that. And weve not seen anything in NatWests records to show he contacted them during 
that time. We can see that Mr B contacted NatWest in 2016  after the default was 
registered.
But  after discussion with our investigator, NatWest agreed that it was more likely than not 
that Mr B did intend that the account was closed in 2014. So  NatWest agreed to remove 
the default from Mr Bs credit file  as if the debt didnt occur. That is a fair outcome I think. 
NatWest also agreed to pay compensation of £200. Mr B doesnt consider this to be enough 
 for the stress caused him over the years. But equally, like our investigator, I can see there 
was another default from another lender on his credit file  registered in July 2015. It is for 
prospective lenders to make their own judgments about how they view whats on a credit file 
 but its equally likely that Mr B was declined for credit as much by this other default as 
NatWests  but we just dont know for certain.
The subject of how much compensation is appropriate is a subjective one. In this case, we 
must balance the effect that this has had on him  with the uncertainty of what Mr B asked of 
NatWest in 2014. And  NatWest have agreed to remove the default, which means that Mr 
Bs credit file will be clean after six years - by July 2021  which I think is his main priority.
Looking at whats happened here, I have to say that the offer of compensation of £200 is 
about the right amount that this service would expect to see for what happened. I can 
appreciate that Mr B wont agree with this and will be disappointed. But my decision is that 
NatWest dont need to do anymore here.
If Mr B wishes to accept NatWests offer of compensation of £200, he should get in touch 
with them to arrange for it to be paid to him.

My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. If Mr B wishes to accept the offer of £200 from National Westminster Bank Plc, he should get 
in touch with them to arrange payment.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 May 2021.
