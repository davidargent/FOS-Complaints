The complaint
D complain that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) handled a chargeback request 
incorrectly. 
What happened
In August 2019, D received a non-receipt chargeback claim against them after theyd sold 
a personalised gift online in July. The chargeback claim was found in favour of the buyer in 
November 2019, who said they hadnt authorised the transaction. In addition to the money 
being given back to the buyer, D were also charged a processing fee by PayPal of £14.00. 
D complained as they had provided documentation to show the item had been received and 
signed for by the buyer at the address given at the time of purchase. They were unhappy as 
PayPal didnt appear to give sellers any level of protection where a payment has been made 
through a card issuer and not 100% through PayPal. They also wanted to know the reason 
why the case was found in the buyers favour as PayPal had only given the reason as 
other. 
D were also unhappy with PayPals communication with them throughout their complaint. 
PayPal explained that the chargeback process is external to their system. They said if a 
customer raises a chargeback claim with their credit card company, PayPal have no way of 
stopping the claim as its handled by the card issuer. The card company gives their customer 
120 days to dispute the charge once it shows on their statement, and then tells PayPal about 
the claim via their website. 
While PayPal disputed the chargeback on behalf of D, its the card issuer who determined 
the outcome and only they would know the reason why it wasnt successful. PayPal 
explained that D was ineligible for seller protection. The reason they was ineligible was 
because the purchase was made by a direct card payment, or a website payment pro 
payment. The system logged this reason as other. 
Even though they admitted no error on their part, as D are a valued customer, PayPal 
agreed to credit them with £68.99 which covered the cost of the item and the processing fee. 
Our investigator was initially of the opinion that PayPal hadnt done enough to defend the 
chargeback claim. He asked them whether they had escalated the chargeback request to 
the arbitration stage when it didnt fall in Ds favour. PayPal explained they wouldnt defend a 
chargeback to arbitration stage but would instead review the sellers eligibility for seller 
protection. 
While our investigator agreed that PayPal werent responsible for deciding the outcome of 
the chargeback, and while they did dispute it, he felt they could have done more to assist. 
Given the amount of evidence provided, and knowing that D werent eligible for seller 
protection, our investigator believed PayPal should have taken the claim to arbitration to give 
D another chance to defend the chargeback. 
Because of this, he asked PayPal to pay D £100 for the poor customer service given. 
PayPal disagreed. They maintained the outcome of the chargeback claim is decided by the 
card issuer meaning they have no way of stopping it. 
After reviewing the case again, our investigator asked for further information from PayPal 
and changed his view. He explained to D that upon review, he felt PayPal had done enough 
in relation to defending the chargeback. He explained that it was PayPals bank who was 
responsible for defending the chargeback and that as long as PayPal had provided their 
bank with the documentation needed for the defence, they had done enough. 
PayPal provided evidence to show they had sent their bank all of the information provided by 
D. As they had done this and given D back the cost of the item and processing fee, our 
investigator was of the opinion they had acted fairly. 
D didnt agree, and so the complaint has been passed to me for review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, I agree with the investigator for the same reasons. Ill explain 
why. 
Looking through whats been provided by D, I can see that the personalised item was 
shipped and tracked, and that it was signed for by the buyer. The name of the buyer has 
been given, and the shipping address matches the billing address. 
So given all of this, I feel there was a significant amount of information available to suggest 
this transaction was authorised and that it was delivered and signed for by the buyer. 
D have said that PayPal should have done more to assist them with the chargeback and that 
they should have escalated it to arbitration knowing there was no seller protection in place. 
However this isnt the role of PayPal. 
To explain, if a customer of D wishes to raise a chargeback, they will raise it with their own 
bank directly. Their bank will then contact PayPals bank and ask whether or not they wish to 
defend the chargeback. PayPals bank will ask PayPal to send them any evidence to use as 
a defence, and they will then send this onto the customers bank. 
As PayPal are a payment processor, they do not hold the role of defending a chargeback. 
Their bank is responsible for this. PayPals role is to provide their bank with evidence from 
their customer (D) so they can put forward a defence. 
I have seen evidence from PayPal clearly showing that they did send all of the evidence 
provided by D over to their bank. And as they did that, I cant say that they should have done 
anything further. I understand D are unhappy that PayPal didnt do more to defend the chargeback and take it 
to arbitration as they knew seller protection wasnt in place, but I hope I have explained 
above why they wouldnt be able to do this. 
PayPal have refunded the cost of the item and the processing fee, and I think that is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. Because of this, I wont be asking them to do anything 
further. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2022.
