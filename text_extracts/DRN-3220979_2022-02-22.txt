The complaint
Ms M complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC provided her with a loan that she was unable to 
afford to repay. 
What happened
Ms M was provided with the following loan by AvantCredit
Loan ref: Date taken Amount Term 
monthsMonthly 
paymentAmount 
repayableDate repaid
174005 14/12/2015 £8,400 60 £295.40 £17,723.97 outstanding
AvantCredit carried out a credit search, obtained a months bank statement from Ms M and 
independently verified her income. Ms Ms intention was to pay off existing loans and some 
accrued debts.
Ms M got into difficulties with repaying the loan in mid-2016 and she then suffered a 
reduction in her income. She reached an arrangement with AvantCredit over repayment of 
the loan in June 2018. She believes her circumstances at the time of the loan being issued 
meant that AvantCredit shouldnt have given her the loan.
AvantCredit said its checks and documents obtained indicated to it that the loan was 
affordable.
On referral to this service our adjudicator said that AvantCredit had made a fair lending 
decision.
The matter has been passed to me for further consideration.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to consider whether AvantCredit completed reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Ms M would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way and/or without 
experiencing significant adverse consequences. Then taking that into account I have to 
consider whether in the circumstances AvantCredit made a fair lending decision. 
I must emphasise that Im concerned here with the decision in December 2015 by 
AvantCredit to lend Ms M the money set out above. I fully appreciate that later her 
circumstances changed and at that stage she found herself unable to make the full 
repayments. She had to make a payment arrangement with AvantCredit. However I have to 
consider the information available to AvantCredit in December 2015 and whether. taking that 
into account, it made a fair lending decision.
AvantCredit carried out a credit check, verified Ms Ms income and obtained her latest bank 
statement. Ms M also completed an application setting out her income and outgoings. These 
disclosed that she had an income of £1,991 per month, and after outgoings a disposable 
income of around £1,225 per month. Her bank statement verified that information. She was 
overdrawn but it didnt show any difficulties with payments. She advises that it was her 
intention to pay off some debts and existing loans. Her representative advised that During 
the period of approval of her AvantCredit loan she was also approved loans with multiple 
other lenders at the same time. The credit report didnt show that and if Ms M was taking 
out other loans it was her responsibility to advise AvantCredit of that.
I think AvantCredit carried out reasonable and proportionate checks and that those checks 
didnt alert it to the need to carry out further checks. As Ive said, I appreciate that Ms Ms 
circumstances worsened after the loan was issued, and the up to date credit report her 
representative has supplied shows this. But in light of the circumstances shown at the time 
of taking out the loan I think that AvantCredit made a fair lending decision.
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
