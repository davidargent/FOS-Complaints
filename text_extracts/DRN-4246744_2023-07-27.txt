The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
What happened
Mr H had one loan from NatWest in July 2022 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue
1 7 July 2022 £10,000 48m £268.89 28 Jun 2026
Mr and Mrs T, on behalf of their son, Mr H, complain that NatWest approved a loan 
application for their son without due diligence. They say Mr H had recently been hospitalised 
for a mental health condition and, shortly after his release, hed applied for the loan on his 
phone. They add that he used the money, along with £4,000 of his savings, to purchase 
crypto-currency. Mr and Mrs T say that NatWest should not have allowed such a transaction 
and that the currency was later stolen from Mr Hs crypto wallet. Mr and Mrs T say the 
situation has exacerbated their sons poor mental health and caused them both stress and 
anxiety. In addition, they say, NatWest said the account would be frozen on 12 October 
2022, but that this did not happen until 28 November 2022. They would like NatWest to 
cancel the loan and reimburse the £10,000 along with the additional £4,000.
NatWest says it checked Mr Hs credit score and verified his declared income and outgoings 
before approving the loan automatically. It says the loan was fairly assessed, but as a result 
of the information about Mr Hs mental health, the repayments have been suspended, 
pending a discussion about support going forwards.
Our investigator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She found no evidence 
that NatWest was made aware of Mr Hs mental health issues prior to lending and was 
satisfied that the affordability checks it carried out were proportionate and indicated the 
repayments were sustainable. Our investigator reminded NatWest of its duty to treat Mr H 
fairly when setting up an affordable repayment plan.
Mr T responded to say, in summary, that he did not believe the investigator fully considered 
all the evidence originally presented. In particular Mr T said:
Due diligence from NatWest would have identified:
oMr Hs income was from Personal Independent Payments (PIPs) (which could 
indicate a long-term mental health issue);
oHis spending was erratic  potentially a warning that Mr Hs capacity to make 
rational financial decisions was compromised;
The lack of interaction required prior to lending was an irresponsible position to hold 
in relation to NatWests duty of care to vulnerable customers;
Lenders should display additional diligence when they identify that incoming benefit 
payments are PIPs, as the nature of such payments could indicate an issue with 
regard to rational financial decision making;
He expects NatWest to continue to freeze interest charges on the account until the 
complaint has been fully considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
Bearing this in mind, in coming to a decision on Mr Hs case, I have considered the following 
questions:
Did NatWest complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing Mr Hs 
loan application to satisfy itself that he would be able to repay the loan in a 
sustainable way? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did NatWest make a fair lending decision?
Did NatWest act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Loan affordability
When Mr H applied for the loan, NatWest checked his credit file and verified his income and 
expenditure. These checks showed:
Mr H said he was living with his parents;
A verified income of £1,100 per month;
No adverse information on Mr Hs credit file;
Over £570 of disposable income each month.
I accept that all these checks were carried out automatically, but Im satisfied the information 
showed that the application met NatWests loan criteria and that there was nothing that 
should have indicated to NatWest that it needed to carry out further checks.
So, I consider NatWest carried out reasonable and proportionate checks and made a fair 
lending decision based on the available information.
VulnerabilityI have carefully considered whether NatWest should have done anything differently with 
regard to Mr Hs specific vulnerabilities and its loan decision. However, I am not persuaded 
that it did anything wrong by approving the loan in the way that it did because:
Ive seen no evidence to suggest that NatWest had been informed, before he applied 
for the loan, that Mr H may have difficulty making rational financial decisions;
Although Mr Hs bank statements showed his income was derived from benefits, 
NatWest has confirmed its able to accept benefit payments as a form of income and, 
indeed, the income verification process was to ensure the monthly income received 
matched the declaration from Mr H in value only;
As such, the automated system would not have flagged that the income was primarily 
a PIP payment;
I am satisfied that NatWest followed its own processes when deciding to approve the 
loan.
That said, I have also considered whether NatWest should have done anything differently 
given the information it already had about Mr Hs circumstances  in particular Ive 
considered what Mr T said about the nature of PIP payments and his sons erratic 
expenditure.
I accept that a person can be in receipt of PIP payments if they:
have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability;
have difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around;
So while it could indicate that financial management may be difficult, there are many 
different reasons that a person may be in receipt of PIP payments. I acknowledge, however, 
that Mr T says NatWest should have used that information to be more diligent about Mr Hs 
loan application and, by implication, establish the reason he receives such a payment.
The relevant guidance from the Financial Conduct Authority says:
A firm should assume a customer has mental capacity at the time the decision has to be made, 
unless the firm knows, or is told by a person it reasonably believes should know, or reasonably 
suspects, that the customer lacks capacity.
and
A firm should not unfairly discriminate against a customer who it understands, or reasonably 
suspects, has a mental capacity limitation, in particular, by inappropriately denying the customer 
access to credit.
Given that it had not been flagged to NatWest that Mr H may have difficulty with financial 
management, it would have no reason to think that the PIP payment would be relevant to the 
lending decision. Even if it did, Im not persuaded that a different lending decision would be 
the outcome given the affordability information and the FCA guidance.In short, I dont find NatWest was lacking in its due diligence in this case, nor that its 
automated loan assessment was, by definition, irresponsible.
I do note that NatWest did initially charge further interest after it said it would freeze the 
account, but Ive seen evidence that this was refunded, and that NatWest has agreed that 
the account will remain frozen pending the outcome of this case.
Finally, with regard to the question of whether NatWest should have allowed Mr H to use the 
loan money, plus more, to purchase crypto currency, this would need to be the subject of a 
separate complaint. As such, I wont consider this aspect here, but I understand Mr and 
Mrs T are considering whether to raise an additional complaint about NatWests 
responsibilities.
In summary, I find NatWest made a fair lending decision and it did not act unfairly or 
unreasonably in any other way. However, I would remind it that, now it is aware of Mr Hs 
vulnerability, it should consider the management of the loan in that context going forwards.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2023.
