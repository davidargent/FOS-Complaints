DRN-1431963
 
The complaint
U is a limited company and complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited (WorldPay) closed its 
account and withdrew services after it was dissolved due to an administrative error. 
U also complains that WorldPay declined its application for a new account. 
What happened
U was a customer of WorldPay and used its services to take card payments. U has 
explained that due to an employees failure to submit information on time it was temporarily 
dissolved on 6 August 2019.
On 14 August 2019 WorldPay closed Us account. U has told us there was as short delay 
when paperwork required to make the company active again was sent to the wrong place. 
Us limited company status was reactivated on 17 September 2019. 
WorldPay told U it needed to reapply before services could be restored. But Us application 
wasnt successful and it complained. 
WorldPay responded on 1 October 2019 but didnt agree it had made a mistake. WorldPay 
said the limited companys status was dissolved between 6 August 2019 and 
17 September 2019 which meant U had to reapply for its services. WorldPay said it had 
correctly taken the decision to decline the application. 
U referred its complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. She thought 
WorldPay had dealt with the complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. U asked to 
appeal so its complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Us position came about as a result of an employees failure to submit 
information on time and that it took swift action to resolve the dissolved status of the limited 
company. Whilst I dont doubt that the problems arose out of a genuine error, I have to focus 
my comments on WorldPays actions and whether it treated U fairly. Ive paid close attention 
to the relevant terms, which set out the relationship between WorldPay and U. 
WorldPay took the decision to stop providing services on 14 August 2019 after it was notified 
U had been dissolved. Once a business is dissolved it ceases to exist. I understand U took 
action to have its active status reinstated, but that didnt happen for several weeks. I wont 
quote the terms in full as I can see the investigator has already set out the relevant section in 
their findings. But the terms say that U needed to ensure it had a permanent business 
registration, abide by the relevant accounting principles and pay all relevant taxes. As Ive 
said, I understand the reason U was dissolved was due to a genuine error and I can see it 
took steps to resolve the situation. But Im satisfied that WorldPays decision to withdraw its 
services was reasonable and in line with the terms. 
WorldPay received Us application on 18 September 2019 and declined it on 23 September 
2019. WorldPay says it takes a range of factors into account when considering whether to 
approve an application, including previous account conduct, a business financial position 
and its potential liability. WorldPay is free to decide whether to provide its services based on 
its commercial judgement. I understand WorldPay had previously provided card payment 
services to U, but that doesnt mean it had to accept the application it received on 18 
September 2019. Whilst I understand why U found the decision difficult to understand, I 
havent been persuaded WorldPay treated it unfairly or made a mistake by declining the 
application. 
Im sorry to disappoint U but I havent been persuaded that WorldPay withdrew its services 
in error or that its decision not to approve its subsequent application was wrong. As I havent 
found that WorldPay made a mistake and Im satisfied it has dealt with Us complaint fairly, 
Im not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask U to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2020.
