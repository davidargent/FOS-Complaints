The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly declined his application and 
caused delays when he applied to port his buy to let mortgage. 
What happened
Mr J had sold his property and wanted to port his mortgage product within the porting 
window. He found a property to buy, but says he had to wait a month for an appointment 
with a mortgage adviser, despite telling NatWest the matter was urgent. As a result, he 
missed the deadline to port his mortgage product. He had to pay the early repayment charge 
(ERC) and lost the benefit of the interest rate.
Mr Js application was declined when the valuer said the property wasnt suitable security. 
Mr J says the current owners have a mortgage from NatWest and it should provide evidence 
its lending criteria have changed or allow him to port his mortgage product. He said NatWest 
is discriminating between customers.
NatWest offered £250 for poor service when Mr J raised a complaint. It said it couldnt 
discuss another customers mortgage and it had to rely on the expert opinion of the valuer as 
to whether the property is suitable security.
Our investigator said NatWest hadnt acted unfairly when it declined to port the mortgage. 
She said £250 was fair for the poor service Mr J experienced.
Mr J said, in summary, that as valuers can reach different decisions it was for NatWest to 
ensure this wasnt due to discrimination which he said is legally prohibited in all its forms. 
Mr J said making different lending decisions for the same property and different customers 
should be investigated. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest instructed a valuation of the security property to help it to make a decision on 
whether to lend. Id expect it to instruct a suitably qualified valuer, which I think was the case 
here. 
NatWest provided a copy of the valuation report. This says the property is not suitable 
security in accordance with NatWests guidance. The report said the property wasnt readily 
saleable or mortgageable. It said it was above a retail shop which was likely to have a 
significant impact on saleability. 
Mr J queried the valuation. He said hed checked that NatWest didnt have a ban on lending 
on properties above retail premises before applying. He said he thought the valuer had 
disqualified the property without checking the actual use of the premises and asked for a 
revaluation taking this into account.
Mr J says theres a potential case for discrimination or unfair treatment, as the current 
owners have a mortgage with NatWest. 
The Equality Act 2010 provides protection against discrimination for people with a protected 
characteristic. I should explain that we are an informal dispute resolution service, meaning 
we dont have the power to decide whether or not a business is in breach of the Equality Act 
2010, as only a court has the power to do this. What we can do is take relevant law and 
regulation into account when deciding whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of a 
complaint. 
We asked Mr J why he believes there was discrimination here. He says this is very simple. 
NatWest has a mortgage on the property and the vendors have told him (via the agent) 
theyve checked with NatWest they wont have difficulty in re-mortgaging if the sale falls 
through. Mr J says we can check this with NatWest. He says this is evidence any problem 
isnt with the property being suitable security. 
I cant comment on a third partys mortgage account or ask NatWest to do so. Even if the 
vendors expect theyd be able to re-mortgage with NatWest any application for a new 
mortgage would be subject to checks and a satisfactory valuation. 
Mr Js application was declined due to the valuer saying the property isnt suitable security. I 
cant look into any allegation of potential discrimination against the valuer as this complaint is 
solely about the actions taken by NatWest. 
We asked NatWest for information about its lending policy, the guidance referred to by the 
valuer and its communications with the valuer when Mr J challenged the valuation.
NatWest provided an extract from its lending policy, in confidence. If NatWest told Mr J it 
doesnt have a ban on properties above retail premises this was correct. This is provided the 
valuation doesnt identify issues with the building or locality which may affect resale. The 
issue raised by the valuer was about how the location of the property would affect its 
saleability. 
NatWest contacted the valuer after Mr J raised his concerns. The valuer responded to say 
the valuation was unchanged. The response from the valuer reiterates that the location of 
the property affects its saleability and says this is supported by a lack of recent sales of 
similar properties in the area. 
Different valuers might reach different conclusions and for legitimate reasons, especially if 
some time has passed or theres been a change in wider market conditions. 
I dont think, based on the available evidence, that NatWest ought to have been alerted to 
the possibility that the valuer said the property wasnt suitable security for any reason other 
than those given in the valuation report. 
I dont think I can fairly find that it was unreasonable for NatWest to rely on the valuation 
report or that it should have disregarded the expert opinion of the valuer that the property 
wasnt suitable security. It follows that I dont think it was unfair for NatWest to decline Mr Js 
application.
Did NatWest cause delays?
It was unfortunate that NatWest couldnt offer Mr J an earlier appointment with a mortgage 
adviser. Mr J had to wait about a month for an appointment. Mr Js application was declined because the valuer said the property wasnt suitable 
security. This would have been the same if hed met with a mortgage adviser sooner. 
NatWest told Mr J there was a high demand for meetings with mortgage advisers and 
offered the first available appointment. I dont think NatWest treated Mr J unfairly when it 
didnt offer an earlier appointment.
I appreciate that an earlier meeting  and decline  might have meant Mr J applied 
elsewhere sooner, by up to about a month. Whether this would have meant hed have been 
able to secure a mortgage at a better interest rate is unclear. But I dont think NatWest made 
an error or treated Mr J unfairly. It offered him the first available appointment, and declined 
his application based on the valuation. 
It follows that I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to refund the ERC or 
compensate Mr J for missing out on the benefit of the lower interest rate product he wanted 
to port or which might have been available from another lender.
NatWest offered £250 for poor service when it didnt initially respond to all of the concerns 
raised by Mr J. I think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay £250 to Mr J, if it hasnt 
already done so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2023.
