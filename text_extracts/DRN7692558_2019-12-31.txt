K820x#14complaint
Ms H complains that her account with PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA has been  misused.
The result is that payments into the account have been reversed, leaving her with a
substantial debt that PayPal refuses  to write off.
background
Ms H says she was the victim of a sophisticated and fairly long-running scam at the hands  of
her ex-partner. She has explained  the background in some  detail, so I only need to provide a
summary of what shes said about  her ex-partners  activities.  I can assure  her though  that
Ive read very carefully all shes had to say and have no reason to disbelieve  what shes  told
this service about the relationship.
Ms H has explained  that she met her now former partner in early 2015 on a dating  website.
He claimed to be a successful businessman,  and Ms H allowed him to make financial
decisions for them. They decided to buy an overseas property together,  and Ms H agreed to
sell her property and to provide additional  funding for it.
After some time, Ms Hs partner said that his business was experiencing temporary financial
difficulties and she agreed to support him  in the expectation that she would be repaid.
Shortly before her house was to be sold, Ms H concluded  that she had fallen victim  to a
scam and that her partner would not pay her back.
Ms Hs ex-partner targeted several of her accounts, including  her current  account,  mortgage
account and credit cards. But my decision here concerns only the way PayPal has acted,
although activity  on other  accounts is relevant.
As one element of the scam, Ms H says that her ex-partner arranged for money to be
transferred primarily from one of her credit cards to her PayPal account, using its personal
payment service. The money  was then transferred to a bank account linked to the PayPal
account. This happened over a period of nearly  two years.
Some time later the payments were  reported  as suspicious and were returned to their
source. But this left a negative  balance on Ms Hs PayPal account.  PayPal wouldnt write it 
off and Ms H referred the matter to this service.
One of our adjudicators considered Ms Hs complaint and agreed  with Ms H that PayPal
should write off the debt. PayPal didnt  agree,  however,  and asked that an ombudsman
review the case.  I did that and, because I reached  a different conclusion from the 
adjudicator, issued a provisional decision.  
I accepted what  Ms H told us and PayPal about her arrangements  with her ex-partner.  She 
said he had exploited her over a long period and that he had a long-term  motive  to benefit 
financially from their relationship. She had trusted  him and allowed him some control over 
their finances. I said that the complaint needed  to be seen in that context. I noted that a key 
element of the complaint  was that money had been transferred by card payments into Ms 
Hs PayPal account  and then transferred to a bank account linked to the PayPal account. 
PayPal said the personal payment facility should not be used in that way. 
I also noted that most of those payments had come  from one of Ms Hs credit  cards and had 
been reimbursed  by the card provider. Whether or not Ms H had made  those card payments, 
they had been reimbursed. Her losses were therefore largely due to the fact that money was 
Ref: DRN76925582transferred from Ms Hs PayPal account to a bank  account linked to it  which  PayPal said 
was not hers and which I assumed belonged to her ex-partner. 
I thought it likely that Ms H had given her ex-partner access to her PayPal account and that 
she had agreed  to have the account linked to it. I accepted that Ms H probably  didnt know 
exactly what was happening  on her accounts, but I didnt think it would be fair to make 
PayPal reimburse her. 
Ms H responded with further submissions, as Id invited  her to do. In summary,  she said:
PayPal should have cooperated with the credit card company. Had it done so, her 
position would have been  different.  
She didnt agree to add a third partys bank  account to her PayPal account in 2015. She 
only met her ex-partner in April of that year and would not have  agreed  to that. 
A completely new PayPal account  was set up some time later, which  Ms H used for 
selling items in online auctions.  PayPal  withheld and then withdrew funds from that 
account. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, however, I havent  
changed my view from that set out in my provisional decision. 
I note what Ms H says about cooperation between  PayPal and her credit  card provider. I 
dont agree, however, that what she sees as a lack of cooperation left her in a different 
position overall. Thats because the credit card company  refunded the payments it made to 
PayPal. So, instead  of owing money  to her credit  card company, Ms H owed the same 
amount to PayPal. As I indicated in my provisional  decision, Ms Hs losses here arise from 
payments from her PayPal account,  not payments made to it. 
PayPals records indicate that the bank account  was added when she opened her PayPal  
account in 2015. I should  however  correct the statement  that PayPal said it wasnt her 
account. In fact, what it said was that it couldnt  provide  any information about that account 
because Ms H had said she didnt recognise  it. It appears however  that the account was that 
which Ms H said she had added  namely,  her own account. Be that as it may,  for some 
time, the account  was used without any issue. Ms H made and received payments, including 
personal payments  which were transferred to the linked bank account. In that time,  Ms H 
would have seen  the accounts  linked to her PayPal  account and would have had the 
opportunity to remove any she didnt recognise  or agree to. It was only when the card 
payments were recalled  that Ms H raised  any issue with the payments to the bank account. 
This means  that:
money was moved from Ms Hs credit card account to her PayPal  account;  
it was then moved  to her bank account; 
the card payments were then reversed  by her card provider. 
Ref: DRN76925583That in turn means that the funds were both transferred to Ms Hs bank account and 
refunded to her credit card account. It would not therefore be fair if they were  also re-
credited to her PayPal  account, since that would mean shed received them  twice.  
Ms Hs comments  about her new account  were raised after she referred her complaint to this 
service, and she may wish to take this up directly with PayPal. I do note however that 
PayPal would be entitled to offset  money  held to the credit  of one of her accounts against 
money owed to PayPal  on another. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take any further 
steps to resolve  Ms Hs complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial  Ombudsman  Service,  Im 
required to ask Ms H to accept or reject my decision before 31 January 2019.
