The complaint
Ms B complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) lent irresponsibly when they approved her 
credit card applications.
Ms B is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).      
What happened
In September 2016, Ms B applied to NewDay for a credit card. Her application was assessed 
by NewDay and they agreed to provide a credit card account with a limit of £600.
Around mid-2018, Ms Bs account began to demonstrate signs she might be in financial 
difficulty. Contractual repayments were either missed or late. Ms B made no repayments 
between August and December 2018 but began making repayments of £10 per month 
thereafter. 
NewDay transferred Ms Bs account to a debt collection agency in March 2019. Her account 
was returned to NewDay in October 2019 when the account was repaid in full.
In January 2021, Ms B applied online to NewDay for another credit card. Her application was 
assessed by NewDay and they agreed to provide a credit card account, again with a limit of 
£600. Ms B appears to have operated this account with no obvious signs of difficulty.
In June 2021, the CMC complained to NewDay on Ms Bs behalf. They said the account 
NewDay provided to Ms B in January 2021 was unaffordable. The CMC said Ms B had a 
number of credit agreements, many of which were taken over a short period. They thought 
this was a clear indication of financial difficulty and NewDay had failed to complete 
proportionate checks which wouldve revealed that Ms B couldnt afford the lending.
The CMC wanted NewDay to refund all interest theyd charged to Ms Bs account together 
with interest on that amount of 8% per annum. They also wanted NewDay to remove all 
negative or adverse information from Ms Bs credit file.
NewDay responded to Ms Bs complaint in July 2021. They agreed they shouldnt have 
allowed Ms B to open a new credit card account due to the information reported on her credit 
file. They agreed to refund the interest theyd charged of £75.49. But they didnt agree they 
should pay interest of 8% on that figure. They also didnt agree they should remove any 
information from Ms Bs credit file as this was an accurate reflection of Ms B account with 
them.
NewDay also took the opportunity to review the circumstances relating to their agreement to 
provide Ms B with a credit card in 2016. They said that based upon the information Ms B had 
provided and theyd also received from the credit bureau, they hadnt done anything wrong 
when they agreed that application.
Ms B disagreed with NewDays response. So, the CMC referred her complaint to this 
service. Having considered all the circumstances and evidence available, our investigator 
didnt think NewDay had acted responsibly when they agreed to provide Ms B with a credit 
card account in both 2016 and 2021. Our investigator thought NewDay should have 
completed further checks and assessments in 2016, including a detailed review of Ms Bs 
income and expenditure. She believed this would have revealed that the lending wasnt 
affordable to Ms B. 
Our investigator thought NewDay should calculate and refund the interest and fees Ms B 
paid on her credit card, and if this exceeded the initial £600 limit agreed, it should be 
refunded to Ms B together with interest at 8% a year. Our investigator also though NewDay 
should remove any adverse information reported on Ms Bs credit file in respect of both 
cards theyd agreed.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigators findings. They said when Ms B applied to them 
in 2016, her application met their lending criteria and there was nothing within the 
information provided or reported to prompt further checks and assessments.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Ms Bs complaint has been passed to me to consider.
I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I issued a 
provisional decision on 21 June 2022  giving both Ms B and NewDay the opportunity to 
respond to my findings below before I reached a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
Credit card application January 2021
NewDay have agreed they shouldnt have provided Ms B with a new credit card 
account in January 2021, based upon the information reported on her credit file. 
Theyve agreed to refund all interest charged since that account was opened. So, I 
dont propose to cover this aspect of Ms Bs complaint further. 
Ultimately, its always difficult to put someone back in the position they wouldve been 
had a credit card not been given. The money has been lent and Ms B has benefited 
from that. So, I think its fair that Ms B pays back anything shes spent. But I dont 
think it would be fair or reasonable to expect Ms B to incur any associated costs. So, 
I agree NewDay should refund all interest, fees and charges from the point the 
money was first lent.
In the event that the refund of charges and interest results in a balance being due to 
Mrs L (i.e. where theres been overpayments) I would expect NewDay to pay 8% 
simple interest from the date of each overpayment to the date of settlement. If there 
remains an outstanding debt, NewDay should ensure an affordable repayment plan 
is agreed.
The CMC have asked for all associated adverse information reported on Ms Bs 
credit file to be removed. The copy of the credit file provided by Ms B doesnt show 
any adverse information reported in relation to this card. But equally, its important 
that other potential lenders are aware of Ms Bs existing commitments and difficulties. 
Its unclear whether Ms B still owes anything on her account with NewDay. But I 
would still expect this to be reported if she does. However, once the debt had been 
repaid, I wouldnt expect NewDay to leave anything adverse reported going forward.
Credit card application September 2016
The rules and guidance relevant at the time NewDay provided Ms B with this credit 
card were set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC). These required NewDay to carry out an assessment using 
reasonable and proportionate checks to determine whether Ms B could afford to 
repay the credit card in a sustainable way. Those checks needed to be borrower 
focussed and consider whether making the repayments could result in financial 
difficulties for Ms B.
This service believes that any checks needed to consider Ms Bs personal 
circumstances and would usually need to be more thorough:
the lower a consumers income; and
the higher the amount due to be repaid; andthe longer the term of the debt; and
the greater the number and frequency of debts.
Conversely, a less detailed affordability assessment, without the need for verification, 
is far more likely to be fair, reasonable, and proportionate where the amount to be 
repaid is relatively small, the financial situation appears stable, and the debt is for a 
relatively short period.
NewDay have shown that at the time of Ms Bs application, no arrears, public 
records, defaults or debt management programmes were reported. Ms B stated her 
income as £24,000 a year with an additional household income of £35,000 a year. 
There were also no other active cards or payday loans reported.
Given the information above and the level of credit offered relative to Ms Bs income, 
at the time, I dont believe it was necessary or proportionate for NewDay to complete 
further checks and tests in assessing Ms Bs application. The credit offered equated 
to only 2.5% of her stated income. So, Im persuaded that NewDays decision to lend 
to Ms B was reasonable here.
NewDay have confirmed that Ms B did contact them in August 2018 with a request to 
increase her credit limit. However, based upon information available to them at that 
time, they declined to do so.
Summary
As Ive stated above, I do support NewDays decision to uphold Ms Bs complaint in 
respect of their decision to lend in January 2021. And for clarity, Ive laid out my own 
view on redress below. 
I do appreciate Ms B will be disappointed, but I dont agree that NewDays decision to 
provide her with a credit card account in September 2016 was inappropriate based 
upon the information provided by Ms B at the time and obtained from the credit 
bureau. So, I dont propose to uphold that aspect of her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
Despite follow up requests from this service, neither NewDay, Ms B or the CMC responded 
to my provisional decision. And as Ive not been provided with any additional comments or 
information, Ive found no reason to vary from my original findings. So, my final decision 
remains the same.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Ms Bs complaint
I require NewDay Ltd:
where not already done, to refund all and any interest, charges and fees in respect of 
the account opened in January 2021; and
to pay 8% interest on any overpayment from the date of payment until the date of 
settlement, if the effect of refunding all interest, fees and charges results in a credit 
balance being owed to Ms B; and 
to remove any current or subsequent related adverse information from Ms Bs credit file once the outstanding balance had been repaid; and
where an amount is still owed by Ms B, to agree an affordable and sustainable 
repayment plan for that amount.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2022.
