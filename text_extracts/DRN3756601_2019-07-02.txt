K820x#14complaint
Miss S and Mr H have complained about  misleading  information sent to them  by Nationwide 
Building Society about their mortgage interest  rate. They say that if the information  had been 
clearer, they would have switched products sooner. 
Miss S, whos dealt with the complaint throughout, says that Nationwides correspondence is 
unclear and breaches the Perimeter Guidance Manual (PERG) and the Mortgages and 
Home Finance: Conduct of Business Sourcebook (MCOB). To settle  the complaint, Miss S 
and Mr H want Nationwide to refund the difference in interest between  2.19% they were  
paying and the rate of 1.94% which Miss S says she believes they were on.
background
In October  2016 Miss S and Mr H, on the advice of their mortgage broker,  took out a 30-year 
mortgage with Nationwide. For the first 24 months it was on a variable rate product  of 1.44% 
above Bank of England Base Rate (BEBR).  This mortgage product ended on 31 December 
2018.
In October  2016 BEBR was 0.25%,  giving  an overall  interest rate of 1.69%. On 2 November 
2017 BEBR  increased to 0.50, and the mortgage interest rate increased  to 1.94% with effect 
from 1 December 2017. Nationwide wrote to Miss S and Mr H on 4 November 2017 
explaining this. 
On 2 August  2018 BEBR increased to 0.75%,  and the mortgage rate increased accordingly 
to 2.19% with effect from 1 September 2018.  Nationwide wrote to Miss S and Mr H on 11 
August 2018 to inform them of this.
In October  2018, two months before the mortgage  product was due to end, Nationwide  wrote  
to Miss S and Mr H confirming  they could switch to a new product without paying an early 
repayment charge.  The letter said your current mortgage rate is 1.94% which  ends on 31 
December 2018* . (I note there is an asterisk after 2018.)
At the foot of the first page is a note to which the asterisk refers. This says *All figures 
correct as at 31 August  2018.
Miss S says that this letter is misleading,  in breach of PERG and MCOB. It led her and Mr H 
to believe their mortgage was at an interest rate of 1.94%, rather  than the actual rate of 
2.19%. Miss S says that, if the correct  interest rate had been  shown, she and Mr H would  
have switched mortgage products immediately, rather  than wait until the product reached the 
end of its term in December 2018. 
Miss S and Mr H complained to Nationwide, which didnt uphold  the complaint  and explained 
that, if Miss S and Mr H were still unhappy,  they could complaint to us, which  they did. An 
investigator considered  the complaint but didnt think Nationwide had done anything  wrong. 
He thought that the letter sent in October 2018 could have been clearer,  but he noted that 
Nationwide had told Miss S and Mr H on 11 August 2018 that their interest  rate would 
change to 2.19% from 1 September  2018.
Miss S and Mr H asked for an ombudsman to review  the complaint. Miss S maintains that 
Nationwide is in breach of PERG.
Ref: DRN37566012my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator, for largely the same reasons.
Ill explain  first that the Financial Ombudsman  Service isnt a regulator. So although  Ive 
noted what Miss S has said about her perception that Nationwide has breached  PERG  and 
MCOB, enforcing compliance with regulatory breaches (if any) dont fall within  our remit. Our 
role is to investigate individual complaints from customers about their specific  accounts  held 
with a business.
I agree  that Nationwides letter sent in October  2018 could have been clearer in highlighting 
the date from which  the interest rate is shown. But if the letter had been read in its entirety, 
Im satisfied it would, or should, have been obvious  that the interest rate figure was that 
which was in place  on 31 August 2018.  
Im also satisfied that Nationwide told Miss S and Mr H in August 2018 that their interest rate 
would increase from 1 September 2018. So Im not persuaded they were misled  by 
Nationwide about  the interest rate which applied to their mortgage  account.
In the circumstances, I dont think Nationwide is at fault. This means that it would not be fair 
or reasonable for me to order Nationwide to reimburse the difference in interest paid at the 
correct interest rate of 2.19% and the previous  rate of 1.94% for the months  of October-
December 2018  inclusive.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S and Mr H 
to accept or reject my decision before 2 August 2019.
