The complaint
Mr E complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Opus (NewDay) unfairly charged interest on 
his account once his payment holiday ended. 
Mr E wants to continue with his agreed monthly repayment.
What happened
Mr E held a credit card with NewDay. In March 2019, NewDay placed Mr E on a 12-month 
hardship plan as he was struggling financially due to personal circumstances.
In April 2020, NewDay contacted Mr E about next steps. Although Mr E initially told NewDay 
that he was able to resume his normal repayments, he changed his mind when NewDay told 
him the account was closed. Mr E said he would only pay £1 a month towards the balance 
on the account.
During a conversation with NewDay, Mr E mentioned the stress he felt because of the 
coronavirus pandemic, leaving him unable to work. At this point, NewDay offered him a 
three-month payment holiday. The payment holiday was then extended by a further three 
months.
NewDay says that even after the payment holiday ended in mid-December 2020, it told Mr E 
it could help further if he gave it details of his income and expenditure. As Mr E refused this 
assistance, NewDay says it was reasonable to return his account to a normal state which 
included charging interest and fees if there was a balance outstanding and payments werent 
made on time. Once Mr Es account was 60 days in arrears, it terminated the account on 25 
May 2021 and registered the default on 30 September 2021.
The investigator issued his first view upholding Mr Es complaint but then changed it slightly 
following further information from NewDay.
The investigator thought that NewDay shouldve applied the default to Mr Es account in May 
2020. The investigator asked NewDay to refund charges and interest applied to Mr Es 
account between January and May 2021.  
NewDay disagrees with the investigators recommendation. It says that after Mr E was 
placed on the hardship plan in March 2019, he brought his account up to date and 
maintained payments. NewDay points out that it placed the payment holiday on Mr Es 
account in line with its processes. NewDay says that during the call in April 2020, Mr E didnt 
say his circumstances wouldnt change due to financial circumstances but that it was 
dependant on NewDay reopening his account.
As NewDay doesnt agree with the proposed outcome, the complaint has come to me to 
make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so 
using my own words. Im not responding to every single point made by the parties involved. I 
dont intend any discourtesy by this. Instead Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the 
key issues. The rules that govern this service allow me to do this.  
The investigator thought that NewDay shouldve applied a default to Mr Es credit file earlier 
than it did and I agree. Once the 12-month hardship plan ended in March 2020, Mr E gave 
NewDay conflicting information about his circumstances. He initially said he could return to 
making his usual payments but once NewDay confirmed the account was closed, Mr E said 
hed only pay £1 a month. Later in the same call, Mr E said he was off work and suffering 
from stress caused, at least in part, by the coronavirus pandemic. At this point, NewDay 
offered him a three-month payment holiday which Mr E accepted.
Considering the conflicting account Mr E gave, I cant see that NewDay took enough steps to 
explore his true position more deeply. If it had, NewDay wouldve either seen that Mr E was 
still struggling financially in which case agreeing more payment holidays without applying a 
default might not have been appropriate.  Or that he was unwilling to ever pay more than £1 
each month towards his credit card balance meaning that Mr Es relationship with NewDay 
had broken down. 
The payment holidays, while well-intentioned and in line with NewDays processes, only 
served to delay the inevitable. The impact of this is that Mr E will have a default on his credit 
file for longer than was otherwise necessary. 
In all the circumstances, I consider it reasonable to require NewDay to backdate the default 
to 30 May 2020. It should also remove any interest and charges that it applied to Mr Es 
account between January and May 2021. 
I understand that NewDay has passed or possibly sold the outstanding debt to a debt 
collection business. NewDay should tell the debt collection business that the outstanding 
balance is to be reduced by the refund of interest and charges between January and May 
2021. If NewDay needs to buy the debt back for this to happen, I would expect it to do so. 
Putting things right
NewDay Ltd trading as Opus should:
Amend the default date on Mr Es credit file from September 2021 to 30 May 2020;
Remove any interest and charges that it applied to Mr Es account between January 
and May 2021; and
Make sure that the third-party debt collection business is aware of the change in 
default date and the removal of the interest and charges applied to the account 
between January and May 2021.
 My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require NewDay Ltd 
trading as Opus to take the steps outlined above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
