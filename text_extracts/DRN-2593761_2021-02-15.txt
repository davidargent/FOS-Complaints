The complaint
 Mr W has complained that, due to incorrect information provided by Aviva Life & Pensions 
UK Limited, hes incurred unnecessary adviser charges. Mr W would like Aviva to refund 
these charges in full.
What happened
 I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 13 January 2021, in which I provided my 
rationale for upholding the complaint. In summary, I agreed with some of Avivas reasons for 
not paying the sum invoiced by Mr Ws adviser, but disagreed with others. I provisionally 
concluded that Aviva should pay to Mr W a further sum of £135, and also pay him the 
existing offer of £200 in respect of the trouble and upset that the matter will have caused.
That decision is set out below, and begins with the background to the complaint:
Mr W had a pension policy with Aviva, but had ceased contributing to it in 2004. In July 
2019, Mr Ws Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) called Aviva to ask whether premiums 
could be restarted and, in the same month, Aviva wrote to the IFA to confirm that this 
would be possible, but that all unpaid premiums would need to be paid first.
Further communication followed between the IFA and Aviva, in which the IFA asked 
various questions relating to the reinstatement of the policy, up to October 2019, at which 
point Aviva wrote to the IFA confirming the correct information  which was that the policy 
couldnt be reinstated and accept further contributions as any reinstatement would have 
needed to happen within 13 months of the last premium being paid.
In November 2019, Aviva wrote to the IFA, apologising for the confusion caused and 
saying that it was prepared to compensate for reasonable time expended in this matter, 
and asking for an itemised breakdown of the costs incurred by the IFA  and ultimately by 
Mr W.
The IFA said that a total compensation payment of £1,250 should be paid, which 
comprised of £1,150 for the time hed spent on preparatory work and advising Mr W on 
the matter, in addition to a further £100 for paraplanning costs. The IFA said that, as Mr 
W had already paid him from a different pension policy, Mr W should be paid £1,050 and 
the IFA should receive the remaining £200.
Aviva declined to pay the whole amount, saying that it was prepared to pay the costs it felt 
it was liable for  amounting to £443.
Unhappy with this offer, Mr W referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator considered the m plaint should be upheld,
saying the following in summary:
The IFA had confirmed that the sum of £1,050 represented the increase in the 
advice fee for the Aviva policy only  rather than for a separate policy. This had 
been agreed by Mr W.
The investigator was satisfied that this amount had been paid by Mr W to his IFA 
and that it wouldnt have been incurred had Aviva not provided incorrect 
information about his policy.
The amount of £443 which Aviva had paid the IFA had been forwarded to Mr W. 
The difference between this and £1,050 should therefore be paid to Mr W.
The investigator noted that Aviva had already offered Mr W £200 in 
additional compensation for the trouble and upset it had caused. She 
thought this was appropriate in the circumstances.
She noted that Aviva felt that it had already sufficiently compensated Mr W by 
paying his IFA, but the investigator said that Mr W was the complainant here and 
was the one who had suffered financial loss. As such, the investigator thought that 
her recommendation was fair.
Aviva disagreed, however, saying that whilst it noted the figure of £1,050 had been 
quoted, it still considered that it was liable for only £443 of the adviser fees. It also said 
that it would like to see evidence of the charge which had been deducted from Mr Ws 
other policy and evidence of the £443 already paid to the IFA having been forwarded to Mr 
W.
The investigator then sent Aviva the requested information and enquired as to 
whether it would now accept her recommendation.
But Aviva again demurred, saying that it didnt think it should refund any additional adviser 
charges to Mr W. It thought that Mr Ws IFA might have been aware that Aviva would 
reject the claim and so sought to recover the fee directly from Mr W. It therefore thought 
that it was being held accountable for the unusual actions of the IFA. However, in order 
to bring matters to a close, it offered to pay half of the remaining amount claimed for  this 
being
£303.33  if the IFA would be prepared to meet the other half.
The investigator put this suggestion to Mr W and his IFA, but the IFA declined to accept 
the proposal. She asked Aviva whether it was therefore prepared to pay the full 
recommended amount to Mr W.
But Aviva declined to do so, saying that it had made the additional offer as a gesture of 
goodwill rather than an admission of liability. It remained of the view that it was being held 
accountable for unusual charges for this case, but that this was between Mr W and his 
IFA.
As agreement hasnt been reached on the matter, its been referred to me for review.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute here that Aviva provided incorrect information relating to the 
reinstatement of Mr Ws policy, and that the costs unnecessarily incurred by Mr W ought 
to be met by Aviva.
There remains, however, disagreement as to what those costs ought reasonably to be.So to determine the amount Aviva ought to repay, in the first instance the investigator has, 
at my request, asked Aviva for a breakdown of its rationale for the proposed payment of 
£443
of the IFAs fees, rather than the whole sum claimed. It has provided this and Ive set out 
its breakdown, largely verbatim, below. I apologise for the length and amount of detail, 
but if neither Mr W nor his IFA have seen this before, I feel its important that theyre 
aware of Avivas rationale in its entirety, especially given my provisional findings in this 
matter.

Total time agreed: 266 minutes at £100 per hour = £443.33.
Ive carefully considered the assessment made by Aviva of the costs set out by the IFA, 
and would comment as follows on the instances where it has disagreed with those costs.
£100 for paraplanning costs. In the absence of detail as to what this involved, Im 
inclined to agree with Avivas conclusion here.
08/07/2019  I agree with Aviva. This call would have been made in any case.
26/09/2019  I understand Avivas point here, but I dont think it was unreasonable, or for 
that matter unusual in general terms for this type of discussion with a client, for the IFA to 
meet Mr W at his home. And the meeting was primarily to discuss the payment of missed 
premiums so that the policy could be reinstated. I do think its unlikely that it took an hour 
and half for this information to be conveyed and discussed, however, and its likely in my 
view that other aspects relating to Mr Ws finances or the IFAs overall stewardship of Mr 
Ws financial affairs were also discussed. But I do think 45 minutes is probably reasonable 
here, rather than the 30 minutes suggested by Aviva.
09/10/2019  I disagree with Aviva. I appreciate that Aviva might think that ten minutes to 
read the contents of a letter is unreasonable  but in the context of what a busy IFA needs 
to do with such a letter - so both the reading and the processing of a letter - I dont think 
ten minutes is implausible or unreasonable.
09/10/2019  I agree with Aviva here  as Mr Ws IFA would have been advising him, 
whatever the outcome of the reinstatement proposal, I think the suggested time spent 
here of 30 minutes is reasonable.
16/10/2019  I disagree with Aviva. Given that the information was in stark contrast to 
that previously provided, along with the impact that this would have had on the 
reinstatement proposal, I dont think it was unreasonable for the IFA to seek verbal 
confirmation that the new information was correct.16/10/2019  I disagree with Aviva. I dont think this communication with Mr Ws 
accountant to check whether costs had been incurred was unreasonable. Its also likely 
that the IFA sought to instruct the accountant to do no more work on the proposal.
16/10/2019  I disagree with Aviva, for similar reasons given above about the reading 
and processing of either a letter or an email. This doesnt seem unreasonable to me.
11/11/2019 up to 29/11/2019 - I agree with Aviva. This service expects that a certain 
amount of time might reasonably be incurred in bringing a complaint, and it shouldnt 
normally necessitate the involvement of professional services  but where it does, we 
might consider awarding those costs. Given the substance of this complaint, I dont think 
Mr W would have needed professional assistance to be able to raise it and ultimately refer 
it to this service. We can, however, consider the matter of the overall inconvenience a 
consumer has been caused by the matter, and make separate awards in respect of this  
see below.
Therefore, on the basis of the above amendments to Avivas summary of costs, my current 
view is that it ought to have paid Mr W an additional £124. Taking into account that Mr W 
has been deprived of that sum for over a year, I think its fair and reasonable to round this 
up to £135.
Ive noted Avivas offer that it would be willing to halve the remaining costs set out by the 
IFA, but on the basis of my findings as to what I consider Aviva should in fact pay, I dont 
need to make a further finding on this. I also note that the IFA has in any case rejected 
that proposal.
Finally, as Ive mentioned above, we can where appropriate make awards for the distress 
and/or inconvenience which has been caused due to a business mistake. I do think that 
Mr W will have been justifiably both upset and inconvenienced by the belated realisation 
that he couldnt reinstate his policy, which contained valuable guaranteed benefits. And 
although Aviva has taken steps to offer reimbursement for the unnecessary costs incurred, 
I do think that an additional amount is warranted in respect of this.
But Aviva has already offered an additional £200, and as with the investigator I think this is
probably an appropriate sum in the circumstances.
Neither party has submitted any further comments in response to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and in the absence of further commentary from either party, my view 
remains the same as that set out in the provisional decision. 
Putting things right
Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited should pay Mr W a further £135. If not already paid, it 
should also pay Mr W the £200 it has offered in respect of the trouble and upset the matter 
will have caused. 
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold the complaint and direct Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to make payment as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
