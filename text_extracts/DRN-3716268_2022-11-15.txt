The complaint
Mrs N complains about issues with the central heating system that she paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance.
 
What happened
Mrs N used a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance, that she signed in 
June 2013, to pay for a new central heating system. The cash price of the system was 
£2,813.33 and she agreed to make 60 monthly repayments of £73.91 to Barclays Partner 
Finance.
Mrs N complained to Barclays Partner Finance in August 2021 about a number of issues 
with the way that the boiler had been installed  including that the supplier had caused 
damage to her property which had resulted in issues with damp. Barclays Partner Finance 
said that the boiler had been installed in 2013 so Mrs N would need to provide evidence that 
the damage was due to poor installation or product fault. It also said that the supplier had 
given a five year warranty on the boiler which had expired. Mrs N wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that Mrs N 
hadnt raised her concerns with Barclays Partner Finance until August 2021 and the photos 
of the damage that shed provided didnt confirm how it was caused and Mrs N had declined 
to get an independent report to evidence her claim. He said that there was insufficient 
evidence to link the works completed by the supplier to the damage that Mrs N had identified 
or to say that Barclays Partner Finance was liable for the cost.
Mrs N has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that the 
work was shabby and has caused wet walls, damage to the floor in the bathroom and her 
foot went through the floor in her spare bedroom. She says that she was still making 
payments to Barclays Partner Finance when she started her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs N used credit in the form of a loan from Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the 
central heating system (which included the boiler) and, in certain circumstances, 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ns complaint about Barclays Partner Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the central heating system and that Barclays Partner Finances response to her 
claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the 
outcome of Mrs Ns claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the breach of contract about which Mrs N is complaining is that the central heating 
system installation wasnt of a satisfactory quality  but the installation took place in 
2013 and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs N made a claim to Barclays Partner 
Finance until August 2021  which was about eight years later;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect any issues with the quality of the 
installation to have become apparent soon after the installation took place in 2013 
and that it would be reasonable to expect Mrs N to have made a claim to Barclays 
Partner Finance soon after she became aware of any issues;
Mrs N has provided photos of the damage that she says has resulted from the issues 
with the installation but Barclays Partner Finance has said that Mrs N would need to 
provide evidence that the damage was due to poor installation or product fault;
Mrs N says that she cant afford to have the installation inspected by an independent 
expert but, given the time that has passed since the installation took place, I consider 
that its fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to ask Mrs N to provide that 
evidence;
Mrs N says that she was still making payments to Barclays Partner Finance when 
she started her complaint but Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan was 
settled in January 2019  and Barclays Partner Finances liability to Mrs N under 
section 75 would relate to the date of the installation of the system and not the date 
that her loan agreement ended;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the supplier gave Mrs N a five year warranty on 
the boiler but the warranty had expired by the time that she contacted it about her 
issues with the installation;
I sympathise with Mrs N for the issues that shes experienced but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the central heating system installation 
wasnt of a satisfactory quality or that those issues have been caused by a breach of 
contract by the supplier;
Mrs Ns claim may also be time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 but, given that 
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract by the supplier, I havent 
considered that any further; and
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mrs Ns claim has been fair 
and reasonable and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require it to pay for any repairs to the damage that Mrs N 
has identified, to refund to her any of the money that she paid to it under the loan 
agreement, to pay her any other compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ns complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
