K821x#15complaint
Ms U says Bank  of Scotland  Plc (trading as Halifax) mis-sold her a mortgage  payment 
protection insurance (MPPI) policy in April 2002.
background
Ms U took out a plan known as a Total Mortgage Protection Plan (TMPP). TMPP can be split 
into three sections: Mortgage  Repayments  Cover (which is a form of MPPI), Life Cover  and 
Critical Illness Cover  (CIC). Ms U has complained about the MPPI  cover so Ive only looked 
at the sale of this part of the package in this decision.
The policy cost just over £20 each month and it covered Ms U in the event she wasnt  
working due to accident, sickness or unemployment   and it wouldve provided a monthly  
benefit of £344.52 for up to 24 months  following a successful claim.
Our adjudicator didnt  think we should uphold the complaint. Ms U disagreed  so the 
complaint comes to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of MPPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Ms Us case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold. Ill explain  why.
I think its likely  Halifax  made it clear that Ms U didnt have to take out the MPPI and she 
chose to purchase the policy   although I can understand if she cant remember  this 
given how long ago it was.
I havent been able to look at all the paperwork from the time the policy was sold but I 
dont think this is surprising given how long ago the sale took place. However,  I do know 
that the way MPPI was presented in 2002  showed that it was optional, and that a 
customer needed to agree  for a policy to be set up. So Im satisfied the policy  was 
optional and I think its more likely  that Ms U was given a choice  about  the MPPI.  
Halifax recommended the MPPI to Ms U so it had to check that the MPPI was right for 
her and, based on what  Ive seen of her circumstances at the time,  I think  that it was. For 
example, Ms U wasnt affected  by any of the exclusions  to or limits on the MPPI cover   
she told us she was employed  and in good health  at the time of the sale.
Ms U was working at the time and she says she had some  occupational benefits from 
her employers  if she was off work sick  but this doesnt automatically  mean  that the 
policy was unsuitable. This is because if she were unable  to work, the MPPI was 
intended to remove  the additional pressure of maintaining mortgage repayments,  at what  
would likely be a difficult time. And this wouldve  been important to Ms U as she was 
solely responsible  for making those mortgage payments.
The MPPI wouldve  helped to pay the monthly  mortgage costs for up to 24 months  for 
each successful claim  and on top of any other  cover she had and for longer. So I dont 
Ref: DRN43577742think Ms Us existing work benefits  wouldve made  the PPI unsuitable.  And I think it was 
reasonable of Halifax  to recommend it to her.  
  
Its possible the information Halifax gave Ms U about the MPPI wasnt as clear  as it 
shouldve been. But she chose  to take it out to protect herself  so it looks  like she 
wanted this type of cover.  And it seems like it wouldve been  useful for her if something 
went wrong. It also looks like it was affordable. So I dont think  better information about 
the MPPI  would  have  put her off taking out the cover. 
Ive thought about everything else Ms U told us, but these points dont change my decision.  
So Halifax  doesnt  need to refund everything  Ms U paid for it. But Halifax has already offered 
to give Ms U back some of the cost of the PPI. I dont think  it needs to do anything more.  
Halifax will make arrangements  to pay Ms U now Ive issued my final decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, my final decision is that I dont uphold  this complaint against 
Bank of Scotland Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms U to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 February  2019.
