The complaint
Mr N complains about damage charges and an excess mileage charge Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services UK Limited (MBFS) is asking him to pay. 
What happened
In June 2018 Mr N entered into a hire purchase agreement (agreement) with MBFS for a 
new car costing £34,295. 
Everything else being equal, Mr N undertook to return the car to MBFS at the end of the 
agreement and to pay it 14.4p (inclusive of VAT) for each mile he had travelled over 48,000 
and a sum (to be calculated) for damage identified as being outside fair wear and tear. 
On 7 June 2022 Mr N returned the car with a mileage of 54,366. 
On 8 June 2022 the car was inspected by a dealership. The inspection report noted a 
mileage of 54,366 and identified the following damage and estimated repair costs:
screen front (chipped) £32.00
bumper rear (scratched) £210.00
seat base cover RHF (scratched) £174.10
total £416.10
The report states Mr N wasnt present at the time of this inspection, but Mr N submits he 
was. 
On 11 June 2022 Mr N says he received a final summary of charges letter from MBFS.
On 12 June 2022 the car was inspected by MBFS nominated defleet centre. The inspection 
report noted a mileage of 54,370 and identified the following damage and estimated repair 
costs: 
screen front (cracked) £247.70
wheel LHF (preparation marks) £110.00
wheel LHR (preparation marks) £110.00
wheel RHR (preparation marks) £110.00

seat base cover RHF (scratched) £174.10
door aperture seal RHF (damaged) £48.48
ototal £2,238.28
Mr N wasnt present at the time of this inspection. 
On 25 June 2022 Mr N says he received a final summary of charges letter from MBFS. 
On 8 July 2022 Mr N paid MBFS £948.70, broken down as follows:
excess mileage (6,366 miles @ 14.4p) £916.70
chipped front screen £32.00
ototal £948.70
On 14 July 2022, after Mr N had complained about the sum MBFS was seeking from him, 
MBFS sent him a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL MBFS made 
reference to an inspection report dated 26 June 2020, where damage charges totalling 
£1,624.18 had been noted, and that what it was seeking from Mr N was £1,084.92, or 
£1,034.92 if paid immediately.
Its my understanding that the cost of £1,624.18 can be broken down as follows:
screen front (cracked) £247.70
bonnet (dented) £260.00
bumper front (scratched) £210.00
door LHF (dented) £260.00

ototal £2,033.62
On 21 September 2022, and unhappy with MBFS continued request for payment from him, 
Mr N complained to our service. 
Mr Ns complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
MBFS should waive the dented bonnet charge of £260, but it could reasonably seek 
recovery of the other damage charges totalling £856.48. She didnt comment on the excess 
mileage charge. 
Both parties disagreed with the investigators view, so the complaint was passed to me for 
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in December 2022. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill 
concentrate my comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any 
specific point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome. 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
damage charges 
Mr N signed his agreement in June 2018. The terms of the agreement set out that 
the car must be returned at the end of the agreement in line with the vehicle return 
standards. It confirms that an inspection will be carried out by trained technicians and 
goes on to set out the acceptable return standards, beyond which it allows MBFS to 
charge for the costs of either repairing and/or refurbishing the car, or the cost of the 
consequent reduction in the sale value of the car. 
Its clear from the agreement that Mr N was responsible for returning the car in good 
condition. So, Ive considered whether the charges applied by MBFS were fair and 
reasonable. 
The first thing Ive considered is Mr Ns argument that the damage, identified in the 
second report, could have occurred after the car had been inspected for the first time 
and after it was no longer in his custody and was no longer his responsibility. 
Ive considered the type of damage identified in the second report (which MBFS is 
seeking payment for and which wasnt identified in the first report) and the likelihood 
this damage occurred between 7 and 22 June 2022. Now I accept I cant say for certain that Mr N is wrong in his submission. But given 
the nature of the identified damage, that Mr N had travelled over 54,000 miles in the 
car and only three or four further miles were added to the odometer between the two 
inspections, I find on the balance or probabilities that the damage MBFS is seeking 
payment for was present when Mr N first returned the car and was simply not picked 
up by the first inspector. 
Given what I say above, I will now go on to consider whether its fair for MBFS to 
continue seeking recovery from Mr N the damage charges its seeking the recovery 
of. In doing this, I will consider the MBFS vehicle return standards (VRS), supplied 
to Mr N with his agreement and also available online. Along with the vehicle return 
standards set out in the agreement, there are industry standard guidelines published 
by the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) which set out what is 
considered to be fair wear and tear in respect of a vehicle. So, Ive also considered 
these in deciding what its fair for MBFS to charge on return of the car. 
MBFS are seeking from Mr N the following damage charges: 
bonnet (dented) £260.00
bumper front (scratched) £210.00
door LHF (dented) £260.00
bumper rear (scratched) £210.00
bumper rear centre chrome moulding (excessive damage) £128.00
door aperture seal RHF (torn) £48.48
bonnet (dented)
For dents, the VRS says minor dents under 13mm are acceptable, this increases to 
15mm in the BVRLA standards. For scratches, the VRS says that any scratching of 
paintwork that has penetrated to the base coat and cant be polished out is outside of 
fair wear and tear. In the BVRLA guidelines it talks about any scratches under 25mm 
being acceptable unless the primer/bare metal is showing.
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that regardless of whether this damage should be described as a dent or a scratch 
its through the topcoat. This is outside fair wear and tear. 
bumper front (scratched) 
For scratches, the VRS says that any scratching of paintwork that has penetrated to 
the base coat and cant be polished out is outside of fair wear and tear. In the BVRLA 
guidelines it talks about any scratches under 25mm being acceptable unless the 
primer/bare metal is showing. 
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that there is at least one scratch to the bumper which is over 25mm and through the 
topcoat. This is outside fair wear and tear. door LHF (dented) 
For dents, the VRS says minor dents under 13mm are acceptable, this increases to 
15mm in the BVRLA standards. For scratches, the VRS says that any scratching of 
paintwork that has penetrated to the base coat and cant be polished out is outside of 
fair wear and tear. In the BVRLA guidelines it talks about any scratches under 25mm 
being acceptable unless the primer/bare metal is showing. 
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that regardless of whether this damage should be described as a dent or a scratch 
its through the topcoat. This is outside of fair wear and tear. 
bumper rear (scratched) 
For scratches, the VRS says that any scratching of paintwork that has penetrated to 
the base coat and cant be polished out is outside of fair wear and tear. In the BVRLA 
guidelines it talks about any scratches under 25mm being acceptable unless the 
primer/bare metal is showing.
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that there is at least one scratch to the bumper which is over 25mm. This is outside 
fair wear and tear.
bumper rear centre chrome moulding (excessive damage) 
For mouldings, the VRS says that discoloured, loose, cracked, distorted, gouged or 
split mouldings that require replacement arent acceptable. In the BVRLA guidelines 
it talks about scuffs and scratches of 25mm or less being acceptable provided the 
moulding isnt broken, cracked or deformed. 
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that this moulding is deformed to such an extent replacement is appropriate. This is 
outside fair wear and tear. 
door aperture seal RHF (torn) 
For apertures, the VRS says torn aperture seals arent acceptable. In the BVRLA 
standards guidelines it talks about scratches that reflect normal use being 
acceptable. 
Having considered the photograph(s) provided in support of this damage Im satisfied 
that this aperture is clearly torn/split. This is outside fair wear and tear. 
Overall, Im satisfied that all of the six items above fall outside of the VRS fair wear 
and tear guidelines provided to Mr N when he took out the agreement. Im also 
satisfied that they fall outside of industry guidelines for fair wear and tear, provided by 
BVRLA. As such, and subject to what I say below, Im satisfied that MBFS can fairly 
and reasonably charge for these. And for the avoidance of doubt I would add that Im 
satisfied that the sums MBFS are seeking in this respect, again subject to what I say 
below, are both fair and reasonable. excess mileage 
Having considered what both parties have said and submitted, Im satisfied that 
MBFS is entitled to charge Mr N £916.70 for excess mileage calculated on 6,366 
miles (54,000 less 54,366) at 14.4 pence per mile. It isnt entitled to charge any other 
sum in this respect, for example £917.14 calculated on 6,369 miles (54,000 less 
54,369) at 14.4 pence per mile. 
Its my understanding that Mr N has already paid MBFS £916.70 in this respect so 
MBFS should treat this liability as being fully settled. 
other matters 
Its my understanding that Mr N has paid MBFS £32 for what was identified as a chip 
in the windscreen in the first inspection report. Now given that MBFS isnt seeking 
recovery of this sum, and for the avoidance of doubt I think this is the correct thing for 
it to do, this sum should be treated as a credit towards the damage charges Ive 
found (above) MBFS can fairly and reasonably charge for. 
Ive thought about whether Mr N has been caused any distress and inconvenience as 
a result of what MBFS has, or hasnt done, in this case. And having done so I think 
Mr N has been caused some. 
In my view MBFS communications havent been as clear as they could have been. 
For example, I note that MBFS has continued to seek payment from Mr N for 6,369 
excess miles, rather than 6,366, that the first inspection report makes reference to 
the wrong vehicle registration and MBFS FRL makes reference to an inspection 
report undertaken on 26 June 2020. And for this I find MBFS should pay Mr N £100 
which it should treat as a credit towards the damage charges Ive found (above) it 
can fairly and reasonably charge for.
MBFS responded to my provisional decision to say it accepted it.
Mr N responded to my provisional decision to say he didnt accept it. In summary he said:
The car was inspected on 7 June 2022 by a dealership, not 8 June 2022.
He had the car inspected by two agents prior to returning the car to MBFS. Neither 
agent identified any unrectified damage outside reasonable fair wear and tear.
From his own experience cars arent treated particularly carefully once returned by a 
consumer to the custody of a business or its agents.
He is honest, trustworthy and honourable.
He isnt a serial complainer.
Although he can accept that one or two areas of damage noted in the second 
inspection report might not have been picked up by the dealership, or his own 
appointed agents prior to the cars return, he doesnt accept that several areas of 
damage wouldnt have been picked up.
The damage charges, even if he was to accept them, dont reflect the true cost, or 
loss, to MBFS.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.I would like to thank Mr N for his substantive response to my provisional decision. But having 
considered that response very carefully Im not persuaded Mr N has added anything that 
would cause me to change my provisional findings. However, for the sake of completeness, I 
would make the following comments:
I dont doubt Mr Ns honesty, trustworthiness or honour and I accept that he isnt a serial 
complainer/moaner.
I accept that the car was returned on 7 June 2022 and an inspection of it carried out by a 
dealership on the same date. When making reference to 8 June 2022 what I should have 
said was this was the date recorded on the inspection report by that dealership.
I accept, as I said in my provisional decision, that I cant say for certain that Mr N is wrong in 
his submission that the additional damage highlighted at the second inspection may have 
occurred after he returned the car over to the custody of MBFS or its agents, especially in 
the light of the first inspection and report and what Mr N says were two inspections he had 
undertaken himself prior to the cars return to MBFS. 
But I still remain of the view that given the nature of the identified damage, that Mr N had 
travelled over 54,000 miles in the car and only three or four further miles were added to the 
odometer between the two inspections, on the balance or probabilities the damage MBFS is 
seeking payment for was present when Mr N first returned the car and was simply not picked 
up by the first inspector (or Mr Ns own appointed agents).
I think its also worth pointing out that despite the second inspection report highlighting ten 
items of damage not noted in the first inspection report (or any reports obtained by Mr N) 
and one item of damage at an increased cost (compared to the first inspection report), 
MBFS only went on to seek recovery from Mr N the cost of five of the former and none of 
the latter.
Finally, I remain satisfied that the sums MBFS are seeking in respect of damage are both fair 
and reasonable and I see no good reason to direct MBFS to reduce these sums.
My final decision
My final decision is that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK Limited must:
treat the excess mileage charge its seeking recovery of as being fully paid by Mr N
reduce the sum of £1,116.48 its seeking the recovery of from Mr N, for damage, by 
£132, bringing this sum down to £984.48.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
