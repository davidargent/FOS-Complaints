The complaint
Mr D complains that Carnegie Consumer Finance Limited wont refund to him the money 
that hes claimed for an electricians training course that he paid for using a fixed sum loan 
agreement and that it wont cancel the loan agreement. Hes being helped with his complaint 
by a representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Carnegie Consumer Finance, that 
he signed in September 2017 to pay for an electricians training course  the cost of 
the course was £7,145 and he paid a deposit of £50 so the loan was for £7,095 
which he agreed to repay by 43 monthly payments of £165  the loan was interest 
free;
he also signed the course providers registration form to enrol for the course which 
was described as full service electrical installer;
Mr D says that he failed pre-attendance tests in January and February 2019 and that, 
having reviewed a health and safety assignment manual that he received in March 
2019, he became suspicious that he might have been scammed about the course, 
so he sent an e-mail to the course provider to say that he was cancelling the course - 
he also stopped making payments to Carnegie Consumer Finance and complained 
to this service;
our investigator didnt consider that there had been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the course provider so he didnt think that he could reasonably 
ask Carnegie Consumer Finance to cancel the loan agreement as he didnt think that 
it made any error when considering Mr Ds claim;
Mr D has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and says that 
the course providers website is now inaccessible and hes referred to other 
complaints that hes found online about the course provider;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ds complaint about Carnegie Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the course 
provider and that Carnegie Consumer Finances response to his claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ds claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr D signed the registration form for the course and confirmed that he agreed to the 
conditions that it contained, including about cancellation  the course was described 
on that form and he confirmed that hed received the complete course kit, the study 
guide and the plan of the course;
more than a year later he says that he failed some pre-attendance tests, reviewed a 
health and safety assignment manual and became suspicious that he might have 
been scammed about the course so asked to cancel his course  but he had no 
right to cancel the course at the time (the 14 day cancellation period set out in the 
registration form had expired) and Im not persuaded that the course was a scam;
Ive considered Mr Ds description of the way that the course was sold to him and I 
consider that the course was clearly described on the registration form and in the 
course materials and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the course, or the loan agreement, was misrepresented to him;
Carnegie Consumer Finance says that the course provider is prepared to extend the 
course for Mr D and it has described the use that he made of the course between 
September 2017 and March 2019  without making a complaint about it;
Mr D says that the course providers website is inaccessible but the website says: 
We regret to inform you that we are currently not accepting new registrations at this 
time, and that the college and its courses are fully subscribed  and Carnegie 
Consumer Finance says that Mr D has phone, e-mail and address details for the 
course provider and access to its online portal; 
Mr D has referred to other online complaints about the course provider  but those 
complaints arent enough to show that the course provider has breached its contract 
with him or that it misrepresented the course or the loan agreement to him;
I sympathise with Mr D for the issues that hes had with the course, but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the course provider and I consider that Carnegie 
Consumer Finances response to his claim was fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Carnegie Consumer 
Finance to allow Mr D to end his loan agreement, to refund to him any of the 
repayments that hes made to it, to pay him any other compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
Mr D has stopped making payments to Carnegie Consumer Finance so his account is in 
arrears. I suggest that he contacts it about the arrears and the further repayments that will 
be due to it under the agreement and tries to agree an affordable repayment arrangement 
for the amount that he owes to it. If hes experiencing financial difficulties he should explain 
those difficulties to it. Carnegie Consumer Finance is required to respond to any such 
difficulties positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2021.
