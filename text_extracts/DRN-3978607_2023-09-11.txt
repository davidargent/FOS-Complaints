The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as D, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) defaulted its Bounce Back Loan (BBL).
Ds complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr A.
What happened
D had a business current account (BCA) and a BBL with NatWest. Ds BCA included an 
overdraft facility. But in November 2021, NatWest made the decision to not renew Ds 
overdraft facility. Mr A wasnt happy about this, and he wasnt happy that NatWest also 
defaulted Ds BBL with immediate effect. So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to Mr A and explained that Ds overdraft facility hadnt been renewed 
because Ds trading turnover had been too low for NatWest to be willing to continue to 
provide that facility to D. NatWest also explained that theyd attempted to contact Mr A to 
arrange repayment of Ds overdraft for several months but without success, and that 
because theyd been unable to reach an agreement with Mr A theyd defaulted Ds BCA. 
Finally, NatWest explained that when a business account is defaulted, theyre no longer 
willing to provide other banking facilities to that business which means that all other facilities 
are also defaulted  which is why Ds BBL had also been defaulted by them. Mr A wasnt 
satisfied with NatWests response and didnt feel it was fair for them to default the BBL as 
they had. So, he referred Ds complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt NatWest had given Mr A a fair 
opportunity to contact them so that the defaulting of the BCA  and consequently the BBL  
might have been avoided. Because of this, our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr A 
remained dissatisfied, so Ds complaint was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has explained that he was overseas for a prolonged time for personal reasons during 
the period NatWest were trying to contact him about the repayment of Ds overdraft balance, 
following their decision to not renew Ds overdraft facility. And Mr A has explained that 
because NatWest didnt leave any messages when they called, and because their emails 
went straight into his spam folder, he wasnt aware that they were trying to contact him at all.  
I can sympathise with Mr A regarding the difficult personal circumstances he was 
experiencing at that time. But even under such circumstances, it remained Mr As 
responsibility, as the director of D, to have monitored Ds accounts and to have been aware 
of any communication attempts that NatWest were making. Additionally, Mr A was aware  
or should reasonably have been aware  that Ds overdraft was provided by NatWest on a 
short-term basis and was subject to renewal. 
In this instance, when Ds overdraft facility came up for review, NatWest made the 
commercial decision not to offer a renewal of that facility to D. This is a commercial decision 
that NatWest are entitled to make. And NatWest have explained that their decision was 
based largely on an insufficient amount of trading turnover being received into Ds BCA in 
the trading period leading up to the review. 
Mr A has explained that during that period he had often used his personal account to trade, 
and not Ds BCA, meaning that NatWest hadnt based their decision on a correct 
understanding of Ds trading turnover. But I dont feel that its unreasonable for NatWest to 
base their decision on the activity that took place in Ds business current account. And I feel 
it was for Mr A to have maintained Ds business activity within the BCA rather than his 
personal account  which by definition wasnt intended to be used for business activity. 
When a bank such as NatWest takes the decision to no longer provide an overdraft facility to 
a business customer, it would generally be expected by this service that the bank would try 
to contact its business customer. This would allow its customer the opportunity to arrange 
repayment of any overdraft balance which would now considered as being unauthorised 
because of the removal of the overdraft facility.
Having considered all the information available to me, Im satisfied that NatWest did that 
here. And I say this because its evident that NatWest did try to contact Mr A on numerous 
occasions over several months and via a variety of different channels. And Im also satisfied 
that if Mr A had responded to NatWests communication attempts, NatWest would have 
offered him the opportunity to come to a repayment arrangement for the overdraft balance 
such that the defaulting of Ds BCA may not need to have taken place. 
As discussed previously, Mr A has explained that because he was overseas, he wasnt 
aware that Ds overdraft facility hadnt been renewed or that NatWest were trying to contact 
him about this. But as I explained above, it was Mr As responsibility, as the director of D, to 
have remained aware of the status of Ds accounts and of any need to act on Ds behalf. 
And so, while its unfortunate that Mr A wasnt aware that NatWest were trying to contact 
him, I feel that the error here was Mr As, and not NatWests  whom Im satisfied acted as 
would be expected, given that they attempted to contact Mr A over the course of several 
months via several different channels, but received no response.
Furthermore, because Mr A didnt contact NatWest to arrange the repayment of Ds 
overdraft balance, and because Ds BCA was ultimately defaulted as a result, this meant that 
NatWest also defaulted Ds BBL. And this is because NatWest, like many banks, operate a 
policy whereby if theyve taken the decision to no longer offer banking facilities to a customer 
in one regard  such as by defaulting a BCA  then theyre also unwilling to continue to offer 
any other banking facilities to that customer. 
In this instance, this meant that because NatWest defaulted Ds BCA, they also defaulted 
Ds BBL. Again, this is a commercial decision that NatWest are entitled to make. But it 
doesnt follow that because a bank has acted in line with a policy that those actions should 
considered as being fair. And so, Ive thought about whether it was fair for NatWest to have 
cross-defaulted Ds BBL in these specific circumstances. 
However, having done so, I dont feel that NatWest did act unfairly by cross-defaulting Ds 
BBL. This is because I feel that Mr A was presented with a reasonable opportunity to avoid 
the defaulting of Ds BBL  which I feel he could have done by contacting NatWest about D's 
BCA overdraft balance during the months that NatWest were trying to speak with him about 
it. And I feel that had Mr A spoken with NatWest during that time and arranged to repay Ds 
overdraft balance with them, then the defaulting of Ds BCA and the consequent defaulting of Ds BBL could have been avoided. 
Ultimately, I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong here. This is because I feel 
their decision to not renew Ds overdraft facility wasnt unfair and because Im satisfied that 
NatWest gave a fair and prolonged opportunity to Mr A to come to an arrangement to repay 
Ds overdraft balance with them before defaulting the BCA as they did. 
And because I dont feel NatWest acted unfairly in these regards  and because Mr A was 
given the opportunity to avoid the defaulting of Ds BCA that he was  I also dont feel that 
NatWests adherence to their policy regarding the cross-defaulting of Ds BBL was unfair.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr A was wanting, but it follows from all the above that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any action. I hope that Mr A 
will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 October 2023.
