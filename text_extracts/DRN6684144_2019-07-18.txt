K822xcomplaint
Mr D has complained about his mortgage  with HSBC UK Bank  Plc. In particular, he says that 
in March 2019 HSBC said the end date of the mortgage was 31 May 2019 but changed this 
back to the original end date of 30 April 2019.  He was confused about when he had to repay 
the loan.
background 
Mr D had an interest-only mortgage with HSBC taken out in April 2004.  In January 2019 
HSBC wrote to him to say that the loan was due to be repaid  on 30 April 2019. But in a letter 
dated 31 March  2019 HSBC told Mr D that the original loan expiry date was 30 May 2019,  
and that the loan expiry date was 30 April 2019. Mr D was confused  about  this as he didnt 
know whether he needed  to repay the loan by the end of April or May 2019.
After the complaint was brought to us, HSBC accepted it had made  a mistake in the letter of 
31 March 2019  and that the correct expiry  date was 30 April 2019. HSBC  apologised and 
credited Mr Ds account with £50 as compensation for any confusion  hed been caused. The 
adjudicator thought this was fair, but Mr D asked for an ombudsman  to review the complaint. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im glad to see that 
HSBC accepts it made an error in its letter of 31 March 2019. I can see why this caused 
confusion to Mr D. Overall  I think the compensation already paid of £50 is proportionate, fair 
and reasonable for this error. HSBC has also apologised. I dont think it needs to do any 
more than this.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint,  in that Im satisfied the apology by HSBC 
UK Bank Plc and the compensation  already  paid of £50 for trouble and upset is fair and 
reasonable. I make no other order or award. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
