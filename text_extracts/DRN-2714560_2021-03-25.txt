The complaint
Ms G has complained that in 2001 National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold 
her a packaged bank account, called an Advantage Gold account. NatWest charged Ms 
G a monthly fee for the account and provided her with several potential benefits in 
return.
Ms G thinks that NatWest should refund her all the fees she paid for the account and 
add interest.
What happened
Ms G has banked with NatWest for quite a long time. NatWest has sent us its record of 
her account history, which is not in dispute. It shows that:
Ms G opened a fee-free account, initially a student account, in October 1993,
Ms G kept a fee-free account for almost eight years,
in May 2001, NatWest sold Ms G the Advantage Gold account, for which it charged a 
fee, and which replaced her fee-free account,
in December 2014, Ms G switched back to a fee-free account.
I previously sent Ms G and NatWest a provisional decision on this complaint. In that 
provisional decision I explained that I anticipated upholding the case. I gave both parties 
the opportunity to make any further points they wanted me to consider before I reached a 
final decision.
The time I allowed for further comments has now passed. Ms G has acknowledged that 
she has received the provisional decision but has not said anything further. NatWest has 
sent us several additional points to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about packaged bank accounts on our 
website, and Ive used this approach to help me to decide what to do about this case. Ive 
looked into everything that Ms G and NatWest have told us or sent us about the complaint, 
including the comments which NatWest made after my provisional decision, and Ive 
decided to uphold it. Ill explain why below.
Most of the new points NatWest has made concern new evidence it wants me to consider in 
relation to some of the findings I made in my provisional decision. So first, I will repeat the 
key findings from my provisional decision and then describe NatWests new points and give 
my evaluation of them.
Key findings from my provisional decision 
(What follows is very similar, though not identical, to parts of my provisional decision) 
In 2001, NatWest, along with other banks, was allowed to sell packaged bank accounts 
in two ways. It could do so without giving personal advice on an information-only (or 
non-advised) basis; or as an advised (or recommended) sale. Whichever approach 
NatWest used for Ms G, I would have expected it to tell her about the Advantage Gold 
accounts benefits and costs clearly and fairly and to allow her a choice; and in an 
advised sale it would also have had to check if the Advantage Gold account was 
appropriate for Ms Gs needs and circumstances.
NatWest has told us that it sold the Advantage Gold account to Ms G on an information-
only basis, but it doesnt know if it did this over the phone, during a meeting in one of its 
branches or in some other way. Ms G has provided a few more details. She has told us that 
she went into one of NatWests branches to discuss problems she was having with an 
existing loan from NatWest and that while she was there NatWest advised her to buy the 
Advantage Gold account. She has been very clear and very consistent about this and Im 
satisfied that she reasonably believed that NatWest was recommending the Advantage 
Gold account to her. So, I have considered her complaint to be about an advised sale.
Ms G has made one main point in her complaint. Shes told us that during her discussion 
with NatWest about the loan, she mentioned that she was concerned that she had a low 
credit rating and that NatWest advised her that buying the Advantage Gold account would 
improve it. So, she took NatWests advice and bought the Advantage Gold account 
entirely for this reason. She now believes that NatWests advice was incorrect, and that 
the Advantage Gold account had no effect on her credit rating.
Firstly, I would like to confirm that its extremely likely that Ms Gs current belief that 
buying the Advantage Gold account would not improve her credit score is true, as the 
type of account a customer holds does not usually influence his or her credit worthiness. 
In recent correspondence, NatWest has told us pretty much the same thing. It has said 
that all current accounts can have a beneficial effect on a customers credit rating as 
long as they are ran and kept within agreed parameters. Holding a packaged account 
would not affect this. However, the crux of Ms Gs complaint is that she believes that in 
2001 NatWest told her the opposite and gave her incorrect advice.
NatWest has denied misleading Ms G or giving her any advice. Obviously, as I wasnt 
present during the meeting, I cant tell for sure what NatWest said, or didnt say, to Ms G. 
But her version of events is very consistent, coherent and highly plausible. Amongst other 
things she has:
pinpointed her problems with the loan as the sole reason for her visit to the 
branch and pointed out she had no interest in a different bank account,
explained what the loan was for,
provided evidence that she brought these problems to NatWests attention (*)
explained that she was particularly concerned about her credit rating as she was 
considering applying for a mortgage to buy a house (which she did a few years 
later),
explained robustly and credibly that she had no other need for the Advantage 
Gold account.(*) NatWest has denied that it was responsible for the problems with the loan that Ms G has 
mentioned, but I havent seen many details about this dispute from either party. I consider it 
to be a separate matter to the way NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to Ms G, and 
I am not considering it here. This means that Ms G is free to pursue this issue further with 
NatWest if she so wishes. However, I cant give her any advice about this, or speculate on 
how NatWest may respond. Nor do I know if any complaint that she may subsequently wish 
to bring to us about the loan will fall inside or outside the time limits and other rules which 
determine which cases we can consider.
NatWest has argued that in its view Ms Gs credit score should not have been a concern to 
her in 2001. It has pointed out that it allowed her to have the loan and agreed that she 
could have an overdraft. Its said that there is nothing to show that Ms G had a need to 
improve her credit score and that she would have been accepted for similar products  
(such as loans and overdrafts)  with other lenders as well.
I do not know the exact state of Ms Gs credit worthiness in 2001, but I havent seen 
anything to make me think that NatWest explained its view to her at the time. And Im 
certainly satisfied from what Ms G has told us that she was concerned about her credit 
score, even if NatWest now thinks that any such concerns were unfounded. I do not find 
NatWests position on this convincing. From the clarity and consistency of Ms Gs evidence, 
I think its highly likely that NatWest gave her incorrect advice that buying an Advantage 
Gold account would improve her credit score.
NatWest giving incorrect advice to Ms G gives me sufficient grounds to uphold her 
complaint, even if NatWest did everything else correctly. But in fairness to NatWest, I 
have also looked to see if there were other factors that could have justified its advice that 
Ms G should buy the Advantage Gold account, or other reasons why she may have 
bought it based on fair information.
In 2001, the potential benefits of the Advantage Gold account included travel insurance 
and extended warranties on some products bought through NatWests banking services.
NatWest also charged customers who held Advantage Gold accounts lower interest rates 
for overdrafts than it usually applied to customers with fee-free accounts.
NatWest has said that Ms G probably bought the account for the lower interest rates on 
overdrafts. To support its case, it has told us that on the day it sold the Advantage Gold 
account to her she increased her overdraft from £1,500 to £2.000and therefore its fair to 
assume that (she) may have been attracted to the preferential interest rate associated with 
a packaged account. I disagree. At that time, the monthly fee for the account was £6 and 
NatWest has told us that it has worked out that in her first year she saved less than £15 in 
overdraft costs. I dont think there was ever a realistic prospect that Ms G would make a 
sufficient saving in overdraft charges for NatWest to recommend the Advantage Gold 
account to her.
Ms G has also told us that at the time in question she rarely travelled (although she did later 
on), so I dont think she needed the travel insurance. Nor do I think that the other benefits 
were of sufficient potential value to Ms G to justify NatWest recommending the account to 
her. Similarly, If NatWest hadnt made a recommendation but had told Ms G clearly and 
fairly about the costs and potential benefits of the Advantage Gold account, I dont think she 
would have bought it as it doesnt seem to have provided anything she wanted or needed.
NatWests new points and my evaluation of them 
NatWest has checked its records for Ms G and has brought several events it hadnt 
previously told us about in detail to my attention. In outline, it has said that:
In March 1998, it approved a loan for Ms G. Between March 1999 and January 2001, it increased the limit on Ms Gs overdraft 
four times.
In March 1999, Ms G requested information about the Advantage Gold account 
and it sent her some promotional material and discussed the account with her. It 
hasnt specified if the discussion was face-to-face or on the telephone, or if the 
discussion took place before or after the request for information.
In February 2001, it had a meeting with Ms G, during which it suggested she 
should take out a new personal loan to repay her existing loan and overdraft.
In April 2001, it sent Ms G some further promotional material on the Advantage 
Gold account 
From Octobers 2002 onwards, Ms G used her bank account while abroad, showing 
that she travelled
NatWest has sent us supporting  evidence for these events and Im satisfied that they took 
place. NatWest has then made three main points. It has said that in its opinion:
Ms G bought the Advantage Gold account as a result of the literature it sent her in 
March 1999 and April 2001; and it did not give her any advice, so it was an 
information-only sale.
The loan and increases to Ms Gs overdraft show that she could obtain credit and 
there was nothing to suggest that (she) had a low credit score and why upgrading 
would improve her score.
Ms Gs travels shows that she had a potential need for the travel insurance that came 
with the Advantage Gold account. 
 I have considered these three points in turn.
It was an information-only sale 
As I said in my provisional decision, Ms G has been very convincing in her belief that 
NatWest advised her to buy the Advantage Gold account.
NatWest has not mentioned any record of a meeting or discussion with Ms G in May 2001, 
when it sold her the account, only the meeting from February 2001 (although it has again 
acknowledged that it increased Ms Gs overdraft limit on the same day it sold her the 
Advantage Gold account). It has pointed out that this meeting was around three months 
before she changed accounts, so it thinks she did so as a result of the literature it sent her 
in April 2001 and March 1999, not as a result of any advice or discussion in May 2001.
These events took place almost twenty years and not surprisingly I cant tell for sure what 
happened. After such a long period of time, I dont think that NatWests lack of records for 
a May meeting or discussion means that such a meeting didnt happen. However, I also 
accept that after this long, Ms G may well have linked different events and mis-
remembered their precise sequence. However, NatWest also seems to have been trying 
to sell the account to Ms G for quite a while, starting with the discussion and literature in 
March 1999. So, I remain satisfied that Ms G felt that NatWest was advising her to change 
accounts.
Ms G did not have a low credit score 
I still do not know, or need to know, the details of Ms Gs credit rating in 2001, and I 
understand NatWests point that she was able to obtain loans and overdrafts and so probably had a reasonable rating. But the key point in this complaint is whether she 
thought it was low and how NatWest responded. 
I would not have expected Ms G to have a detailed knowledge of how credit ratings are 
calculated, and I can understand that from her experience of loans (including NatWest 
suggesting a new loan to replace an existing loan) and increasing overdrafts, she may well 
have been concerned. Even with NatWests new evidence, I do not agree with its position 
that as Ms Gs credit score may well have been reasonable, she wouldnt have been 
concerned about it. 
I think Ms G was concerned, and for the reasons I have given previously, I think NatWest 
probably did advise her that buying the Advantage Gold account would improve her score. 
Irrespective of whether this took pace in the discussion of March 1999, the meeting in 
February 2001 or another meeting in May 2001, it would have been incorrect advice. And 
bearing in mind NatWests position that this was an information-only sale, it would also 
have been misleading information, even if no advice was given. 
Ms G travelled from October 2002 onwards 
I fully accept NatWests evidence that Ms G travelled. However, her first trip seems to 
have been well over a year after NatWest sold her the Advantage Gold account. And I 
dont think any possible need for travel insurance, whenever it took place, mitigates 
NatWest giving Ms G incorrect advice, or mis-leading information, that buying the 
Advantage Gold account would improve her credit score. 
So, in summary, after considering NatWests new information, I still think that it unfairly 
and incorrectly advised Ms G that buying the Advantage Gold account would improve her 
credit score. Had it not given this advice, I dont think she would have bought the account. 
It follows that NatWest should put things right for Ms G by paying her appropriate 
compensation. 
Putting things right
To put things right for Ms G, NatWest should put her into the financial position she would 
have been in if it hadnt sold her the Advantage Gold account.
It should therefore:
refund Ms G all the fees she paid for the Advantage Gold account,
add interest to each of these refunds at the rate of 8% per year (simple) from the 
date Ms G paid the fee until the date it makes the refund (+).
(+) HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. 
NatWest must give Ms G a certificate showing how much tax it has taken if she asks 
for one.
If NatWest can show that Ms G gained financially from any banking benefits that came with 
the Advantage Gold account (such as the lower interest rates for overdrafts) then it may 
deduct the relevant amount from the compensation worked out as above. If it chooses to 
do this, then it must set out its calculation clearly and simply for Ms G, so she can follow 
what it has done.My final decision
 For the reasons I have set out above, I am upholding Ms Gs complaint that National 
Westminster Bank Plc mis-sold her the Advantage Gold account. NatWest should now put 
things right for Ms G by paying her the compensation I have described.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2021.
