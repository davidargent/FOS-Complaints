The complaint
Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M complain that Skipton Building Society has shortened the 
preferential period of a fixed rate mortgage product they applied for in 2017. They say it 
should run for five years from completion, but instead it will end about eight months before 
then.
What happened
In June 2017 Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M applied for a mortgage with Skipton and received a 
mortgage offer on 19 July 2017. Due to problems with the chain the mortgage didnt 
complete within the allowed timeframe and so on 8 March 2018 a further mortgage offer was 
issued. The mortgage completed on 26 March 2018 and is on a fixed rate of 1.82%, running 
until 30 June 2022.
Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M complained to Skipton in 2019 saying theyll be losing out on about 
eight months of the fixed rate as the end date should have moved in line with the delayed 
completion.
Our investigator didnt think Skipton had done anything wrong, and explained the rate had a 
set end date. Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed 
to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I trust Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed their 
complaint in the way that I have. Although Ive read and considered the whole file Ill keep 
my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not 
because Ive not considered it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to 
reach the right outcome. 
The fixed rate Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M applied for was always due to end on 30 June 2022. 
That was explained in the first contractual mortgage offer of 19 July 2017 and the revised 
contractual mortgage offer of 8 March 2018. It didnt matter whether the mortgage completed 
in July 2017 or March 2018, the fixed rate would always run until 30 June 2022. 
Both offers say:
Where you do nothing and therefore your initial fixed rate ends on 30 June 2022, 
your monthly payment is likely to go up. In most cases, the subsequent variable rate 
will be higher. When this happens, well write to you in advance to let you know.
You have requested a repayment loan of £300,000.00 on the fixed rate of 1.82% 
until 30 June 2022 which includes the direct debit discount of 0.25% (F3394).
Your loan will change on 01 July 2022 to the Society's Residential Mortgage 
Variable Rate currently 4.74% for the remainder of the mortgage term which includes 
the direct debit discount of 0.25%.
Interest Rate: the fixed rate of 1.82% until 30 June 2022 which includes the direct 
debit discount of 0.25%.
Your loan changes on 1 July 2022 to the Society's Residential Mortgage Variable 
Rate currently 4.74% for the remainder of the mortgage term which includes the 
direct debit discount of 0.25%.
In addition the July 2017 offer says
For the first 59 months, your mortgage payment (instalment) will be at a fixed rate of 
1.82%, and your mortgage payment will be: £1,566.69
After 59 months assuming the interest rate, currently 4.74%, does not change, your 
new payment for 168 months will be: £1,892.74
Whereas the March 2018 offer says
For the first 51 months, your mortgage payment (instalment) will be at a fixed rate of 
1.82%, and your mortgage payment will be: £1,566.69
After 51 months assuming the interest rate, currently 4.74%, does not change, your 
new payment for 176 months will be: £1,908.53
Its clear from the mortgage offers that the same rate applied for both and that the rate 
ended on a set date  30 June 2022  rather than running for a set period (eg 60 months) 
from completion. The first offer illustrated that the fixed rate will run for 59 months, and the 
second offer illustrated the fixed rate will run for 51 months (both of those are illustrative 
based on an expected first payment the month after the offer was produced).
This mortgage was introduced by a mortgage broker, so it wasnt Skiptons responsibility to 
advise Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M about the terms of the product theyd selected. It also had 
no responsibility to inform or prompt Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M that they may want to revisit 
the product that had been selected. Skipton simply set out the terms of the contract in the 
mortgage offers and it was up to Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M whether they wanted to accept 
that. 
If Mrs M, Miss M and Mr M feel they should have been re-advised about the suitability of the 
product and/or had a new product selected when the second mortgage offer was issued in 
March 2018 then thats something theyll need to take up directly with their mortgage broker 
as the broker didnt apply for a new product despite Miss Ms recent email saying they did.
Some lenders offer their fixed rates for a set time period (such as 60 monthly payments), 
others offer their fixed rates until a set date in time (such as until 30 June 2022). Neither is 
right or wrong, and both are completely acceptable ways to set up a fixed rate, provided the 
documentation sets out the details clearly. Its clear from the mortgage offers in this case 
that the fixed rate would end on a set date regardless of when it started and Mrs M, Miss M 
and Mr M accepted the second offer and completed the mortgage on that basis.
Skipton did everything it was required to do and set the terms of the contract out in a way 
thats prescribed by the regulator. For all the reasons given Ive got no reasonable grounds 
to uphold this complaint.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. My final decision concludes this services consideration of the 
complaint, which means well not be engaging in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M, Miss M and 
Mr M to accept or reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
