K821x#15complaint
The estate  of Mr A has complained The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc wont  refund 
transactions he didnt  authorise.  
The estate  has also complained the bank  failed to verify the ID checks necessary to allow  
these transactions.
background
The estate  of Mr A comprises his wife, Ms B, their son, Mr K, and their daughter Ms M. They 
dont live in the UK. A grant of probate was obtained in the UK on 24 January  2013 to show  
they are Mr As executors. This grant  of probate was primarily obtained to assist  in another  
dispute pursued by the estate. They are represented in their complaint by solicitors  but for 
ease throughout  this decision  I will refer to the estate as the complainant.
Mr A died in December 2004. He was back with his family at the time. Mr A had lived in the 
UK and held two accounts with RBS. One of which, a notice account ending  in 7049,  is the 
subject of this complaint.  At the time of his death Mr A also held a majority  share  in a limited 
company, D.  
Any issues  arising  from D and what may have been  owed to Mr A after he died, and the 
current ownership of this company, are not the subject of this complaint.
RBS was only notified in October  2010 that Mr A had died. At the time they shared 
information with the solicitors  (who were then involved but arent now) about the balances  on 
Mr As two accounts. In 2016 after a subject access request,  the estate obtained statements 
from Mr As account ending 7049.  At that stage they complained thered been withdrawals 
made in 2005  and 2006 (four in total)  which they expected RBS to refund. 
An appendix  to this decision shows the transactions disputed by the estate. This matches 
correspondence from the estates solicitors on 14 May 2018  confirming the disputed  
transactions. The disputed transactions total £66,152.50, including fees and forfeited 
interest.
At the time RBS felt they were not required to investigate the complaint as it was brought  too 
late for them to consider.  Ms B disagreed  and brought the estates complaint to the 
ombudsman service.
Our adjudicator discussed the complaint with RBS.  He explained that he believed the estate 
only became reasonably  aware they could complain after seeing Mr As bank statements. He 
felt therefore the complaint was brought within the timescale allowed by the rules  covering 
this services jurisdiction. RBS agreed with this. RBS then also provided the sparse  
information they held about the disputed transactions. This included how these were most 
likely conducted.
After considering the evidence, our adjudicator could see whoever  had made the majority of 
the transactions had had sufficient ID to pass any checks  as Mr A. These withdrawals,  
however, had only been possible as credits had been made  to the account  in 2005 and 
2006. As he had no evidence  that the estate had any right to the funds  all paid in after 
Mr As death   he didnt  uphold  the complaint.
Ref: DRN76933462The estate  didnt agree  with this outcome and asked an ombudsman to consider its 
complaint.  
An investigator has subsequently been  in touch with the estate to confirm  that we need to be 
able to demonstrate whether the estate has suffered a loss from this account.
In the intervening period,  the estate has provided us with additional evidence to assist  in 
determining the outcome  and on request. This has included:
A transfer of property  from Mr A to D in October  2004;
Evidence they believe shows someone was impersonating Mr A at least  four years 
after he died;
Information about the credit Mr A had in his account in 2002;
Confirmation that Mr As home  address was also the registered address of D;
Information about court proceedings in another country which  confirmed the estate 
had rights to Mr As company holdings;
Information about who had  the estate felt  most likely carried out the fraud, and 
who also lived at the address RBS had on file for Mr A;
A denial that the estate has ever benefitted from any sale of Mr As holdings  in D; 
and
A copy of a 2019 Supreme Court  judgement about the Quincecare duty banks have  
to their customers.
I completed a provisional decision on 17 September 2020. I didnt  think there was enough 
evidence to show the deposits  made to Mr As account were  money  that belonged to him. So 
even though the withdrawals had not been authorised, it wouldnt be fair or reasonable to 
ask RBS to refund money to the estate.
I did ask RBS to refund  money that was withdrawn and reduced the value in Mr As notice 
account. 
The estate  didnt agree  with this outcome. Through  their solicitors they stated the heart of 
their complaint was that RBS had failed  to verify the ID when allowing withdrawals to be 
made from the account. They  included a copy of Mr As ID to demonstrate RBS couldnt 
have considered authentic ID when the withdrawals  were made. Therefore the estate was 
entitled to the withdrawn  funds. They also drew my attention to evidence  theyd previously  
provided.
RBS didnt respond to the provisional decision.
I completed a further provisional decision on 8 February 2021. This highlighted a couple of 
detailed changes in the outcome but mostly  repeated the arguments  used  before. As these 
changes were small I believed a further fortnight  was right to allow both parties  to note 
these. I didnt expect  these to have any impact  on Mr As estate and RBSs overall views.
I received nothing further from either  party. I now have all I need to complete a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN76933463Having done so, Ive not seen any evidence which has persuaded me to change the 
outcome I reached. Ill explain why below confirming the arguments  Ive made before.
This complaint is complex and has a number  of different strands. Ive therefore added  a 
summary to the end confirming my findings.
Im not going  to cover all the points raised by the estate. No discourtesy is intended by this. 
Instead, Ive focussed  on what I think are the key issues  here. This simply reflects the 
informal nature of our service as a free alternative to the courts.  I am, however, satisfied Ive 
considered all the issues referred  to me.
Where there is a dispute about what happened, I have based my decision on the balance  of 
probabilities. In other words, on what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of 
the evidence.  
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance  and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
The disputed withdrawals  in this complaint took place in May 2005 and April and July 2006.  
Mr A, the account-holder, died in December 2004.
Nowadays we would  say the relevant law is the Payment Services Regulations. These  by 
and large require banks to refund customers if they didnt make or authorise  payments 
themselves. These Regulations came into force in 2009 so they do not apply to the 
transactions disputed  here.
I have considered the common  law principles which govern  a banks mandate. Certainly the 
concept of a customer authorising a transaction, and the bank  being  required to act upon  
that instruction,  is key to how banks operate transactions on behalf  of their customers. 
These principles are present in individuals terms and conditions but also enshrined in the 
Code of Banking Practice which applied at the time. 
Ive also taken into account what the estates  representative has said around  the ID checks 
required by RBS. Banks are able to set their own requirements around  when and what  type 
of ID they require to verify transactions. I should also stress that these transactions  took 
place a while ago: in 2005 and 2006.  Id have  expected RBSs  requirements to evolve 
considerably in the last 15 years. However Ive seen no evidence to show they didnt meet  
what requirements they had set during  this time period.
The law recognises that a bank may be liable to its customer if it makes  a payment in 
circumstances where  it has reasonable grounds  (although not necessarily proof)  for 
believing that the payment instruction was an attempt to misappropriate  the funds  of its 
customer (known as the Quincecare duty). The estates  representative  has raised the 
Quincecare duty in their submissions. I recognise that.
RBS were not aware Mr A had died until 2010.  Nobody has suggested they should have 
known or were notified about this earlier. The account the transactions  were made to and 
from was a savings  account which required 90 days notice for withdrawals  with a bonus 
payable. The most recent  statements show the account remains open. This is an issue  for 
the estate and RBS to resolve. I wont be considering that aspect.
Ref: DRN76933464Ive also been  able to see from the estates evidence that they seem  to be aware  of who is 
most likely to have made these transactions. I also believe  based on what the estate  has 
stated  that this is tied up with the ownership  of D. I have no jurisdiction to query  any 
accounts held in Ds name.
There is certainly no dispute that Mr A didnt make these transactions  as the first withdrawal 
 a bankers draft for £6,500  took place  on 19 May 2005.  This transaction  was only able to 
be made because  five payments had been credited  to the account  from 31 March  to 10 May 
for a total of nearly  £6,525. These credits happened  three months and more after Mr A died. 
Only slightly more than £108 was in the account following the annual bonus  and interest  
payments made on 31 March 2005.  So the bankers  draft couldnt  have been made  at all 
without the credits to the account.
Mr A didnt make the credits to the account.  The estate has also not shown that those credits 
were money due to Mr A. 
RBS has been  able to provide some rudimentary information about how these credits were  
made. Mr As own paying-in  book  was used and these were  completed at Mr As own 
branch. I dont think theres anything that would  suggest these were  out of the ordinary  or 
would cause RBS to note these. Particularly as all parties accept RBS were  not aware  Mr A 
had died at this point.
There were further credits made in December 2005. These were international credits  but due 
to the passage of time its proven impossible to find out any further information about where 
these credits came from. All of these transactions happened 15 years  ago so its not at all 
surprising RBSs information is limited. I wouldnt have expected  them to be able to provide 
any other information based on the time thats passed. These credits allowed three 
withdrawals made in April and July 2006.  RBSs evidence suggests  that two withdrawals 
were transfers to a person living at the property Mr A transferred to D in 2004.
Having reviewed the evidence and considered what may have happened I can see no 
transactions  either crediting or debiting  the account  happened between Mr As death in 
late-2004 and 31 March 2005.  
Overall I have seen no evidence that the payments made into Mr As account in 2005 and 
2006 were meant for him, and therefore should be passed to his estate.  Nor do I believe 
RBS acted inappropriately by not identifying  the transactions that took place after Mr As 
death. 
Ive also considered whether Mr A authorised these transactions. I appreciate he wasnt alive 
at the time. There is no way I can know what arrangements he came  to with the people  he 
shared a property  with for what would happen to his accounts and personal details after he 
returned to his family overseas. Mr A had left paying-in books  and other details of his 
personal accounts as these were used for the disputed credits  and withdrawals. Ive 
considered whether this could have been deliberate on Mr As part. However  even if Mr A 
had previously allowed  someone else to use his account, once he died any agency 
arrangements would normally come to an end.
I dont believe Mr A authorised the transactions. On balance I consider that if he had allowed  
someone else to use his account, any transactions  would all have happened closer  to his 
death rather than still taking place more than 18 months later.  In any event even though 
Mr A didnt authorise the withdrawals, I still have no evidence to show  the credits were  
Ref: DRN76933465authorised by him or meant for him either, as highlighted  above.  It was those credits which 
allowed the withdrawals  to happen at all. 
There had been  £108.83 in Mr As account on 31 March 2005  before any credits were  made 
from that date onwards,  and then subsequent withdrawals. On 10 July 2006  after the last 
disputed debit  there  was only £27.64 left in the account. Although  Mr As estate didnt 
dispute the calculations made in my first provisional  decision, I subsequently updated these.  
I noted a cheque was also paid into the account  on 31 March  2005 for £123.13 which  Id not 
taken into account  in previous calculations.
On balance I think its fair and reasonable for RBS to refund to the estate the money that 
was in the account on 31 March 2005  and used  to supplement the money available  for the 
disputed withdrawals. RBS will need  to refund £81.19 and add the relevant interest 
applicable to the account for the period after that to date.
The passage of time since the disputed  transactions has made it difficult  to find out exactly 
what happened in 2005 and 2006.  Knowing Mr A died in 2004, I believe Mr A didnt 
authorise the disputed withdrawals. However those transactions  as the withdrawals came 
from a savings account  couldnt be made  without the credits made to the account in 2005 
and 2006 (also after Mr As death). I have seen  no evidence  the money paid into the account 
belonged to Mr A. Therefore I believe it wouldnt be fair and reasonable to ask RBS to refund  
money which I dont believe was Mr As even  though  he didnt authorise the withdrawals. 
The money  that was Mr As and impacted by these withdrawals  I have asked RBS to 
refund.
Mr As estate  has concentrated on the ID RBS considered  when making the withdrawals. I 
dont know  again because of the time that has passed  exactly what  ID checks were 
carried out. However, as confirmed above,  Im satisfied with RBSs submissions that they 
carried out the appropriate checks for the withdrawals that were made.
summary
Since Mr A was deceased  he could not have  authorised the transactions   whether 
or not the bank knew that and whether  or not someone who previously may have had 
authority made the transactions.
The payments  were not authorised  nor made  in accordance with the mandate so the 
usual position  is that the bank  would be required to refund  the unauthorised 
payments.
I have considered whether the bank  should  be required to refund in this case as the 
disputed payments were not authorised.
In this case the money  withdrawn was also paid into the account after Mr As death. 
Clearly this was not done by him either.
I believe the disputed  transactions  form part of a much larger dispute between the 
estate and a third party who they believe defrauded the estate and Mr A by taking his 
share of D.
Its possible that the money paid in may have come from the company, but Im afraid 
that is ultimately speculation, given the little evidence  available. All of this took place 
some time ago.
I dont dispute  its likely someone  assumed Mr As identity and was paying money in 
and withdrawing  money out after his death. However, as confirmed above, nothing 
Ive seen shows the money belongs to or is due to the estate. 
Ref: DRN76933466Therefore, whilst the bank shouldnt have  allowed the withdrawals, I cant conclude  
that the money taken was Mr As.
On this basis it would not be fair and reasonable to ask RBS to refund unauthorised 
payments.
I am instructing RBS to restore the account  to the position it was when Mr A died and 
after initial interest payments were  credited  on 31 March  2005. This means the 
money in the account will be replenished to reflect what  shouldnt have been paid out 
of Mr As own funds. Ive also asked for interest to be added.
To the extent that the estates representatives would like to recover money relating to the 
property and company  dispute involving D, then thats better  dealt with by a court. It involves 
third parties and I dont  have jurisdiction to consider those aspects. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  The Royal  Bank of Scotland  Plc to:
Refund £81.19 to Mr As estate for the money  that was in Mr As account on 
31 March 2005; and
Add the relevant interest payable on this account for the period after that.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask the estate of Mr A 
to accept or reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
