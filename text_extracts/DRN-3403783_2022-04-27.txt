The complaint
Mr M complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly lent to 
him.
What happened
Mr M took four loans with 118 118 Money. From the information we hold on file, the details of 
the loans were as follows:
Loan 
number Start dateLoan 
amount (£)TermRepayment 
amount
(£) End date
1 28/04/2015 1,000 12 months 112.94 30/12/2015
2 30/12/2015 1,251.39 24 months 90.53 06/02/2016
3 16/03/2016 1,500 24 months 114.89 05/10/2016
4 01/07/2018 1,000 18 months 92.37 24/09/2019
One of our adjudicators looked and thought 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent Mr M any of 
the loans. 118 118 Money accepts that it shouldnt have lent Mr M loans 2, 3 and 4 but 
hasnt agreed with the adjudicators findings on loan 1.
As there are no continuing disputes about loans 2 - 4 and so Ive focused my decision on 
loan 1.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing without it 
significantly adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
118 118 Moneys checks show Mr M declared his monthly income as £1,600 and his 
monthly living cost as £749 and he declared only £40 for credit commitments. However, the 
results of 118 118 Moneys search into Mr Ms credit file showed that he was utilising more 
that 50% of his bank overdraft facility, he also had several unsecured loans and was due to 
repay over £800 towards unsecured loans.
On these calculations it should have been clear to 118 118 Money that Mr M didnt have the 
scope to make the £112.94 repayment for loan 1 and it shouldnt have lent to him.
Mr M was in similar circumstances at the times of loan 2, 3 and 4 where he was struggling to 
manage his money and reliant on credit. The subsequent loans shouldnt have been lent 
either. 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
Putting things right
To put things right for Mr M, 118 118 Money should:
refund all the interest and charges applied on loans 1- 4
add interest at 8% simple per year on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement*.
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to these 
loans.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 Money 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited to put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2022.
