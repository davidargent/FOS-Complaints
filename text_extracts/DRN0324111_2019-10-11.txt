Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 11 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr N could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN03241112the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
There were two significant breaks in Mr Ns borrowing from Sunny. There  was a gap of over 
five months between loans 3 and 4. And a gap of over six months  between  loans 6 and 7. I 
think it would  have  been reasonable for Sunny  to view those gaps as an indication that 
Mr Ns finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances that had caused him to take 
out his previous loans. So I will look at Mr Ns borrowing in three separate  lending chains.
The first chain was made up of loans 1 to 3, and the second loans 4 to 6. I agree with the 
adjudicator, and for the same  reasons,  that there was nothing to indicate  Sunny needed to 
do more when it approved loans 1 to 6. So I dont think Sunny was wrong  to give loans 1 to 6 
to Mr N.
Similarly in the third chain, I think Sunny carried out proportionate checks for the first four 
loans (loans 7 to 10) and there  was nothing in the information that I think should have led it 
to reach  a different lending decision. However by loan 11 I think there were clear  signs that 
Mr N was struggling to manage his money. I say this because the credit bureau data showed 
Sunny that in just the seven days between Mr N applying for loan 10 and loan 11 the total 
debt he owed had doubled to over £16,000.  This should have prompted Sunny to carry out a 
fuller financial  review,  and I think it would most likely  have made a different lending  decision 
had it done so. So I dont think Sunny should have  given  loan 11 to Mr N.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN03241113Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ns case, I think  that this point was reached at loan 
12. I say this because:
When Mr N took out loan 12, the previous loan was still open.  And the amount Mr N 
asked to borrow for loan 12 was higher  than the previous four loans, and three times 
the value of this open  loan. At this point Sunny ought to have known  that Mr N was 
not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in their income but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
The credit  bureau  data it obtained for loan 12 showed no reduction in the rapidly 
increased debt of £16,000 previously referred to. I think  this should have made 
Sunny aware  that Mr Ns indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
The loans were  instalment loans, each  with six month terms. But Mr N frequently 
repaid his loan in the same month that hed taken it out. This isnt how instalment 
loans should usually work.  I think  this pattern of lending should also have alerted 
Sunny to the likelihood  that Mr N was having  problems  managing  his money. I think 
that Sunny shouldve  been concerned that Mr N might be borrowing elsewhere  to 
repay loans, again increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
Mr N wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. When Mr N 
applied for loan 12 he had taken out six loans in just over 3 months (considering 
solely lending chain  3), and loan 12 wasnt for a significantly  lower  amount than the 
first. Mr N had paid high interest charges to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr N lost out because Sunny provided  loan 12 because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
giving  this loan was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ns ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
I have carefully considered Sunnys  response  to our adjudicators view. In summary, it 
explained the checks it had carried out on eligibility,  affordability and credit worthiness 
setting out why it felt the loans were affordable. It also highlighted that Mr N repaid a number 
of his loans early, arguing that this shows he wasnt experiencing financial difficulties. But 
these points dont  change my conclusion. 
As Ive set out above, I think there was information  in its creditworthiness checks that 
indicated Mr N was having  problems managing his money and so Sunny should have 
considered that the loans might not be sustainably affordable. The point about Mr Ns 
repayment behaviour also doesnt  alter my findings. It might, in different circumstances, be 
reasonable to conclude  that the early repayment of a loan indicates  an improvement in 
financial circumstances. But I disagree  that was the case here, as shown by the evidence  
Sunny had of Mr Ns significant increase  in total indebtedness. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 11 and 12, and Sunny should  put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Ref: DRN03241114refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 11 and 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 11 from Mr Ns credit file
any information recorded about  loan 12 is adverse, so the entry  about  loan 12 should 
be removed from Mr Ns credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr N a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ns complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr N compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
