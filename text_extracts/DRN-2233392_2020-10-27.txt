The complaint
Mr P says PDL Finance Limited  trading as Mr Lender - irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about seven instalment loans Mr Lender provided to Mr P between April 
2014 and August 2018. A summary of Mr Ps borrowing history is below: 
 
One of our adjudicators reviewed the complaint and thought that the loans from loan 4 
should not have been given to Mr P as the repayment cost for this loan was a significant 
portion of his income. Mr Lender didnt respond to the assessment.  
As an informal resolution couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.

7 31/08/2018 31/10/2018 12 £1,200.00 £263.35But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. Having done this, Im upholding the complaint. 
Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint about loans 1 and 3. Mr P didnt respond to 
the opinion. As there appears to be no dispute about these loans, I wont be making any 
further findings on them. 
Mr Lender says it carried out adequate checks on Mr P when he applied for loan 4. This 
included verifying his employment and income. It also says it carried out credit checks 
which didnt reveal anything of concern. However, I think if Mr Lender had properly 
considered the information it had about Mr Ps financial situation and the lending, I think it 
would have seen that Mr P was not able to take on this borrowing. 
I say this because Mr P was borrowing £500, which was due to be repaid in three 
instalments plus interest. This meant that Mr P would be repaying around £340 from his 
monthly declared income of £1,100. The repayment represented a significant proportion of 
Mr Ps income and I think Mr Lender ought to have realised this and the potential for Mr P 
to struggle to make the repayment  especially as it needed to be repaid over a few 
months. As Mr P returned to borrow again a week later, for a larger amount and spread 
over a longer period, I think this shows that Mr P was unable to sustainably make the 
repayments and this loan, and all subsequent loans, shouldnt have been given.  So, Im upholding Mr Ps complaint from loan 4 onwards.  
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on loan 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 7 from Mr Ps credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give 
Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Ps complaint. PDL Finance Limited should put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
