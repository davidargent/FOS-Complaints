Mr L complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to him.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks and it 
thought the loans were affordable. 
Mr L referred his complaint to us. Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She didnt 
think 118 118 Money had carried out proper checks in respect of Loan 2. 
As 118 118 Money didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Ls complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr L would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr L wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Ls ability to make the repayments under the agreements. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loans wouldnt cause Mr L undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr L. Checks 
also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan applications.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Loan 1
When Mr L applied for the loan, he told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £1,400 
and his expenses (including other credit commitments) were £830. 118 118 Money said it 
carried out a credit search and verified Mr Ls income using industry standard checks. 
The credit search revealed Mr L owed a total of £2,971 over three active accounts. He was 
comfortably below the credit limits of his overdraft and credit card account. There was 
nothing very concerning revealed by the credit search. 
I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan and 
the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Ls monthly income So I dont think 118 118 Money ought to have been concerned the loan wouldnt be sustainably affordable for Mr L. It 
follows that I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr L Loan 1. 
Loan 2
When this loan was taken out, £1,630.61 was used to repay Loan 1. Mr L told 118 118 
Money his monthly income and expenses were broadly the same and the purpose of the 
remainder of the loan was home improvements or repairs.
118 118 Moneys credit search showed that Mr Ls total borrowing had increased in the eight 
months since taking out Loan 1 to £6,747 spread over five active accounts. I think 118 118 
Money should have been concerned about his need to borrow more so soon after taking out 
Loan 1. In addition his credit commitments with the Loan 2 repayments would be around a 
third of his stated monthly income. Due to these factors I think 118 118 Money should have 
done further checks to assure itself that Mr L would be able to repay the loan in a 
sustainable way over the 24 month term. I think it ought to have carried out a more thorough 
review of Mr Ls finances. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the checks 
carried out before providing Mr L with this loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Ive looked at Mr Ls bank statements from around the time he applied for this loan. Im not 
suggesting here that these are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily have 
done. But I think looking at these would have given a good indication of the extent of Mr Ls 
financial situation at this time. These show that in the three months before he took out Loan 
2 Mr Ls average salary was much less than hed told 118 118 Money - by around £811 - 
and his credit commitments including the new loan repayment would have been over half of 
that. So I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Mr L fairly when it agreed to make Loan 2 
as it was unlikely that he was going to be able to repay this loan without resorting to further 
borrowing.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
If 118 118 Money has sold Loan 2, it should buy this loan back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If 118 118 Money is not able to buy the loan back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
As I have concluded 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Loan 2, it should:
  refund all interest, fees and charges applied to that loan;
treat any payments made by Mr L as payments towards the capital amount of £2,630.61;
If Mr L has paid more than the capital, then any overpayments should be refunded to him 
with 8%* simple interest from the date they were paid to the date of settlement;
But if theres still an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money should come to a reasonable 
repayment plan with Mr L; and
remove any negative information about Loan 2 from Mr Ls credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ls complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Mr L as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2022.
