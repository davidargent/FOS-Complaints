K821x#15Complaint
Mr B has complained about the loans he took out through Elevate Credit  International 
Limited trading  as Sunny.  He says Sunny lent to him irresponsibly and didnt undertake 
affordability checks.
Background
Mr B took out eight  loans between 14 November 2015 and 12 August 2016. A summary of 
Mr Bs borrowing, based  on the information  provided to us from Sunny, can be found below:

Our adjudicator thought Sunny had treated Mr B unfairly by providing  loans  6 to 8. He 
thought by loan 6 a pattern of lending had developed and so Sunny was wrong to have
provided these loans.
As part of his findings, our adjudicator explained  that the picture of Mr Bs overall borrowing 
and the frequency of it indicated there may have been an underlying problem and that Mr B 
may have  been  using  the loans as part of wider financial  issues.
Mr B didnt tell us whether he agreed  or disagreed with the adjudicators view.
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  findings. It asked our adjudicator to consider that all 
of the loans taken by Mr B had relatively  small repayment amounts in comparison to his 
declared income. Sunny also asked for the adjudicator to take into account the nature of its 
instalment loan product which allows customers to take multiple  loans out at any one time. 
Sunny said that in light of this it didnt agree that giving  loans  6 to 8 was wrong.
As no agreement could be reached  the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN10946102Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably
conclude Mr B could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators  findings  about loans 1 to 5. Because  of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So, I wont be making a decision
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr B had with Sunny.
So, they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 8 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Instead  Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys 
lending history with Mr B, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. I think 
this point was reached  by loan 6, so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. I say that because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 to 5 of Mr B taking new loans
prior to and shortly after, he settled  previous  loans. I think  that by loan 6 Sunny
wouldve been aware there were only five clear days that Mr B wasnt indebted to 
Sunny during the seven  months.
By loan 6, there was no sustained, significant reduction in Mr Bs borrowing (with  the 
exception of loan 2, this loan was Mr Bs largest requested amount to date). The 
pattern Sunny wouldve  seen was that the loan amounts Mr B requested  over time 
didnt significant  decrease.  Based on this, Sunny ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr B was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loans were  leaving  in his finances.
Ref: DRN10946103Mr B wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed  Sunny and his indebtedness 
was being prolonged  for an extended period of time. Loan 6 was provided seven 
months after Mr Bs first loan and this period was extended even further when loan 7 
and then loan 8 was given.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny provided loans 6 to 8 and:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of
time and
The extended period of time Mr B owed  Sunny money was likely to have had
negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr B paid on loans 6 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove all entries about these  above loans from Mr Bs credit file. The period of
time Mr B owed Sunny money  means  that any information still recorded about
these loans is adverse.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before  18 January 2020.
