K822xcomplaint
Mrs M has complained that Phoenix  Life Limited  failed  to collect monthly  premiums  to her 
Guaranteed Over 50 Plan on time since August 2018. This issue was ongoing throughout 
September and October 2018,  premiums  became overdue and her policy was in danger  of 
lapsing.
She says that Phoenix was unwilling to resolve  the problems with her direct debit for this 
policy and made  no attempt to collect the premiums despite her communications  with it on 
this matter.
Phoenix did accept  that it hadnt adequately  explained to Mrs M why her direct debit failed 
and how she could  resolve the matter.  So, it offered to waive  the outstanding October 
premium. But Mrs M says shes lost trust in Phoenix  owing to previous problems shes  
experienced with this business and fears the problem will happen again. Shes requested  a 
refund of all the premiums  shes paid to the policy to-date.
background 
This complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators who initially  upheld it. He noted 
that Phoenix first wrote to Mrs M at the end of August 2018  to inform her that it had been 
unable to collect her monthly  premium  of £84.50, which was now overdue. To keep her 
policy up-to-date,  it would  attempt to collect £169 at the end of September 2018 for both the 
August and September premiums.
But the adjudicator thought that Phoenix  ought  to have explained to Mrs M why it had been 
unable to collect her premiums - her bank had rejected the request for payment because 
there were insufficient funds in her account. Mrs Ms feeling was that Phoenix had not 
requested payment.
In early October 2018, Phoenix again wrote to Mrs M to advise her that it hadnt been able to 
collect £169 by direct debit and that, as this was its second attempt that failed, it would 
suspend her direct debit mandate and not attempt to make  any further applications for 
payment from her account.  It advised Mrs M to contact  them  to agree  an alternative way of 
paying the outstanding  balance of £169. Payment needed to have been made within 75 
days of the first outstanding premium on 28 August 2018; that is, by 11 November 2018.
On 10 October 2018, Mrs M paid £168  to Phoenix by bank transfer. As such, she was one 
pound short of the two premiums due for August and September 2018. 
On 30 October 2018, Phoenix wrote to Mrs M to explain  that it had applied  her payment to 
the policy for August 2018 and held a credit of £83.50 on the policy for September 2018. To 
bring her policy up-to-date, it would therefore  need  her to pay £85.50  to meet  the one pound 
shortfall for September  2018 and the October 2018 premium.  It suggested that she could 
send it a cheque  or a bank transfer and she could complete a fresh  direct debit mandate  it 
enclosed to restart  premiums due from November 2018.
It seems  that, around 29 October 2018,  Mrs M paid £1.50 to Phoenix to meet the shortfall  in 
premium for September 2018 just before she received its letter dated 30 October  2018.
In the adjudicators view, the timing  of this correspondence at the end of October  2018  
confused Mrs M and she may not have understood  what she now needed to do. He thought 
Ref: DRN21913742this caused her unnecessary trouble and upset which could have been avoided had the 
position with her direct debits been  properly explained. He recommended that, in addition  to 
waiving the premium for October 2018, Phoenix  should pay Mrs M £100 for the worry she 
had been caused in this matter and to provide her guidance as to how she could resubmit 
her direct debit instruction.
While Phoenix agreed  to the adjudicators  recommendation,  Mrs M did not. She said that:
she wouldnt settle for £100  because this wasnt the first time issues  concerning 
premium payments had occurred;
each time she contacted Phoenix  to resolve  the issue, it ignored her;
shes been paying the premiums  through her bank and she had a previous  issue  with 
Phoenix in July 2018 when it took over the administration  of her policy.
Mrs M maintains that the policy should remain in place  and she should receive back  all the 
premiums she has paid to it to-date.
In response, the adjudicator felt that Mrs M took out her policy in April 2017 and didnt 
experience any issues  with premium collection until August 2018 due to a lack of funds  in 
her bank account. So, in his view,  this problem wasnt caused by anything that Phoenix  had 
done wrong. He did, however, agree that Phoenix hadnt adequately explained to Mrs M how 
the problem had arisen and this caused her some confusion.
He did think that Phoenix  was entitled to suspend the direct debt mandate  and stop 
attempting to collect further premiums, but it didnt explain to Mrs M why it was doing this or 
provide sufficient guidance to enable her to restart her premium payments.
Hence, he felt it was fair of Phoenix to waive the October premium  and to pay her £100 for 
the upset its lack of explanation and guidance had caused her. Also Phoenix has said that 
Mrs M would  need to complete a new direct debit form to avoid any future  issues.
But he couldnt ask Phoenix to return all the premiums she had paid to the policy to-date 
because, from April 2017 to August 2018,  there  were no problems with her direct debit and 
the policy had provided the cover she wanted. He could only suggest that Phoenix 
compensates her for the problems that arose since August 2018. 
As agreement couldnt be reached the complaint has been referred to me to be reviewed.
findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs M took out a whole life policy in April 2017 with a predecessor firm of Phoenix that 
provided life cover of £24,620 for a monthly  premium of £84.50. 
The policy appeared to be operating satisfactorily, and her monthly premiums were  collected 
by direct debit without any problem, until the premium that was due at the end of August 
2018. Phoenix has said that, when its request for payment  of the August 2018 premium was 
rejected, her bank  advised it that this was due to insufficient funds  being  in her account.
Ref: DRN21913743It is Mrs Ms responsibility, and not that of Phoenix, to ensure that her policy premiums are 
paid on time.  And, while the policy allows some latitude for missed  premium payments, if 
premiums remain outstanding for 60 or 90 days, the policy  will lapse. So, although  Phoenix  
is not even obliged to issue overdue premium reminders to policyholders,  in the interests of 
customer relations, and to avoid  policyholder  unwittingly losing valuable  life cover, it does 
remind policyholders every 30 days if premiums remain  outstanding.  I can see that Phoenix 
did write to Mrs M to that effect  on 29 August 2018  (when the August 2018 premium  couldnt 
be collected) and on 2 October 2018  (when both the August and September  2018 premiums  
remained unpaid). By then, Mrs M needed  to pay Phoenix £169 to bring premiums up-to-
date.
I can see that Mrs M did respond to the second  warning letter by arranging a bank transfer  of 
£168 to Phoenix, one pound short of the amount she owed,  on 10 October  2018.
Accordingly, Phoenix wrote to her on 30 October 2018 to explain that, of the £168 it received 
from her, it applied £84.50 to the policy for August 2018 and held the remaining £83.50 as 
credit towards to the premium due for September 2018. It suggested that, if Mrs M paid then 
paid £85.50, this would  meet the one pound shortfall in the premium  due for September  
2018 and the October  2018 premium  of £84.50, thereby bringing premium  payments to the 
policy up-to-date.
It does seem that, in the meantime, Mrs M had called Phoenix which explained to her that 
her payment  of £168 on 10 October  2018 left her one pound short of the total premiums  she 
owed for August and September 2018.  Mrs M responded by paying £1.50 to the policy which  
meant she then owed Phoenix £84.00  for the October  2018  premium.
Given the timing of this correspondence around the end of October 2018, I can understand 
why Mrs M might  have become confused by Phoenixs letter of 30 October  2018.  But I think  
the contents of that letter  reflected the true position  with Mrs Ms premium payments at that 
time.
However, Phoenix accepted that its correspondence  since August 2018 ought  to have been 
more helpful in explaining  to Mrs M why it was unable to collect  the policy premiums since  
then, so that she could rectify matters with her bank. But Ive no reason to suppose  that 
Phoenix didnt  even attempt to collect her premiums at that time, as Mrs M has suggested.          
            
Accordingly, given  Phoenix isnt responsible for ensuring that Mrs Ms policy  premiums  are 
paid on time,  Im satisfied  that its offer to waive the premium  that was outstanding for 
October 2018, and its agreement to pay her £100  for the shortcomings in its correspondence  
since August 2018, is a fair and reasonable outcome  to Mrs Ms complaint in the 
circumstances. 
I cant agree  that the issues raised  by Mrs M merit a refund of all the premiums she has paid 
to the policy  since  April 2017. As the adjudicator commented, there was no issue  with the 
policy until August 2018  and it would  not be appropriate to return all the premiums Mrs M 
has paid to a policy that was operating satisfactorily until then.    
And, on the assumption  that Mrs M has now completed a fresh direct  debit mandate, there is 
no reason to believe that a similar problem with premium  collection will arise  in the future  if 
she retains sufficient fund in her account.  
Ref: DRN21913744decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
I require Phoenix Life Limited  to pay Mrs M £100 for the trouble and upset she has been 
caused in this matter.  
Otherwise, as Phoenix has already paid the monthly premium  to the policy  for October 2018 
on Mrs Ms behalf, I make no further award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 October  2019.
