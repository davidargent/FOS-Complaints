K820x#14Complaint
Mr S has complained that Barclays Bank  UK Plc wont  refund payments to an online casino, 
which he says he didnt  make.
Background
Mr S has an account with an online casino. I will refer to the casino as the merchant. 
He said the merchant took payments of around £4,000 from his bank account from 
December 2013  to January 2014. He said he didnt  authorise these payments.
Below is a list of transactions he made to the merchant made during this period.

What Mr S told us
Mr S told us hed downloaded the merchants app to his mobile phone and had placed bets 
during December 2013.
He stopped playing after hed won £1,146. He withdrew his winnings on 3 January 2014 and 
logged out of the app. He said he returned his phone  to his pocket. The disputed payments 
were made after hed logged off.  
He told us hed had friends over at the time,  but none of them  wouldve used his phone to 
place the bets.  
He also said he hadnt revealed his username or password  for his account with the merchant 
to anyone else and he didnt keep a written  record of it. He said his mobile phone was 
password protected with a four-digit  code. He hadnt  shared his password with anyone else 
but someone known  to him might  know  it, as hed had the same password  for around two 
years.
Ref: DRN34772612He said he didnt make  the disputed payments to the merchant. He asked Barclays for a 
refund.
Barclays response
Initially, Barclays couldnt find the transactions to the merchant. This was because the 
merchant used a payment  platform, Aquapay. It advised Mr S to contact the merchant  
directly, which  he did but without success.  After three years, Mr S contacted  Barclays  again. 
However, Barclays didnt  investigate his fraud complaint because of a mix up with another  
merchant. It did pay him £115.00 compensation for his travel  and call costs.
Mr S wasnt  happy with this outcome and so he brought  his complaint to this service.
Eventually, this service  identified that the disputed payments had been  made  to Aquapay.  
After further investigations, Barclays decided not to refund Mr S.
It believes he authorised  the transactions. It says the merchants evidence  shows  that:
the bets were  placed from his account  with the merchant
his log in details  were used to access the account
the log in was from the same IP address  as the one used for genuine transactions
the CVV number from his debit card had been  entered 
the merchant  paid winnings into his bank account.
Adjudicators view
An adjudicator looked into his complaint and decided not to uphold it. She concluded that, 
hed authorised the payments and Barclays was entitled to hold him liable for them.  Her 
reasons are set out in her lengthy view, which both Mr S and Barclays  have seen so I wont  
repeat them  here. 
She also considered  that the compensation payment  was reasonable in the circumstances.
Mr S disagreed with the adjudicators view. Hes asked  for an ombudsmans  final decision.

My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold the complaint, for broadly the same reasons as those given by the adjudicator.
In short,  Barclays is required to refund the amount of an unauthorised transaction.  The 
relevant regulations, to this effect, are the Payment Services  Regulations  2009  (the PSRs  
Ref: DRN347726132009). Mr S says he didnt  make the disputed payments to the merchant and he wants 
Barclays to refund him. So, my primary concern is to come to a view about whether or not I 
think he authorised  the payments. 
The merchants reports show that the transactions were made  from Mr Ss mobile phone and 
with his debit card. The merchant has also sent us its instructions for making a deposit in the 
account. These confirm  that the CVV number must be entered for each deposit,  (thats  the 
three-digit number  on the back of a debit or credit card). Based  on this evidence,  Im 
satisfied that the disputed  transactions were authenticated.
So now,  I need to think about whether its more likely than not that Mr S authorised the 
disputed transactions.
Mr S admits  he has an account with the merchant and that he has the mobile app on his 
phone. The notes from the merchant  say he registered with it on 26 December 2013. Hed 
also registered his debit card with the account.
The audit trail shows he used his card to make deposits into his account with the merchant 
from his bank account. The deposits  are shown in the table above. Mr S doesnt dispute the 
payments he made from 26 to 29 December 2013. 
The audit trail also shows that hed instructed the merchant to pay the winnings back to his 
card on the following dates:
Date Time Winnings
31/12/2013 £126
31/12/2013 £400
01/1/2014 £720
02/1/2014 £2,550  
instruction cancelled on 
3/1/2014
So, its clear he had an account with the merchant, he made  deposits,  he played games and 
won and hed transferred some  of his winnings back to his bank account.
Its important I set this out because  the evidence, which  links him to the genuine payments, 
also links him to the disputed ones. And from what Ive seen, I dont think  its unreasonable  
for Barclays to conclude that Mr S authorised the transactions. This is because:
the merchants  evidence shows the same  mobile  device was used to log in to his 
account when  both the genuine  and disputed payments were made. This was an 
iPhone. Mr S confirmed hed been  using  his iPhone to place bets. I consider its more 
likely than not that his phone was used for the disputed payments
the evidence  also shows that the logins for the disputed payments were made from 
the same  IP addresses as those  used for genuine ones
the correct username  and password were  used to access  the account with the 
merchant. The merchant  confirmed it doesnt  allow auto login and these details  must  
be entered each  time a customer logs in
Ref: DRN34772614the same  game was played for all bets  European Roulette
the CVV number on the back  of Mr Ss debit card was entered  for each deposit
transfers totalling £4,500.00 were made from Mr Ss savings account to his current 
account on 3 January  2014. He used  this money to fund the bets.
I have considered whether a third party made the disputed  transactions but I dont think  this 
is what happened. A third party wouldve needed to get hold of Mr Ss phone  to make the 
bets. They would also need to know his four-digit code for his phone,  his username and 
password for the account with the merchant and the CVV number on his debit card.  Mr S 
told us that he hadnt  shared this information with anyone else,  although he thought  
someone close to him might know his phone password. However, he hadnt  reported  his 
phone as missing  and even if someone had taken it, there is still no explanation for how a 
third party would know his account details. Also, he hadnt reported his debit card as 
missing.
Similarly, its unclear how a third party would  benefit from placing bets on his account as the 
merchant paid winnings  into his bank account. I understand there are some online casino 
games, which may be exploited by fraudsters to gain access  to other  players funds, but 
European Roulette isnt one of them.
For these reasons, I think its unlikely that a third party  made the disputed payments. And the 
evidence of the transfers from Mr Ss savings account into his current  account demonstrates  
its more likely he authorised the payments.
The only other explanation  and one that Mr S originally suggested  is that the merchant 
either made a mistake or acted fraudulently.  However,  I cant  see any evidence of error or 
fraud by the merchant.  
On balance, and after considering everything, I find that Mr S authorised the disputed 
payments and that Barclays is entitled  to hold him liable for them. I wont be asking  it to 
refund him. And I agree with the adjudicator that the compensation that hes already  
received is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Im sorry  to send disappointing  news, especially after a long wait. I am very grateful  to Mr S 
for his patience while we looked into his case.
My final decision
My final decision is that I am not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 January 2020.
