The complaint
Mr H complains that TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) included information 
on his credit file that didnt belong to him. Mr H says this led to him being declined finance.
Mr H wants TransUnion to compensate him for the trouble this has caused to him.  
What happened
Mr H discovered data about an unrelated person on his credit file. The data included 
information about the third-partys insolvency. Mr H also noted that his name on the electoral 
roll was wrong.
Mr H complained to TransUnion and it apologised. It said the mistake came about due to a 
data matching error which it had since corrected. TransUnion told Mr H that if he could send 
in details of financial loss, it would consider these.
The investigator recommended that Mr Hs complaint be upheld. He asked TransUnion to 
pay Mr H £400.
TransUnion said that it would pay Mr H £200 but that £400 was significantly more than other 
offers on similar complaints. TransUnion also said the data merge was created by a 
business I will refer to as F and that it was only acting on information it had received from 
the data supplier.
Mr H wasnt willing to accept TransUnions offer to pay him £400 so the complaint came to 
me.
My provisional findings
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 2 
November 2021. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should first say I dont intend ordering TransUnion to pay less compensation than the 
investigator recommended because its significantly more than in similar cases. We decide 
each case on its own merits and take account of the impact a mistake has had on the 
individual concerned. There are however several reasons why I dont agree with the 
recommendation to pay Mr H £400. I will try and explain why.
My starting point is to look at who made the mistake in the first place. And consider what
TransUnion did once Mr H made it aware of the problem. 
Overall, Im satisfied that the source of the error was F. It overwrote Mr Hs loan application 
data with the third-partys information and then reported this to TransUnion as an alias link. It 
was Fs responsibility to report accurate data. Although TransUnions data matching process 
didnt pick the mistake up, it did respond promptly to Mr Hs concerns and removed the data 
from his credit file. Im satisfied that TransUnion responded to the problem in the way that I 
wouldve expected it to.
Mr H has given this service evidence of credit applications being declined, including a short-
term loan application that was refused as well as a rejected letting approval. I dont want to
appear insensitive, but I cant say the refusals were solely due to the third-party insolvency
record appearing on Mr Hs credit file. For example, the letting approval report does have a
Yes for bankruptcy but also says Mr H was deemed not acceptable based on adverse
credit history. This would indicate that there is some more negative data on Mr Hs credit file
but without seeing a copy, I cant say what that would be.
Mr H brought an earlier complaint that a different credit reference agency was reporting the
same third-party insolvency data on his credit file. In that complaint, Mr H said that the short-
term lender who rejected his application in 2018 suggested he discuss the issue with a credit
reference agency that wasnt TransUnion. This would indicate that the short-term lender
didnt receive the incorrect insolvency data from TransUnion.
In the same earlier complaint, Mr H told this service that hed been in financial difficulties for
some time. This makes it likely that even without the third-party insolvency data on his credit
file, Mr H wouldve faced difficulties obtaining certain types of credit.
I agree that TransUnions data matching process let Mr H down. And that he has been
inconvenienced as a result, but I dont consider that an award of £400 is justified. Its F that
bears most of the responsibility for the original mistake and I think TransUnion dealt with the
problem reasonably. I cant find that the incorrect entry reported by TransUnion is the only
reason why Mr H was declined credit, although I accept it is likely to have affected his credit
worthiness.
Overall, I think TransUnions offer to pay £200 is a fairer reflection of the impact the mistake
has had on Mr H. I appreciate that this is likely to disappoint Mr H.
Further submissions
Mr H told us that he accepts my provisional decision and we havent received a response 
from TransUnion.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr H hasnt asked me to consider any further submissions and TransUnion hasnt 
responded, I consider it reasonable to make my final decision along the same lines as my 
provisional decision. 
Putting things right
If TransUnion International UK Limited hasnt already done so, it should pay Mr H £200 
compensation. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require TransUnion International UK Limited to take the steps outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2022.
