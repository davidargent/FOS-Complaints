The complaint
Mr B complains that Retail Money Market Ltd (RateSetter) unfairly sold his peer-to-peer
crowdfunding loans hed invested in to a third party. He also says he wasnt given sufficient
notice and so hes missed out on two months interest.
What happened
In August 2020, RateSetter announced it would be focusing on consumer finance. Following
this, RateSetter made the decision to sell loans in its property portfolio to a third party. As a
result, investors received their capital back plus accrued interest.
RateSetter contacted Mr B on 16 December 2020 to give him notice of the property portfolio
sale to a third party. RateSetter explained that Mr Bs investment in its 1 Year Market would
close on 15 January 2021.
Mr B complained to RateSetter in December 2020 as he felt it was unfair for it to sell the
loans he was invested in. He said the loans were not in default and so he lost out on the
expected interest these would have accrued. He also felt he should have received two
months notice. Mr B said he only received interest up and until 16 December 2020 and so
he should be entitled to an additional two months interest in the final payment he received.
RateSetter considered Mr Bs complaint but didnt uphold it. In summary, it said:
RateSetters investor terms explained it would manage all aspects of the loans on 
investors behalf.
Selling loans in the property portfolio meant investors received their capital back in 
full plus accrued interest during a time of an uncertain economic climate.
It notified investors as soon as the sale was finalised.
An investigator considered Mr Bs complaint and didnt think RateSetter had acted fairly. In
summary, he said that having considered the investor terms, he was satisfied RateSetter
ought to have given Mr B two months notice. He said RateSetters notification gave one
months notice and so he felt Mr B had missed out on one months interest.
Mr B didnt agree that hed been given one months notice as he said his loans were repaid
on the same day he received the notification.
RateSetter also didnt agree with the findings as it said it wasnt required to give two months
notice under the investor terms.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I wrote to both parties in March 2023 explaining that I initially thought the complaint should 
be upheld. I said that although I felt RateSetter had the power under the Investor Terms to 
make the sale of Mr Bs loans to a third party, I didnt think it had given him the correct 
amount of notice of this. 
Following responses from both parties, I reviewed everything again. I wrote to both parties in 
April 2023 recommending that RateSetter should pay Mr B further compensation. 
Following further responses from both parties, I reviewed everything again and reached a 
different outcome. I wrote to both parties in May 2023 giving the following provisional 
findings:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I remain of the opinion that RateSetter had the power to make the sale of Mr Bs loans to the
third party under the following term:
3.2. By agreeing to these Terms, youre appointing RateSetter to act as your agent
in all matters relating to the origination, negotiation, administration and management
of
your loans. This includes:
[]
negotiating and executing on your behalf any agreements relating to your 
loans;
entering into any transfer arrangements on your behalf in order to transfer the 
benefit of any loans (or part thereof) to the Provision Fund, another 
RateSetter investor, RateSetter itself or a third party; and
anything else RateSetter reasonably considers necessary to manage your 
loans, including terminating those loans.
So I'm satisfied that the sale and transfer of Mr Bs loans was a legitimate exercise of the
rights given to RateSetter by Mr B when he invested.
However, I have now changed my findings on whether the correct notice period was given to
Mr B. I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr B, but I can assure him Ive
carefully considered all of the information provided.
I agree that the term I pointed to in my previous provisional findings was incorrect. I said that
RateSetter had relied upon the following term:
"16.1 We can end our agreement with you, close or suspend your RateSetter
account and stop providing any services by giving you at least two months' notice."
However, RateSetter has clarified that the closing of the 1 Year Market was essentially
discontinuing an investment product, rather than closing his RateSetter account, and so he
could have continued to invest in other products on the platform. Therefore, I accept that this
isnt the correct term it ought to have relied on when looking at the required notice period.
Rather, the correct term was:
14.3 For all other changes, well tell you personally at least 30 days before we make
the change.
So RateSetter ought to have given Mr B 30 days notice of closing its 1 Year Market product.
Its not disputed that RateSetter gave Mr B notice of this on 16 December 2020 and as the
product was closed on 15 January 2021, Im now minded to say the appropriate amount of
notice was given in line with RateSetters terms.
I appreciate Mr Bs loans were sold on the same day he was given the notice, but as Ive
said previously, RateSetter was able to sell his loans to a third party. I understand Mr Bwould have been able to continue investing in the 1 Year Market product up until it closed on
the 15 January 2021. But as there was insufficient borrower demand in the 1 Year Market,
due to the bulk of the loans in the product being those which were sold to the third party, Mr
B was unable to reinvest before the product closed. I appreciate this would have been
frustrating for Mr B, however there was no fundamental entitlement to investment
opportunities on the platform, as such opportunities were always dependent on supply and
demand. The Investor Terms explained:
1.7 [] The fact that the platform is generally always open does not mean that youll
always be able to lend on it, as this relies on borrower demand for loans.
So I dont think the fact that Mr B was unable to reinvest in the product up until the end of the
notice period means hes been treated unfairly. I also agree that if Mr B wanted to continue
investing and earning interest then he could have chosen to invest in another product on
RateSetters platform.
Taking into account all of the above, Im minded to say RateSetter acted fair and reasonably
in all the circumstances.
I asked both parties to send me any further comments and/or information they wanted me to 
consider. RateSetter responded to say it had no further comments or submissions. Mr B 
provided further comments which Ive summarised below:
The fact that Ratesetter's investor terms have two different notice periods mean that, 
in the interest of fairness, the longer notice period should prevail.
The term giving two months notice should be relied upon as the service he was 
being provided was stopped on 16 December 2020 when his loans were sold, as this 
resulted in him being unable to invest in the 1 Year Market. 
Ratesetter is arguing that the change, under the term it is relying on, is the 1 Year 
Market closing in mid-January 2021. Mr B thinks this is incorrect as the change was 
when his loans were sold and so he should have received 30 days notice of this 
sale.
He wasnt able to invest in other products on the platform as these were very 
different from the 1 Year Market with some having exit penalties applied.
He referred to an email RateSetter sent in February 2021 which gave investors two 
months notice of the entire loan portfolio sale to a third party. 
Mr B has queried why RateSetter gave two months notice on this occasion and 
didnt cancel investors investments until the end of the notice period.
Mr B says on this occasion investors money was paid into their holding account and 
so was still being held on Ratesetters platform. This was the same for the 1 Year 
Market when his loans were sold and so it strongly implies that the two months' 
notice term should also apply to the 1 Year Market closure.
Notice periods in contracts exist to protect consumers from companies making 
sudden changes and losing out as a result of having changes forced upon them and 
he fails to see how RateSetters actions can be considered fair when it has treated 
other investors differently a couple of months later.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I still dont think this complaint should not be upheld for the reasons set out 
in my provisional decision. Mr B says that because RateSetters investor terms include two different notice periods, in 
the interest of fairness, the longer notice period should prevail. However, I dont agree. The 
investor terms gave various notice periods depending on the changes RateSetter was 
making. So the question my decision must answer is what change RateSetter was making 
and whether notice needed to be given for the change. 
As I explained in my provisional findings, RateSetter was able to sell Mr Bs loans to a third 
party under the term 3.2. I understand Mr B says this was a change which required 
RateSetter to give him 30 days notice of, however I dont think this is correct. I say this as 
no notice period is listed under the term 2.3 and so it follows that RateSetter was not 
required to him notice of his loans being sold. 
The investor terms clearly set out how RateSetter can make changes. These can be found 
under the term 14. How we can make changes. These terms state that changes can be 
made to RateSetters Going Rate, for which 14 days notice would be given, as well as 
changes being made to the investor terms or its products and services which are for 
investors benefit, for which 30 days notice would be given. The investor terms then say that 
RateSetter would give 30 days notice for any other changes. Im satisfied that the closure of 
the 1 Year Market was a change involving a product or service which RateSetter was 
providing. So RateSetter was required to give Mr B 30 days notice of this, which it did. I 
dont think the fact that his loans were sold prior to notice period ending is relevant as Ive 
explained above that no notice period was required when selling his loans. 
I understand Mr B believes he has been treated differently to other investors as some 
investors received two months notice when RateSetter sold its entire loan portfolio to a third 
party. I appreciate why Mr B feels this way, but I think there is a key distinction between 
closing the 1 Year Market and selling the entire loan portfolio. As I mentioned in my 
provisional findings, when RateSetter closed the 1 Year Market, RateSetter was not ending 
its agreement with Mr B and his account remained open with him being able to continue 
investing on the platform. Therefore, RateSetter was still in a position to provide services to 
Mr B, albeit he didnt want to invest in other products on the platform. This is why the term 
16.1. doesnt apply. However, when RateSetter sold its entire loan portfolio, it ceased 
providing services to its investors and so term 16.1. applied and it gave investors two 
months notice. 
So taking into account all of the above, I remain satisfied that RateSetter acted fair and 
reasonably in all the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2023.
