The complaint
Mr S complains that BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited wont refund to him all of the 
monthly payments that hes made for a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase 
agreement but wasnt of satisfactory quality. He also complains about the service that hes 
received. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr S under a hire purchase agreement with BMW 
Financial Services in September 2019;
he had some issues with the car so complained to the dealer but the issues 
continued so he complained to BMW Financial Services in January 2020 and said 
that he wanted to reject the car  he also instructed a solicitor and an assessor and 
made payments to them;
the car had been supplied to him by BMW Financial Services under the hire 
purchase agreement  and though hed complained about the issues with the car to 
the dealer  he didnt complain to BMW Financial Services about those issues until 
January 2020 and it had eight weeks to respond to his complaint;
BMW Financial Services accepted his rejection of the car in March 2020  less than 
eight weeks after hed complained to it  and refunded his deposit and two monthly 
payments under the agreement (it then also offered him a £100 credit which it later 
said could be used towards a meal out);
Mr S says that he should receive a refund of all of his monthly payments, 
reimbursement of the solicitor and assessors costs and that the credit should be paid 
to him;
I consider that BMW Financial Services response to his complaint has been fair and 
reasonable  it accepted his rejection of the car, refunded his deposit and two 
monthly payments and offered him a £100 credit;
Mr S had used the car to drive 4,460 miles before it was rejected and I consider that 
its fair and reasonable for BMW Financial Services to keep the other two monthly 
payments that hes made as payment for that use  I dont consider that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require it to also refund those payments to him;
I dont consider that there was any need for Mr S to have instructed a solicitor and an 
assessor in connection with his complaint to BMW Financial Services or this service 
 it was his choice to do so and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable 
for me to require BMW Financial Services to reimburse him for the costs that he paid 
to the solicitor and the assessor;
I dont consider that the service that Mr S has received from BMW Financial Services 
has been unacceptable in any significant way  but it has offered him a £100 credit 
towards a meal out because of his experience  I dont consider that it would be fair 
or reasonable for me to require it to make that payment to him or to pay him any 
other compensation;
Mr S has complained to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association about 
these issues but it said that BMW Financial Services offer was reasonable, the 
investigator said that the resolution proposed by BMW Financial Services was both 
fair and reasonable and in line with what she would have recommended and I 
consider that its response to his complaint has been fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
BMW Financial Services to take any other action in response to Mr Ss complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2020.
