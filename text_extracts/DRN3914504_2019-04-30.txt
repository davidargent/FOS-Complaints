K820x#14complaint
Mr W says MBNA Limited mis-sold him a payment  protection insurance (PPI) policy.  
background
Mr W bought the policy  in 2002 some  time after he took out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr W disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ws case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ws complaint because:
 I think MBNA made Mr W aware  that the PPI was optional and that he chose to take it. 
Mr Ws policy was sold during a phone call with MBNA a little while after hed taken out 
his credit card. And from what we know about  MBNAs phone sales  processes at the 
time, I think its likely  that MBNA  wouldve  made  Mr W aware  that he had a choice 
about whether  or not to take out the policy.
 MBNA didnt recommend the PPI to Mr W so it didnt have to check  if it was suitable  for 
him. 
 Its possible the information MBNA gave Mr W about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
should have been.  But its unlikely Mr W would have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2019.
