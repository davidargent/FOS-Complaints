K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender)  was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
background
Mr P had five instalment  loans from Mr Lender between May 2015  and July 2017 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Max Repayment Repaid
1 23 May 2015 £100 3m 26 Aug 2015 £61.33 On time
2 4 Sep 2015 £200 4m 24 Dec 2015 £87.20 On time
3 12 Jan 2016 £400 6m 26 Jul 2016 £210.66 On time
4 22 Aug 2016 £550 5m 26 Jan 2017 £256.30 24 Nov 2016
5 2 Jul 2017 £350 6m 22 Dec 2017 £128.33 10 Jan 2018
Mr Lender says it carried out affordability  and credit checks before  approving each loan. It 
says Mr P provided information  about income  and expenditure  and repaid the first four loans  
on time or early. It adds it also asked Mr P specific questions about his financial status and 
the purpose of the lending before approving loan 5. Mr Lender says Mr P told it he was in 
financial difficulties whilst  repaying  loan 5 so it set up a repayment plan for the balance.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He was satisfied that enough 
checks were carried  out before Mr Lender approved loans  1, 2, 3 and 5, but considered  it 
should have asked Mr P if he had any other short-term loans before approving  loan 4. He 
said that, had it done  so, its likely  Mr Lender would  have  found Mr P needed  to pay £600  to 
other short-term lenders  just after loan 4 was agreed. So our adjudicator found loan 4 was 
unaffordable and recommended Mr Lender  should refund interest and charges on it (plus  8% 
statutory interest) and should remove associated negative information from his credit file.
Mr Lender responded  to say, in summary, that it asked Mr P how much he was paying  
towards other loans,  including  short-term loans, and hed said the figure was £250.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make  sure Mr P 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr P was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr P applied  for his first loan from Mr Lender, he said his income was £1,270.  As the 
largest repayment due on this loan was just over £60, I dont  think  Mr Lender was obliged  to 
do any further checks before it approved this loan.
Mr P repaid  loan 1 on time and a week later applied for a further loan. This was for £200  and 
the largest repayment was under £90. Mr P said his income remained  at £1,270,  so Im 
satisfied Mr Lender did enough checks and would have also found this loan to be affordable.

Mr Ps third loan was bigger again and he needed to make  a repayment of over £200. Due to 
this, and as hed been borrowing from Mr Lender  for seven months,  I think  a proportionate 
check should have  included asking Mr P about his expenditure. Mr Lender did this and found 
he had a disposable income  of over £800. So I cant conclude  loan 3 was unaffordable.
Loan 4
Mr P repaid  loan 3 on time, but a month later applied for his biggest loan yet. Hed now been 
borrowing from Mr Lender for well over a year and needed to make  a payment of over £250 
on loan 4. Because of this, I think a proportionate check should  have included asking Mr P 
about other short-term  loans. I cant see Mr Lender did this, so I have looked at Mr Ps bank 
statements to see what Mr Lender  is likely to have  found had it carried out such checks.
I can see from the bank  statements that, when Mr P applied  for loan 4, he was already 
committed to making payments to six other short-term loan companies. In the month 
following loan 4, Mr P needed to pay over £1,000 to these other lenders. Given  hed told Mr 
Lender his disposable income was £450, Im satisfied Mr P couldnt  afford  the repayments 
on loan 4 and its likely  Mr Lender  wouldnt have approved it had it carried out better checks.
Loan 5
Mr P applied for loan 5 seven months  after hed repaid loan 4. As there was a significant 
break in his borrowing and Mr Ps largest repayment on this loan was under £130,  I consider 
Mr Lender did enough  checks  by asking him about  income and expenditure. Mr P said his 
disposable income was £267, so Im satisfied  Mr Lender found loan 5 was affordable to him.
I acknowledge Mr Lender says it asked Mr P about his other loans when he applied  for loan 
4. I have looked at the format of the application and I can see there  is a space for Other  
Loans.  But I cant see Mr Lender  has specifically asked for information about other short-
term loans, so Im not satisfied the checks for loan 4 went far enough.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr 
Lender) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr P paid on loan 4;
Pay interest  of 8% simple a year on all refunds  from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative  information  about loan 4 from Mr Ps credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2019.
