The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) marked his credit file.
What happened
Mr Gs income was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic over a long period of time  from 
March 2020 through to early 2021. NatWest gave him support with a total of six months 
payment holiday on his loan between March 2020 and September 2020. He returned to 
employment again in 2021 but was still under some financial pressure and asked NatWest to 
refinance his loan in April 2020. The loan of £13,650 wasnt made available until late in June 
2021 due to an error by NatWest, and Mr Gs credit file was marked.
Mr G complained. He said the marks on his credit file meant he couldnt refinance the car 
finance with its existing lender (this loan was separate to NatWests loan), and he was 
threatened with its repossession. He said this was due to NatWests error.
NatWest apologised and removed the arrangement to pay markers from his credit file for 
the months of February 2021, April 2021, and May 2021. They paid compensation of £350 
and provided a letter to the car finance company to say theyd made the error.
Mr G brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest acted reasonably. He said 
theyd admitted their errors, put things right and paid an appropriate amount of 
compensation. During our investigation, NatWest agreed to pay an extra £150 for what 
happened.
Mr G didnt accept NatWests further offer and asked that an ombudsman look into his 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr G has had several complaints with NatWest through 2020 and 2021. But 
Mr G has advised us that we only need to look at what happened on his credit file in 2021  
and the effect this had on his car finance (of £7,200) with that lender. 
NatWest agreed to refinance Mr Gs NatWest loan in April 2021. Due to an error, this wasnt 
processed as was intended and the loan was drawndown on 29 June 2021. I can see that 
Mr G had to chase NatWest several times for the paperwork and to find out what was 
happening. But also  again due to an error, Mr Gs credit file was marked with adverse 
markers for the months of February 2021, April 2021, and May 2021. It isnt clear how or 
why this happened  weve asked NatWest about this and it remains unclear. But  NatWest 
admitted it was an error and put it right by removing the markers.
Mr G says this affected his car finance with a separate provider. He says he was unable to 
refinance his car loan because of the markers. We asked Mr G for evidence from his finance 
provider that their decision was due to the markers on his credit file, but unfortunately he 
couldnt provide this. Im not surprised about that  because lenders will make lending  
decisions based on a range of factors, of which a customers credit file is only one. But after 
their error, NatWest did provide a letter addressed to whom it may concern dated 29 June 
2021 to say the markers were due to their error and were about to be removed. 
I can accept this was inconvenient and stressful for Mr G. But, having looked at what 
happened, NatWest did all they could to resolve things  they removed the markers from Mr 
Gs credit file, provided a suitable letter and paid compensation of £350  which is the right 
amount we would expect to see for what happened. So  in normal circumstances I wouldnt 
recommend that NatWest need to do anymore here. But in this case, NatWest have offered 
a further £150 to settle the complaint which Mr G has declined to accept. The offer remains 
on the table - and Mr G should contact NatWest directly if he now wishes to accept this.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2022.
