K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that Gain Credit  LLC,  trading as Lending Stream,  reneged  on an offer to
accept a payment  of £147.84  in full and final settlement  of his debt.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision of
28 February 2020, an extract of which is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I 
wont repeat  that information here.  
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I didnt  think that Lending  Stream had 
offered to accept £147.84  in full and final settlement of what  Mr A owed. I said that 
Lending Streams  reference  to £147.84  was a mistake.  
I explained why I didnt intend  to direct Lending Stream  to accept £147.84  in settlement 
of what Mr A owes, nor to remove  adverse information from his credit file. I said I 
intended to direct Lending Stream to reduce  the amount Mr A owes  in relation to loan 
ending 433 by £100 to compensate him for his distress and inconvenience. I said that 
Lending Stream should also agree an affordable  repayment plan with Mr A about loan 
433, as it had already  agreed to do. 
 
responses to my provisional  decision
Mr A didnt agree with my provisional decision.  He said,  in summary:
The provisional decision didnt accurately  reflect his complaint. 
Lending Stream didnt  deal with his complaint in 2017 in a timely  way.
The main reasons for his complaint is that he neither asked for nor received loans 
that Lending Stream say it gave him on 29 December 2015  (loan  094 in my 
provisional decision) and 10 January 2016. 
He didnt know anything about  this debt until many  months  later, when he asked 
Lending Stream about his balance.
Lending Stream didnt  provide  him with copies of letters telling him that the debt had 
been passed to a third party. 
He assumed that Lending Stream had investigated his complaint in 2017 about  
neither asking for nor receiving two loans and upheld his complaint, which is why it 
said it was happy to accept a payment of £147.84 in full and final settlement of all 
debt, which he agreed to before he became ill. Lending Stream hasnt  provided  him 
with details of its internal  investigation.  
He didnt make the agreed payment of £147.84 because he became ill but contacted  
Lending Stream again when he recovered.  
Ref: DRN63120802The provisional decision doesnt mention that he complained about not receiving the 
loan. 
Lending Streams  e-mail  to him resolving  his complaint doesnt seem  to carry any 
weight and its not clear what he owes. 
Compensation of £100 in relation to his distress  and inconvenience is insufficient  and 
should be in excess  of £500.
Lending Stream said that both loans -  433 and 094 - are now with a third party,  so it will 
ask the third party to reduce the balance of 433 by £100 by way of compensation for 
distress and inconvenience, if Mr A accepts  the final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr As complaint to this service was that Lend ing Stream reneged on an offer to accept a 
payment of £147.84 in full and final settlement of his debt. Before I issued  my provisional 
decision, I asked  the adjudicator to clarify the extent  of Mr As complaint with him. Mr A said 
that he wanted us to look at the complaint as set out in the complaint form and dealt with by 
the adjudicator  in her initial assessment. So, my provisional decision deals with Mr As 
complaint about  Lending  Stream  reneging  on an offer. 
Several of Mr As comments relate  to an earlier dispute about whether he asked for or 
received two loans.  Thats  not the complaint Im dealing with here. 
Lending Streams  final response to Mr A about  his complaint that he didnt receive two loans 
was in September 2017. The time limit for referring that complaint to us was six months from 
the date of Lending Streams final response. In its final response letter, Lending Stream  said 
that it wouldnt give permission for this service to consider the complaint if it was referred  to 
us later than that. If Mr A now wishes to pursue that complaint,  he should explain why he 
couldnt refer that matter  to this service within six months of Lending Streams  final response 
in September  2017. This service can then look at that and decide  whether its something we 
can deal with under a separate  complaint.
For the reasons  I explained in my provisional decision, I think  that Lending  Stream made a 
mistake in its offer to Mr A and I dont  think its fair or reasonable to direct  it to accept 
£147.84 in settlement of what Mr A owes. 
I note what Mr A says about the level of compensation  but Im afraid I dont agree. Lending  
Streams muddled offer meant  that Mr A was disappointed to discover that the position 
wasnt as he thought. I think that a large  proportion  of the time Mr A spent dealing with 
Lending Stream related to his earlier complaint.  In all the circumstances, I think 
compensation of £100 is fair in relation  to Mr As distress and inconvenience.
Lending Stream now says that both loans  094 and 433  are with a third party.  Lending 
Stream is entitled to do that. It says it will instruct the third party to deduct £100  from Mr As 
debt in relation  to loan 433. If it doesnt  receive  confirmation from the third party  that its 
deducted £100 from loan 433, Lending  Stream must take the debt back  into its own books, 
so that it can reduce  the debt by £100. 
Ref: DRN63120803As loan 433 is currently with a third party its no longer appropriate to direct
Lending Stream to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr A but if it takes the debt back  
into its own books, it should do so. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr As complaint in 
part. I now direct Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, to reduce  the amount Mr A 
owes in relation to the loan ending 433 by £100 by way of compensation for his distress 
and inconvenience.  
If Lending Stream doesnt receive  confirmation  from the third party  that its deducted £100 
from loan 433, Lending Stream must  take the debt back into its own books, so that it can 
reduce the debt by £100 and then agree an affordable repayment  plan with Mr A about that 
loan. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 May 2020.

complaint
Mr A complains that Gain Credit  LLC,  trading as Lending Stream,  reneged  on an offer to 
accept a payment  of £147.84  in full and final settlement  of his debt.
background
In 2017, Mr A disputed that hed taken out a loan with a reference ending  094  with
Lending Stream and said that hed only taken out one loan.
In September  2017, Lending Stream offered  to waive repayment of £850.20 in relation 
to loans ending  433 and 094. Ill refer to the terms of its offer in more  detail below.
Mr A says that he accepted that offer in September 2017, but was diagnosed with a 
serious illness, which took up all of his focus  and time, so he didnt make  the required 
payment.
In early 2019, Mr A contacted Lending  Stream to explain his circumstances  and make  
payment of £147.84, which he said was the amount  previously  agreed. Lending Stream  
said that the previous offer was withdrawn.
Lending Stream said that it didnt receive Mr As acceptance of its offer in 2017 and that 
it subsequently transferred  the debt relating to the loan ending 094 to a third party.  It 
said that it would agree an affordable repayment plan for repayment  of the outstanding 
balance of £730.40 in relation to the loan ending  433.
Mr A complains that Lending Stream reneged  on its previous offer,  which he accepted  and 
didnt deal with his complaint about this matter.  He wants Lending Stream to accept 
payment of £147.84 in full and final settlement of the debt and remove  adverse  information  
from his credit record.
One of our adjudicators  assessed Mr As complaint. She said that, on balance, she was 
satisfied that Mr A accepted the offer in 2017.  So, she didnt think  it was reasonable for
Mr A to have to repay more to settle the debt. The adjudicator said that Lending  Stream 
should reinstate  its offer of £147.84.
Lending Stream didnt  agree with the adjudicators assessment. It said that that the waiver  
it offered in 2017  was a gesture of goodwill. Lending  Stream said that Mr A didnt contact it 
to accept that offer. It said that when  Mr A contacted it in January  2019,  it told him that the 
offer wasnt  available. Lending  Stream said that it offered Mr A an affordable repayment 
plan in relation  to the loan ending 433 and that it had transferred ownership of the loan 
ending 094 to a third party.
As there  was no agreement between the parties, the complaint was passed  to me, 
an ombudsman, to decide.
Ref: DRN63120805my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service cant deal with Mr As concerns about  how Lending Stream dealt with his 
complaint. The rules under which we operate dont include  powers to deal with complaint  
handling by lenders. I realise Mr A will be disappointed by this but I cant  act outside my 
legal powers.
Based on what Ive seen,  Mr A took out 12 loans with Lending Stream  between
April 2014 and December  2015. So, it isnt accurate to say that Mr A only had one loan 
with Lending Stream. The loans relevant to this complaint are loans 11 and 12. A 
summary of relevant information  about those loans  is as follows:

(sold to third 
party)
Ive looked carefully  at the offer Lending Stream made in its e-mail to Mr A of
15 September 2017. I think its muddled.  The total amount owing for the two loans was
£1,340.60 (£730.40 + £610.20). Lending Stream offered  to waive  interest and charges of
£850.20 and accept the outstanding principal of £490.40. It then referred to the 
outstanding balance of £147.84.
Its not clear to me why Lending Stream referred to £147.84. That wasnt  the 
outstanding balance due in relation to the two loans after waiving £850.20. I dont think 
that Lending  Stream  offered  to accept £147.84  in full and final settlement of what  Mr A 
owed. I think its clear  that figure conflicts with the other  figures in that e-mail. I think that 
Lending Streams  reference  to £147.84  was a mistake.
When mistakes  like this happen, we dont proceed  on the basis that the mistake  was the 
true position.  We look at the effect of the error. I dont think  that Lending Streams error 
caused Mr A any loss. Mr A is no doubt  disappointed to discover that offer wasnt as he 
thought and hes had the inconvenience of pursuing  a muddled offer. Lending  Stream is 
the expert here and wed expect it to get this right.
Mr A says that he accepted Lending Streams  offer on 16 September  2017. Theres  a
dispute about whether Lending  Stream received Mr As e-mail but I dont think  that alters 
the outcome here. Thats because I think that Mr A was trying  to accept an offer Lending 
Stream didnt make: it offered to accept £490.40 and made  a muddled reference to 
£147.84.
Ref: DRN63120806Ive considered whether it would be fair in this case to direct Lending Stream to reinstate its 
offer to accept  £490.40 in settlement of what Mr A owes in relation to both loans. I dont  
think it would. Thats because, whilst Im sorry to hear about  Mr As ill health,  I think, on 
balance, its unlikely that ill health and treatment  prevented Mr A dealing  with this matter for 
over fifteen months. A considerable period of time has passed  and events  have moved on in 
that Lending  Stream  has passed the loan ending 094 to a third party.
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr A, but for the reasons  Ive explained, I dont intend to direct 
Lending Stream to accept £147.84 in settlement of what  he owes, nor to remove  
adverse information  from his credit file.
As Lending Stream  says, its willing to agree an affordable repayment plan for the amount 
Mr A owes in relation  to loan ending 433. I think that Lending Stream should reduce the 
amount Mr A owes in relation to loan 433  by £100 by way of compensation for its 
muddled offer. The confusion that offer caused  led to Mr As distress and inconvenience in 
finding out that the offer wasnt  as he thought. Mr A was also put to the trouble of pursuing 
the muddled offer.
Mr A should contact  the third party about repaying  the loan ending  094.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I propose  to uphold Mr As complaint in part. I intend to 
direct Gain  Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, to reduce that amount Mr A owes  in 
relation to the loan ending 433 by £100 by way of compensation for his distress and 
inconvenience. It should also agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr A about loan 
433, as its already  agreed to do.
