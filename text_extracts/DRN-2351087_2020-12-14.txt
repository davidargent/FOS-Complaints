The complaint
Mr S says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LaH), irresponsibly lent to him. He 
says that LaH didnt carry out proper affordability checks, if it had then it wouldve seen the 
loans werent affordable. The loans caused him financial problems. 
What happened
This complaint is about 13 home collected loans LaH provided to Mr S between July 2016 
and November 2019. Ive included a table below that shows some of the information about 
the loans that I have been provided.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr S complaint. He thought that from loan 4 onwards Mr S was 
paying too high a proportion of his income. And from loan 6 onwards the pattern of lending 
itself was harmful. So he upheld the complaint about loans 4 to 13. 
LaH disagreed in part. It didnt think the payments at loan 4 were too high a proportion of his 
income. But it said that Mr S was in financial difficulty before loan 8 and so it offered to pay 
compensation from this point onwards. 
As no agreement has been reached so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LaH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Mr S could repay their loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. And LaH agreed that 
loans 8 to 13 shouldnt have been approved. Because of this, I dont think there is any 
ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont be making a decision about this 
lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr S had with LaH. So, they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took. And Ive 
included loans 8 to 13 in my putting things right section below for completeness. 
Our adjudicator thought that by loan 4 Mr S was paying too high a proportion of his income 
to his loans for LaH to safely say that the repayments were sustainable. I have 
independently reviewed the evidence of Mr S income and expenditure, in relation to these 
repayments and Ive come to the same conclusion.
At loan 4 Mr S was still repaying loans 2 and 3. And the amount he was due to repay was 
just over 14% of his weekly income. I think this is too much here, particularly given that Mr S 
income could reasonably describe as modest at just over £200 a week. And he was due to 
make these repayments for a significant amount of time. Mr S didnt have very much to 
spare each week before the loans  in money terms. So Im upholding his complaint about 
loans 4 and 5. 
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to loan 6 and I think the lending history and 
pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be 
unsustainable. So I think LaH was irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Ive considered all of the points LaH made in response to the adjudicators view. But these 
arent any new issues  theyre factors already taken into account in the adjudicators 
assessment, and they dont demonstrate to me that the lending from loan 4 was sustainable. 
So the points raised by LaH havent changed my decision and Im upholding this complaint.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LaH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr S from loan 4, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr S may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr S in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LaHs liability in this case for what Im satisfied 
it has done wrong and should put right.
LaH shouldnt have given Mr S loans 4 to 13. LaH has conceded in relation to Loans 8 to 13 
and I have included them all here for completeness. 
If LaH has sold the outstanding debts LaH should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If LaH is not able to buy the debts back then LaH should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) LaH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
B) LaH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr S which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LaH should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr S as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr S having made 
overpayments then LaH should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. LaH should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr S. However if there is still an outstanding balance then 
LaH should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr S. LaH shouldnt pursue 
outstanding balances made up of principal LaH has already written-off.
E) LaH should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr S credit file in relation to 
loans 4 and 5. The overall pattern of Mr S borrowing for loans 6 to 13 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr S credit file. LaH does not have to remove loan 14 from Mr S credit file until it has been 
repaid, but LaH should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LaH to deduct tax from this interest. LaH should give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax LaH has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr S complaint. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right as set out above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2021.
