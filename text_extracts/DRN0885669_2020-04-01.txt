lent to him.

This complaint is about 11 instalment loans ECI provided to Mr D between  July 2015 and 
April 2016. Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought  the loans from 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. ECI disagreed with our adjudicators view but it agreed  to uphold 
Mr Ds complaint about loans 9 to 11. So ECI made  an offer to Mr D in line with our 
approach about  loans  9 to 11. Mr D rejected ECIs offer and the complaint was passed to me 
to look at again.
None of the parties commented on loans 1 to 5 being rejected, so I dont need to look at 
those loans again. And as ECI have  agreed  to uphold loans 9 to 11, I dont  need  to look at 
those loans again. So I only need  to look at loans 6 to 8 in this decision.  Although  I will look 
at Mr Ds full lending  history with ECI to assess the case fairly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN08856692But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable  
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
I looked at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Mr D, with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which ECI should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have  realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point ECI ought to have realised Mr D was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr D had taken out 5 loans within 4 months and Mr D had been indebted 
to ECI for 5 months. So ECI ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr D 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Ds indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ds first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £300. At this point ECI ought to 
have known that Mr D was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Ref: DRN08856693From  loan 6 onwards  Mr D was sometimes provided with a new loan within 
days/weeks before settling a previous one. 
Mr D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed ECI. Loan 8 was taken  
out 8 months  after Mr Ds first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr D had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to ECI over an extended  period.
I think that Mr D lost out because ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ds ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6, 7 and 8 and ECI should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
For the sake of clarity and completeness,  Ill explain what Elevate Credit International 
Limited needs to do in respect of loans  6 to 11  so as to include the loans where  it has 
made an offer.
refund  all interest, fees and charges Mr D paid on loans 6 to 11 (inclusive);
pay 8% simple interest a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 11 (inclusive)  should  be 
removed from Mr Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Mr D a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right for Mr D as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
