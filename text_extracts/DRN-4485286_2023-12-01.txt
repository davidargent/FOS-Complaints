The complaint
Mr D complains that PayrNet Limited closed his account without giving a reason and 
returned the remaining funds to their sender.
What happened
Mr D had an account with an agent of PayrNet. To keep things simple, Ill just refer to 
PayrNet in this decision. In August 2022, PayrNet suspended Mr Ds account while it carried 
out a review. Two days later, it decided to close Mr Ds account. PayrNet says it did this 
because Mr D was using his account to facilitate transfers to other bank accounts. PayrNet 
returned some funds to Mr D. But it said it planned to return the remaining £484.44 to their 
source.
Dissatisfied, Mr D referred his complaint to us.
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 15 November 2023. I didnt think the 
complaint should be upheld.
PayrNet had asked Mr D for information about a payment out of the account. Mr D said it 
was a rent payment, and provided a copy of a rental agreement. The name of the landlord 
on that agreement didnt match the name on the account Mr D paid the money to. PayrNet 
asked Mr D about this. Mr D told PayrNet this was because hed paid the landlords agent  
who was going to pay the funds to the landlord.
But Mr D gave us a different explanation of what had happened. He says the person he tried 
to pay was a housemate he shared another property with. He sent us another tenancy 
agreement  between this housemate and another landlord. He also sent us 
correspondence showing that at the time of this payment he was behind on his rent.
Based on this, I thought Mr D had tried to mislead PayrNet about the purpose of the 
payment. I didnt think I could place much weight on what hed said happened. With this in 
mind, I didnt think PayrNet acted unfairly when it closed his account. And I thought PayrNet 
had grounds to do so immediately.
For similar reasons, I thought PayrNet could return the funds to their source. Id only expect 
PayrNet to do so if it had good reasons to suppose Mr D wasnt entitled to them  and here 
Mr D appeared to have misled PayrNet about what he was using these funds for. I said that 
if Mr D felt he was still entitled to the remaining £484.44 he should continue raising this with 
the recipient.
I said Id consider any further comments I received by 13 December. PayrNet has confirmed 
that it has received this information. 
Mr D has responded to say he disagrees with my conclusions. He denies misleading 
PayrNet. He says he presented the tenancy agreement with his name on it when requested 
to show the money was his rent money and needed it urgently for his rent. He then provided 
the other tenancy agreement to show us why he was made the payment to the other third 
party. He thinks he is still entitled to the remaining funds.
Ive therefore considered the complaint afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered the points Mr D has raised. But these dont change my conclusions. 
Ill explain why. 
Mr D suggests theres been a misunderstanding  that he provided information to PayrNet to 
show he urgently needed the funds to pay rent, and provided different information to us to 
show why hed paid the funds to the third party named on the other rent agreement.
Ive therefore considered the transcript of the conversation between PayrNets agent and 
Mr D. On 1 August, Mr D told PayrNet the payment was for rent. The next day, PayrNets 
agent asked Mr D to provide a copy of the tenancy and rental agreement. Mr D then sent 
PayrNet the tenancy agreement between himself and a landlord. PayrNet then asked Mr D 
why the name of the landlord wasnt the same as the person he was sending the money to  
and named the beneficiary. Mr D replied
Basically, I sent 1k to [third party] because his the middle agent and that how have 
been always send him the rent money so he can send it to the landlord and also 
because he already got lanlord account on his account. So its much easier. 
I recognise this will be disappointing to Mr D. But I dont accept there was any 
misunderstanding here. PayrNet asked clear questions about the payment, and Mr D replied 
that the person he was sending the funds to was the agent of the landlord named on his 
tenancy agreement. This is plainly at odds with the explanation hes subsequently provided 
to this service. Im satisfied that, for whatever reason, Mr D gave PayrNet information that 
wasnt right. PayrNet has also said it has concerns with Mr Ds use of the account. Given 
everything Mr D and PayrNet have told us, and the concerns PayrNet had, I cant say 
PayrNet acted unfairly in closing the account or returning the funds to source.
Mr D says that PayrNet returned the funds to the wrong account. He says funds in the 
account were in two parts: a state benefit payment, and money that was paid into the 
account by a friend. (Mr D says hed paid cash to the friend, who in turn transferred this 
amount to his account with PayrNet). Mr D says the funds PayrNet have already returned to 
him relate to the state benefit payment  and so that the remaining £484.44 should have 
been paid to his friend. 
I understand Mr Ds position. But in this decision, I can only consider Mr Ds complaint about 
PayrNet. Ive concluded that PayrNet didnt need to pay the remaining funds to Mr D. But Im 
not in a position to say whether the government department or Mr Ds friend is instead 
entitled to these funds  and nor can I make an award to a third party. And when money is 
paid into a payment account, its mixed together. I can only suggest that Mr D continues to 
raise this with the government department.
For all these reasons, I reach the same conclusions as my provisional decision. I dont 
uphold the complaint and Im not going to tell PayrNet Limited to do anything further.My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2023.
