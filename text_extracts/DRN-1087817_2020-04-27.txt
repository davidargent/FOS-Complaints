The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed down his current account. Mr G 
wants to know why his account has been closed.
What happened
In August 2019, Mr G says NatWest wrote to him letting him know they intended to close his 
account and gave 60 days notice. Mr G is unhappy as he believes the intention to close the 
account was because of an outstanding debt he holds with NatWest. Mr G also says 
NatWest told him that the outstanding balance on the account would be given to a debt 
recovery agency. Mr G is concerned that this is going to affect his credit file and would like to 
know why NatWest chose to close his account.
NatWest say they made a commercial decision to end the relationship with Mr G and that 
they did this in line with the accounts terms and conditions.
Our investigator looked into this complaint. He said he hadnt seen any evidence of NatWest 
doing anything wrong and so was unable to uphold the complaint. Mr G disagreed and said it 
was unfair for NatWest to intend to close his account. So the case has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold this complaint, which I know will come as a disappointment to Mr G. Ill explain why. 
I can appreciate Mr Gs concern at finding out NatWest were intending to close his account 
and the impact this may have on his credit file. On occasion, a bank will decide they no 
longer want to do business with a consumer, as NatWest did in this case. NatWest have 
sent me the terms and conditions from around the time Mr Gs account was closed and I can 
see this says the bank can close an account immediately in certain circumstances. And 
these terms and conditions also allow for the account to be closed, provided they give 60 
days notice.
Mr G has sent us a copy of the letter he received from NatWest informing him of the account 
closure in August 2019. I can see the letter explains the 60 days notice and that Mr G was 
required to pay any funds owed to the bank at the end of the 60 days. And that unless 
satisfactory repayment is received, his account may be reported to credit reference 
agencies. 
NatWest intended to close Mr Gs account within 60 days and as Ive explained, Im satisfied 
they made Mr G aware that he was required to repay any outstanding debt on the account. 
NatWest have told us that Mr Gs account remains open for now but that its non-
operational  they explained this means the account can only receive credits to repay the 
debt. Under the circumstances this seems reasonable - as NatWest are entitled to close 
down an account anyway and I dont think its unreasonable for NatWest to make the 
account non-operational apart from the recovery of a debt. I appreciate Mr G wants to know the reason why NatWest intends to close the account and I 
can understand this must be frustrating for him. NatWests terms and conditions say they 
can end a relationship as long as they give 60 days notice. It doesn't state they have to 
provide a reason.
Taking everything into account, Im satisfied NatWest have acted fairly by effectively closing 
down Mr Gs account for normal use  and gave the appropriate notice. And overall, I see no 
reason to conclude that NatWests decision to do this was unreasonable. So I wont be 
asking them to do anything differently. Mr G should get in touch with NatWest if he wishes to 
discuss matters relating to his debt further. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2020.
