The complaint
Mr H ciomplains about National Westminster Bank Plc (Natwest) sending him another 
customers personal information.
What happened
Mr H received correspondence from Natwest. Included with the correspondence was a bank 
statement for a third party giving that partys bank and personal details.
Natwest apologised for what had happened and said it would reimburse the costs incurred 
by Mr H in returning the documents.
Mr H brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator thought that Natwests actions to 
date were appropriate. Mr H didnt agree and asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont think that Natwest need do any more than it has already. I say this because:
Natwest has acknowledged, and apologised for the error which resulted in Mr H 
being sent a third partys personal information.
Natwest has asked Mr H to return the documents to it for safe disposal, and said it 
will reimburse costs incurred by Mr H when he does this.
While I agree it would have been concerning to receive this information, Natwest has 
taken action to resolve the matter. Theres no evidence, or suggestion, that Mr Hs 
information has been similarly shared with third parties in error. 
I dont think the amount of inconvenience caused to Mr H is sufficient as to require 
Natwest to pay compensation. The inconvenience is limited to his contacting Natwest 
and returning the documents (for which its already agreed to reimburse him).
My final decision
Its my final decision not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2021.
