K820x#14complaint
Mr G says AvantCredit of UK, LLC (AvantCredit)  acted unfairly when it lent him money in 
2015.
background
In September  2015, AvantCredit  lent Mr G £2,000, which Mr G agreed to repay,  with 
interest, over 35 months. The monthly  instalment was £116.95, so if Mr G made  all the 
payments on time hed pay £4,210.37  in total.  But Mr G immediately  started missing  
payments. He paid £65 towards the loan in total,  and in July 2017,  the debt was sold to a 
third party.
Mr G thinks AvantCredit was irresponsible  by lending him the money. 
AvantCredit looked at Mr Gs complaint and thought it should be upheld. It agreed  to remove 
all interest and charges  from the account. It says this means  hed have owed £1,935.
Our investigator looked at the complaint and thought  that AvantCredits offer was fair, 
bearing in mind the difficult financial circumstances Mr G now found  himself in.
Mr G doesnt agree.  He says the business  the debt was sold to was only seeking  repayment 
of £2,000, so he doesnt  think  that what AvantCredit has offered him helps him. He also 
wants compensation for the mistakes  he says AvantCredit made together  with the stress he 
says hes been  put through.
As the investigator  couldnt resolve matters informally, the complaint has been  referred  to 
me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As AvantCredit has agreed that Mr Gs complaint about the lending should be upheld, in this 
decision Ive looked  at whether what AvantCredit has offered is fair.
I think it is. Ill explain why.
AvantCredit shouldnt  have lent Mr G the money. Hes had the money, and spent it, so I think  
its fair that Mr G should repay the amount  he borrowed. But hes also incurred interest  and 
charges  and I dont  think  it would be fair to make him repay that.
Ive looked at what AvantCredit has done.  AvantCredit has arranged  with the third party that 
now owns the debt to remove all interest,  fees and charges from the outstanding balance of 
the loan. It has then treated the payments Mr G made as if they were  repayments of the 
amount Mr G borrowed. Mr G borrowed £2,000, and AvantCredits records show  he paid £65 
towards the loan in total. This means  he would have owed £1,935  when AvantCredit sold the 
debt to the third party. Ive seen notes showing that AvantCredit has now told the third party  
the updated balance. 
Ref: DRN69188942Im satisfied that this means Mr G now only has to repay the cash  amount he originally  
borrowed.
Ive considered the other points Mr G has raised. He says the third party  the debt was sold 
on to was only pursuing him for £2,000. So he doesnt feel that what AvantCredit has done 
has really helped him personally.  I can certainly see why Mr G feels this way. But Im 
satisfied that AvantCredit  has arranged to remove the interest and charges from the debt it 
sold on. I dont  think the decision of the third party to pursue him for only part of the original 
debt makes a difference what its fair to tell AvantCredit to do for irresponsibly lending Mr G 
the money.
Mr G has also mentioned  his gambling problems and his history of short  term lending  and 
defaulted accounts. I have great deal of sympathy  for Mr G and agree he has had a very 
difficult time and Ive taken these  into account  in reaching my decision. But Avant  Credit  has 
already accepted that it shouldnt have provided this loan to Mr G  presumably as it accepts 
that proportionate checks would have  highlighted some of the issues  raised.  And,  as Ive 
explained, what AvantCredit has offered to do is what Id have told it to do if Id decided the 
complaint should  be upheld  for those reasons.
Ive also thought about whether AvantCredit did anything else that was unfair.  Mr G says 
AvantCredit didnt  write  to him to say it had sold on the debt. Ive thought  about this. I see 
from AvantCredits records that the debt was sold to the third party in July 2017. Mr G says 
hed changed  address  by then. But I havent seen  anything to show  Mr G notified 
AvantCredit that hed changed  address,  and in any case AvantCredits notes also suggest 
that the notice  was sent to Mr G by email,  and so I think its likely hed have got this. 
Finally, in this decision  Ive just looked at what AvantCredit has done. If Mr G is unhappy  
with what happened  to the debt after it was sold to the third party, he needs to raise this with 
the third party.
my final decision
AvantCredit of UK LLC has offered fair compensation for irresponsible  lending. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject by decision by 16 April 2020.
