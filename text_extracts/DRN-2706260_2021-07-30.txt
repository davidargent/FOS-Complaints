DRN-2706260
The complaint
Mr D has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) suspended his account 
and removed his ability to file Purchase Protection cases.
Background
Mr D used his account with PayPal to make purchases securely and with the knowledge that 
he benefited from PayPal Purchase Protection is there was something wrong with a 
purchase.
On 2 July 2020 PayPal suspended Mr Ds account and removed the Purchase Protection 
facility  meaning that any ongoing cases were declined also.  It sent an email message to 
Mr D confirming the account could no longer be used to send or receive funds because he 
had continually filed cases that do not align with the intent of the PayPal Purchase 
Protection Program and are contrary to the terms outlined in our User Agreement.
Mr D complained to Paypal, but it maintained the same position in relation to his account, 
and so the complaint was referred to this Service.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ds complaint and requested further information from 
both parties.  She noted that PayPals terms allowed it to suspend, block, limit or close an 
account if it believes a customer has engaged in what it calls restricted activity which 
includes Abuse (as either a buyer or seller) of [its] online dispute resolution process and/or 
PayPal Buyer Protection.
The investigator concluded PayPal had acted fairly and said that Mr Ds complaint should 
not be upheld.
Mr D disagreed. As no agreement could be reached, it was requested that the complaint be 
referred to an ombudsman for a fresh review and to make a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything, Ive reached much the same conclusion as the investigator  
and Ill explain why.
I understand Mr D must be frustrated and that he has experienced inconvenience. But what 
Im considering in this complaint is whether PayPal has acted fairly and reasonably taking 
everything into account.
As explained by our investigator, its clear that PayPals terms set out the circumstances in 
which it can suspend a customers account:
Restricted Activities
In connection with the use of our websites, your PayPal account, the PayPal services, or in 
the course of your interactions with PayPal, other PayPal customers, or third parties, you 
must not:

Abuse (as either a buyer or seller) of our online dispute resolution process and/or 
PayPal Buyer Protection
And
Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities
If we believe that youve engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions 
to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.
The actions we make take include, but are not limited to, the following:

Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your 
account, immediately and without penalty to us;

Suspend your eligibility for Buyer Protection and/or Seller Protection (including in 
retrospect)
Ive also seen an email PayPal sent to Mr D on 15 April 2020 which noted that:
Recently, your account activity has shown several issues with transactions, which you have 
attempted to resolve through PayPal
when customers continue to encounter a higher-than-average rate of issue, we may find it 
necessary to evaluate account activity, and in rare cases, reconsider access to Buyer 
Protection programmes.
Whilst the email said that such situations were rare, I do think that it put Mr D on notice that 
it was a possibility.  
PayPal has provided evidence to show a number of further claims for refunds due to non-
receipt of goods or their quality.  I dont feel it is appropriate to provide further details due to 
the commercially sensitive nature of the claims.  But Im satisfied that as a result of the 
account activity PayPal was entitled to act under the terms of the User Agreement, and that 
it did so fairly and reasonably.
I realise Mr D will likely be disappointed with my decision, but Im unable to say that PayPal 
has done anything wrong.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2021.
