The complaint
Ms B complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to uphold a 
dispute in her buyers favour, resulting in her being left without the item she sold or the 
money she received for it.
What happened
On 19 August 2021, Ms B sold an item to a third-party, who Ill refer to as C, through 
PayPal for £50. But on 30 August, C filed a dispute through PayPals Buyer Protection Policy 
(BPP), stating the item Ms B sold was Significantly Not as Described. C escalated this 
disputed on 13 September and so, PayPal e-mailed Ms B to make her aware a dispute was 
being processed. And within this e-mail, PayPal made Ms B required her to provide further 
information and this would need to be provided within the time frame they set.
On 14, 16 and 21 September, PayPal e-mailed Ms B requesting further information in 
relation to the dispute. And they advised this information would need to be provided by 23 
September. PayPal didnt receive a response from Ms B, so they found in Cs favour and 
refunded them the £50 they paid. And they charged Ms B an additional £12 disputes fee. Ms 
B was unhappy about this, so she raised a complaint.
Ms B didnt think it was fair for PayPal to find in Cs favour and process a refund, which left 
her without the item or the £50 she was paid for it. Ms B disputed Cs dispute, stating it was 
fraudulent and so, didnt think PayPal were reasonable to uphold it. So, Ms B wanted to be 
paid the £50 that had been refunded to the seller and the £12 dispute fee waived.
PayPal didnt agree. They thought theyd acted fairly, and in line with their user agreement 
and BPP, when finding in Cs favour after Ms B failed to respond by the deadline they had 
set. PayPal thought theyd made Ms B reasonably aware further information was needed 
and when it was needed by. So, they didnt think they needed to do anything more. Ms B 
remained unhappy, so she referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. He recognised Ms B was left 
without the dress and the money she was paid for it. So, he understood why Ms B was 
unhappy and felt unfairly treated. But he thought PayPal had given Ms B a reasonable 
opportunity to comply with the disputes process. And as hed seen no evidence to show that 
she did, he thought PayPal had acted within their user agreement and BPP when deciding to 
find in Cs favour. Because of this, he didnt think PayPal needed to do anything further. 
Ms B didnt agree. She reiterated her belief that the item shed sent was as described. And 
so, she maintained her view that C had made a fraudulent claim with PayPal and that 
PayPal had acted unfairly by finding in Cs favour. As Ms B didnt agree, the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Ms B. I understand Ms B feels 
strongly about the condition of the item she sold to C. So, I can appreciate why she feels it is 
unfair that shes been left without the item or the money she received for it, due to PayPals 
decision to find in Cs favour when investigating the dispute C raised. But for me to say 
PayPal have acted unfairly, Id need to be satisfied they acted outside of their user 
agreement and BPP when finding in Cs favour and refunding them the fee they paid, as well 
as charging Ms B a dispute fee. Or, if I think they did act within these, that it was unfair for 
them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful to explain exactly 
what Ive been able to consider. I understand Ms B believes the dispute raised by C is 
fraudulent and that the item was as described. But this isnt something Im able to comment 
on. Instead, my decision has focused on the actions PayPal have taken to ensure the acted 
fairly to Ms B during the dispute process. This includes giving Ms B an opportunity to 
respond to Cs dispute and acting within the terms of their user agreement and BPP. And I 
think they have.
I can see PayPal e-mailed Ms B on 13, 14, 16 and 21 September making Ms B a dispute 
had been raised and requesting she provide them with further information as detailed in their 
resolution centre by no later than 23 September. And PayPal have provided me with 
information that shows at least one of these e-mails were opened.
PayPal have also provided me with details of Ms Bs log ins during that period of time, where 
I can see Ms B logged into her account at various times on various dates. So, I think PayPal 
gave Ms B reasonable notice of their need for further information and when it would be 
needed by. And I think Ms B was able to provide this, as she was logged into her account 
during this time. 
While I recognise Ms B may not always check her e-mails, and may not have felt the need to 
access the resolution centre on her account during that time, I dont PayPal couldve been 
expected to do anything more to ensure Ms B was aware a dispute was ongoing. So, I dont 
think I can say PayPal acted unreasonably.
As Ms B didnt respond, PayPal settled the dispute in the favour of C. And this follows the 
process set out in the terms of their user agreement and the BPP. So, I cant say theyve 
acted outside of these when settling the dispute in this way and arranging for C to be 
refunded the amount they paid.
PayPal also explain they will charge a dispute fee to a seller, in this case Ms B, when they 
process a dispute brought by a buyer, in this case C, with a PayPal account. As C raised a 
dispute, I think PayPal have acted fairly, and in line with the terms of the agreement, when 
charging Ms B the £12 fee.
So, although I do appreciate why Ms B feels as though shes been disadvantaged by PayPal 
and their decision to uphold Cs dispute, I dont think I can say PayPal have done anything 
wrong. PayPal have confirmed that, if Ms B had engaged with the dispute process, they 
wouldve asked C to return the item before issuing a refund. Ive already explained why I 
think PayPal gave Ms B a reasonable chance to engage with this process and so, I dont think its PayPals fault Ms B has been left without the dress or the payment she received for 
it. Because of this, I dont think PayPal need to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Ms Bs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
