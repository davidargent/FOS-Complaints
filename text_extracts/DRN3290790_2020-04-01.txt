K820x#14complaint
Mrs C is unhappy with the cost of her car insurance premiums and considers she has been  
overcharged for many years.  
Mrs C has been represented throughout her complaint by her husband Mr C.
Tesco Personal Finance Plc (Tesco) set the final price in relation to Mrs Cs premium  and 
is therefore responsible for this complaint. 
background
I issued my provisional decision on 3 March  2020.  A copy of my provisional  decision is 
attached and forms part of my final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint. Broadly summarised,  I 
didnt uphold  Mrs Cs complaint as I hadnt  seen anything to suggest  that Tesco had treated 
Mrs C unfairly.
But I was of the opinion that Mrs C faced  unnecessary difficulties in trying to obtain a new 
customer quote from Tesco in 2016. I considered Tesco should pay £200 to compensate 
Mrs C for the trouble caused.
Both parties  had until 17 March 2020 to respond. Neither  party respond by this deadline. I 
allowed a further  extension until 27 March 2020 but received no further  submissions. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As neither party has given  me anything else to consider, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings. 
So it follows,  I dont uphold this complaint   as I havent seen anything to suggest  that Tesco 
increased Mrs Cs premiums unfairly.
But Tesco should pay Mrs C £200 for the trouble  caused when she tried to obtain a new 
customer quote from Tesco in 2016.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and within my provisional decision, I dont uphold 
Mrs Cs complaint.
But I direct  Tesco Personal  Finance  Plc to pay Mrs C £200  compensation for the trouble 
caused when  she tried to obtain a new customer quote in 2016.
Ref: DRN32907902Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.

complaint
Mrs C is unhappy with the cost of her car insurance  premiums and considers she has been  
overcharged for many  years.  
Mrs C has been represented  throughout her complaint by her husband Mr C.
Tesco Personal Finance  PLC (Tesco) set the final price in relation to Mrs Cs premium and is 
therefore responsible for this complaint. 
background
Mrs C took out car insurance  in 2005 for car 1. From 2005  until 2010,  Mrs Cs policy  was underwritten 
by a different insurer.  
In 2011, Tesco became  the underwriter of the policy.  So Tesco  is responsible for any concerns  Mrs 
Cs has about  the cost of her policy from 2011 onwards.

2014 £983.60 30/07/2014 Policy auto-renewed  on 30/07/2014 
(policy also amended in May 2015 - £20 admin fee)
2015 £1,023.44 30/07/2015 Policy auto-renewed  on 30/07/2015
2016 £1,076.30 30/07/2016 Not renewed
     
In 2016, Mrs C contacted Tesco and was told that the renewal price  of £1,076.30 was the best price  it 
could do.
Mrs C said her insurance renewal cost four times as much as another car (car 2) her and her husband 
had, which was also insured with Tesco. Because of this, Mrs C didnt  renew her existing policy.
Mrs C then obtained  a new customer quote from Tesco for her car insurance  which  came in at 
£317.11. Mrs C went ahead with this new policy but considered she had been  overcharged on her old 
policy for the time she had it.
Tesco explained that the price Mrs C had been charged for her existing  policy was correct. It also said 
its new quotes  often include  new customer discounts which arent available to consumers at renewal 
stage on existing policies.
Unhappy with Tescos response, Mrs C referred her complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked at the complaint. She explained that our service didnt  have the power 
to tell an insurer what  it should charge for its insurance, but she could look at whether Mrs C had 
been treated  fairly  throughout the time Tescos were  the insurer. 
She considered  Mrs C, over the lifetime of the policy, hadnt  engaged with Tesco  at each renewal.  For 
the period the insurance cost went down (2012 and 2013), she thought  Tescos werent treating Mrs C 
unfairly. But in 2014 and 2015 the cost went up  and there didnt appear to be any reasons for the 
increases, other than Mrs C not engaging. So she considered Tescos  hadnt treated  Mrs C fairly in 
this period. 
Ref: DRN32907904To put things right, our investigator recommended Tesco  should keep the 2014 and 2015 cost at the 
amount Mrs C paid in 2013  and pay her the difference. She also recommended  that Tesco pay Mrs C 
£200 for the trouble  caused  to Mrs C when  she tried to get a better deal in 2016.
Both parties disagreed with our investigators findings. As the matter hasnt been  resolved, its been 
passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
Having done so, I currently dont think Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld. I know this will come as a 
disappointment to Mrs C, so Id like to explain why.
Before I explain my findings, I would like to clarify  that if Mrs C has any concerns about the cost of her 
insurance before 2011  then that would need  to be directed to the insurer  of the policy at that time.  
Within this decision I can only look at Tescos involvement from 2011 when it became the underwriter 
of the policy. 
I dont have the power to tell a business what its insurance should cost.  I would be, in effect 
determining or telling  a business how it should operate  and thats not my role. But I can look at 
whether Tesco treated Mrs C fairly  throughout the time she held her car insurance policy  with it. 
An insurer isnt necessarily  doing anything  wrong by changing  the premium each year at renewal  
this can happen for a number of reasons. So its not unusual for the cost of an insurance policy  to 
change when  it renews each  year. But because most policies automatically renew,  a customer who 
doesnt shop around or negotiate the price of their policy regularly, may find theyve been paying  more  
than they might have been had they taken out a new policy  either elsewhere or with the same 
insurer.
Where an insurer knows, or ought to know, its customer isnt shopping around or getting  in touch to 
discuss their premium, it should take care to make sure its treating  that customer fairly. And it should  
make sure it doesnt take advantage  of the situation by increasing their premiums beyond  a fair and 
reasonable point, just because they didnt  engage at renewal.
After Tesco became the underwriter  in 2011, Mrs Cs policys cost decreased in price in 2012 and 
again in 2013. So I cant  say that Tesco were treating  Mrs C unfairly during this period given  the 
premium costs went down. 
Our investigator thought as Mrs C didnt engage with Tesco  over the lifetime of the policy, and the 
premiums did increase in 2014 and 2015, Mrs C hadnt been treated fairly.
I dont think thats quite right. As explained above, and importantly, its where an insurer  knows,  or 
ought to know, its customer isnt shopping  around or getting in touch to discuss their premium, that it 
should take care to make  sure its treating that customer fairly.  
From the information Ive seen, while Mrs Cs policy was a policy  that would  automatically renew 
each year, Mrs C proactively  contacted  Tesco  prior to each automatic renewal  in 2011, 2012 and 
2013 to accept  and pay to renew the policy. So presumably Mrs C was happy with the cover  and the 
ongoing costs during that time.  And I note with 2014s insurance,  Mrs C made amendments to the 
policy midterm in May 2015.  
Ref: DRN32907905I do accept that in 2014  and 2015 the policy  did auto renew. But given  Mrs Cs overall history and 
engagement with Tesco  in the previous years, just because policy  automatically renewed in 2014 and 
2015, doesnt  mean Tesco  would have been aware  or ought to have known  that Mrs C wasnt the 
type to shop  around  or that she was no longer  engaging  at renewal  and took advantage of her 
because of that. 
Mrs C says being a loyal customer she thought she was getting the best price. And because  she 
ultimately obtained  a cheaper insurance policy with Tesco, she was overcharged  over the years. Mrs 
C says she should get the difference back on any extra amount she paid.
I understand Mrs Cs frustrations, but Tesco wasnt a broker  whose obligations might be to shop 
around each  year for its consumers to get the best deal year on year. Tesco provided an insurance 
policy  and while it later introduced another insurance  product  theres  no requirement  for Tesco to 
automatically switch its existing  customer base on to the new policy  indeed,  this might not be right 
for all customers.
There are now rules  (that were introduced  in 2017) that say insurers  should, in the renewal invitation,  
encourage their customers to shop around if theyve had their policy for a number of years.  These 
didnt exist when Mrs C had her (older) policy with Tesco  and even if they had, they dont go as far as 
to say insurers need  to tell their customers about alternative products. So I dont think Tesco needed 
to tell her when the new product was introduced.
Im also mindful  that within  Mrs Cs testimony, she mentions  her and her husbands other car (car 2) 
which was also insured  with Tesco. Mrs C has said it was insured for considerably  less. As explained 
above, I cant  tell an insurer what it should charge.  And also within  this decision I can only look at the 
policy being complained about. But I do understand why Mrs C uses it as a comparison to support her 
argument that she was overcharged. 
Tesco has confirmed  that in relation to car 2, the policy taken out in 2015 was Tescos new insurance 
product. Tesco says it is a different car and is insured under a different  policy which also included a 
new customer  discount  and therefore cant be used as a comparison.  I agree, and I would also like to 
add that it seems that between Mr and Mrs C, they might have realised  sooner  that their policies were 
so differently priced.
With regards to the trouble  Mrs C faced  in trying to obtain a new customer quote  from Tesco in 2016.  
I agree with our investigator  that Mrs C faced unnecessary difficulties and agree that £200 should  be 
awarded to compensate Mrs C.
my provisional  decision
As it stands,  I dont uphold this complaint. But I do consider  that Tesco Personal Finance PLC should 
pay Mrs C £200 for the trouble caused.
