The complaint
Miss Q complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCAs (PayPal) decision to lend to 
her.
What happened
Miss Q entered into a credit agreement with PayPal in March 2019. The credit limit provided 
to Miss Q was £2,500. 
In early 2021, Miss Q fell into financial difficulties and requested that PayPal grant her a 
payment holiday. She made an offer to pay £40 per month towards her outstanding balance. 
PayPal said it wasnt authorising any new payment deferrals, but it asked Miss Q to fill out 
an income and expenditure form. Miss Q did this, but PayPal asked her to contact it so it 
could query some of the figures Miss Q had input. 
Following this, Miss Q complained to PayPal and said she thought it had lent irresponsibly to 
her. She said at the time the lending was approved, she was in serious financial difficulty 
and relied on high cost credit. She said because PayPals credit facility was high interest, 
this caused her financial issues to spiral. She said she wanted PayPal to agree to a 
repayment plan of £40 per month, refund any interest and charges she had paid and to 
amend her credit file. 
PayPal issued its response to Miss Qs complaint in April 2021. It said it had carried out 
checks and considered whether Miss Q would be able to afford the credit, before deciding to 
lend to her. It issued a further response to Miss Q and said it had asked Miss Q to contact it 
to set up a feasible repayment plan, it tried to contact her about the increase in fees and it 
couldnt remove adverse information from her credit file. 
Unhappy with this, Miss Q referred her complaint to this service. She said she thought 
PayPal had acted irresponsibly by making the credit facility available to her. She said at the 
time she was relying on high cost credit. She said after she fell into financial difficulties, she 
asked PayPal to apply a payment holiday, but it refused to do this. She also said it told her to 
complete an income and expenditure assessment in April 2021 and she did this, but it didnt 
respond. She also said she had severe mental health issues but acknowledged that she only 
disclosed this when she raised a complaint. She said her mental health issues made it 
difficult for her to communicate by phone. So, she said she asked PayPal to communicate 
with her in writing, but instead it continued to call her. 
Since Miss Q referred her complaint to this service, PayPal has agreed a repayment plan 
with Miss Q. She says that it has told her it may apply a default and although she 
acknowledges it is within its right to do this, it is unreasonable for it to do this, given her 
circumstances.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and he thought PayPal had made an unfair 
lending decision when lending to Miss Q. He said the checks PayPal completed 
demonstrated that Miss Q wouldnt be able to make repayments in a sustainable manner. 
But he didnt think PayPal had acted unreasonably when it reviewed Miss Qs complaint or 
when it asked her to complete income and expenditure assessments. He recommended that 
PayPal refund all the interest and charges Miss Q had paid to date, repay any overpayments 
made with applicable interest and remove any adverse information reported to credit 
reference agencies. 
Miss Q agreed. But PayPal disagreed. It said the checks it had carried out before lending 
didnt show any defaulted accounts in the 12 months prior to the lending application and it 
didnt show that Miss Q had significant outstanding debt. It said it had calculated Miss Qs 
income and expenditure and this showed Miss Q had a significant disposable income to be 
able to make the repayments owed under the agreement. 
Our investigator responded and said he agreed there were no defaulted accounts in the 12 
months prior to the lending application, but he said Miss Q still had some defaulted accounts 
being reported to her credit file at the time. He said he thought Miss Q had significant 
outstanding debt and when PayPal approved the application. And he said by PayPal 
granting Miss Q further borrowing, it was increasing her borrowing and this was harmful to 
Miss Q. So he thought PayPal had made an unfair lending decision. 
PayPal disagreed. So, the case was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision on 13 December 2022 in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Ive read and considered the whole file and acknowledge that Miss Q has raised a number of 
different complaint points. Ive concentrated on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on 
any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it  but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome. 
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints on our website 
 including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. Ive considered 
this approach while deciding Miss Qs complaint. 
Before deciding to lend, PayPal needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks, to 
satisfy itself that Miss Q would be able to repay what she borrowed in a sustainable way. 
A proportionate check is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  
Miss Qs particular circumstances (e.g. her financial history, current situation and outlook, 
and any indications of vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit 
she was looking to obtain. The checks should be borrower focused and PayPal needed to 
ensure the payments under the lending agreement wouldnt cause Miss Q any undue 
difficulty. There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate 
check should have been  such as any indications of borrower vulnerability and any 
foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Miss Q was also given a credit facility where there was an expectation that shed repay what 
she borrowed plus the interest due, within a reasonable period of time. The relevant rules, 
regulations and guidance in the period PayPal lent to Miss Q dont set out what a reasonable 
period of time is. So I think its important to note that a reasonable period of time will always 
be dependent on the circumstances of the individual case.
Ive kept all of this in mind when thinking about whether PayPal did what it was required to 
do before agreeing to lend to Miss Q. When deciding to lend to Miss Q, PayPal says that 
Miss Q provided income details on her application and she passed its affordability checks, 
which were based on external credit bureau data. 
The application shows Miss Q had confirmed she was working full time and she had a 
monthly net income of between £1,501 and £2,000. Miss Q also confirmed that her monthly 
living expenses and her net monthly mortgage expenses were each between £1 and £500. 
PayPal has also provided evidence to show what the credit search showed. At the time of 
lending, the credit search obtained by PayPal confirmed that Miss Q had no defaults applied 
in the last 24 months and no delinquent accounts. PayPal also obtained information about 
Miss Qs total outstanding credit balance, the number of accounts she had and the repayments owed across them. As the information showed Miss Qs outstanding credit 
commitments were relatively low and she had no adverse information reported to her credit 
file in the previous 24 months, Miss Qs application fell within PayPals lending criteria. 
Ive thought about this carefully and reviewed the information PayPal obtained about Miss Q 
before lending to her. Miss Qs declared income at the time, together with there not being 
anything concerning on her credit file, leads me to think that it was fair for PayPal to 
conclude Miss Q would be able to repay the amount it lent to her, within a reasonable period 
of time. In addition, I dont think there was anything in the information PayPal obtained that 
would suggest to it that Miss Q wouldnt be able to repay the amount she borrowed 
sustainably. So I dont think PayPal made an unfair lending decision when it provided Miss Q 
with a credit agreement that had a limit of £2,500. 
I appreciate Miss Q has provided our service with her credit file from the time of lending 
which shows additional information to what PayPal obtained at the time. However, given the 
factors PayPal had to take into account at the time of lending, it wasnt required to obtain this 
information. And I dont think it needed to, given that I think it obtained reasonable and 
proportionate information to enable it to make a fair lending decision. 
Did PayPal act unfairly in any other way? 
Miss Q let PayPal know in April 2021 that she preferred to be contacted by email as she had 
an outstanding complaint with this service and wanted a record of her communication. 
Following this, PayPal attempted to contact Miss Q by phone and left voicemails each time it 
couldnt contact her. It also sent her emails. In September 2021, Miss Q let PayPal know she 
couldnt call it due to health reasons. Following this, I cant see that PayPal attempted to call 
Miss Q. 
Having thought about this, I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly. I note Miss Qs preferred 
communication method was email, but PayPal attempted to contact Miss Q through this 
method and didnt receive a response from her. So it also tried to contact her by phone. 
Given that Miss Qs account was at risk of having adverse information reported to credit 
reference agencies at the time, I dont think PayPal has acted unreasonably as it wasnt 
getting a response from Miss Q and so it attempted other ways to contact her.
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I do not intend to uphold Miss Qs complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal responded to my provisional decision and said it didnt have any further information 
to provide. 
Miss Q didnt respond to my provisional decision.
As no new evidence has been provided for me to consider following my provisional decision, 
it follows that there is no reason for me to reach any different conclusion than set out in my 
provisional decision.
My final decision
I do not uphold Miss Qs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss Q to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 February 2023.
