K821x#15complaint
Miss K complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny was 
irresponsible when  it provided her with 21 high-cost short-term instalment loans between  
June 2015 and April 2017.
background
Miss K took 21 loans  with Sunny between 14 June 2015 and 10 April 2017. All the loans 
were to be repaid  through six monthly  instalments. The amounts of the loans varied between 
£50 and £800. I've prepared a table showing some  of the information Sunny has provided 
about Miss Ks loans.  This can be found  in the annex to this decision.
One of our adjudicators looked  into Miss Ks complaint and recommended  that it be partially  
upheld. She didnt think that Sunny  shouldve  provided Loan 4 onwards to Miss K. Sunny 
doesnt agree so the matter has come  to me for a final decision.  If Miss K accepts my 
decision it will be binding  on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss K could 
repay her loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Ks 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN31022842Sunny was required to establish whether Miss K could sustainably  repay  her loans   not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Whilst 
that might  be an indication a borrower  could sustainably make their repayments, it doesnt 
automatically follow. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as meaning 
that a borrower  could  repay the loans over the term of the agreement  without undue  
difficulties, on time,  whilst meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to 
borrow to meet those  repayments. And the regulations said that an assessment should  take 
into account more  than simply assessing  the customer's ability  to repay  the credit.
With this in mind Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided and what  this all means for Miss Ks complaint. As neither party has disagreed with 
our adjudicator about her conclusions in relation to Loans 1, 2 and 3 I'm not going to 
consider those further except so far as they provide  broader context  to Miss Ks borrowing 
relationship with Sunny.
Miss K began borrowing from Sunny in June 2015  a loan of £150. As I've mentioned all 
her loans were due to be repaid over six months.  But Miss K repaid Loan 1 after ten days. 
Less than three weeks later she returned  to Sunny for Loan  2: this was again for £150. And 
again she repaid it early   after only 12 days. 
Miss Ks third loan was taken six days after she repaid Loan 2 and it was for more  than double  
her earlier loans - £400. This also meant that her repayments were due to be significantly 
higher at almost  £129 per month instead  of around £48 per month for Loans 1 and 2.
Whilst early repayment of a loan may suggest  that a consumer has the sustainable means  to 
do this, a pattern  of borrowing  and repaying several  loans one after the other  suggests  to me 
that the consumers financial  situation  is not a stable  one  after all, if they know  they would 
have the means  to repay a loan within a couple of weeks,  why would they agree to repay 
over six months and thereby cost themselves a lot more  in additional interest  payments. This 
suggests to me that they are likely  to be giving themselves some breathing space  in a 
potentially volatile financial  situation.   
Miss K didnt repay  Loan 3 within  a couple  of weeks as she had with Loans  1 and 2. In fact 
her pattern  of borrowing  and repaying early changed: seven weeks  into Loan 3 Miss K 
borrowed Loan 4  without repaying Loan  3. And this was for an even higher amount at 
£550. As she had two loans outstanding  it meant  she had two lots of repayments  - totalling 
almost £295 per month.
At the point Miss K took Loan 4 she had declared that her monthly income  had increased 
from £1,564 to £2,136. This is a significant  increase but it doesnt  seem that Sunny took any 
more steps to verify it than it had for the earlier loans. Additionally,  Miss Ks declared  
monthly expenditure on credit had reduced  from £1,080 at Loan 1 to £604 by Loan  4. 
This meant that Miss Ks stated disposable  income (the amount she had left after shed paid 
her declared  expenditure and from which she would repay her loans) had more than trebled 
from £459 to £1,432.  And yet here she was asking to borrow Loan 4 whilst Loan  3 was still 
outstanding. I think that Sunny shouldve been doing  a full review of Miss Ks financial 
circumstances at the point she took Loan  4. As it didnt Im satisfied that it failed to do a 
proportionate check.
Ref: DRN31022843What Sunny did have  was a history of lending  to Miss K which in itself suggested that Loan 4 
was unlikely to be repaid  sustainably. And as such Sunny shouldnt  have provided it to 
Miss K. This was her fourth advance in three months for the highest amount yet  whilst 
Loan 3 was still outstanding.
Miss K repaid Loans 3 and 4 on the same day. She paid Sunny a total of £904  to clear those 
two loans. 
Eighteen days later Miss K applied for Loan  5 and was provided with a loan of £400. This 
was now her fifth loan in four months and as with Loan 4 it was unlikely shed be able to 
repay this sustainably given the background. The indications were that Miss K was 
struggling financially  - she was borrowing much higher  sums  (than  she had at the beginning) 
in quick succession.  That wasnt a sustainable  situation.
Twelve days after taking  Loan 5 - and before Miss K had made  any repayments towards 
Loan 5 - she took Loan 6 for £550. This meant that the whole of the principal sums on both 
Loans 5 and 6 was outstanding - £950.  And they were due to be repaid over the following six 
months at around £290 per month.  
Ive looked at this overall pattern of Miss Ks lending history with Sunny and I think  that at the 
point she took Loan 6, it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny shouldve  declined further loans. 
Miss K had taken out six loans within around 19 weeks  all of which were supposed to have 
run for six months. Each time she repaid her balance and so was in the clear, she returned 
a very short  time later to borrow again. So, it was more likely than not Miss K had to borrow  
further to cover the holes left in her finances  by the repayment of earlier loans. 
Additionally the amounts Miss K was borrowing were generally increasing   and having 
borrowed £150 for Loan 1, Loans  4 and 6 were for £550. So Sunny ought  to have known 
that Miss K was unlikely to be borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to 
meet an ongoing  need. 
As Miss K wasnt  making any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny  it meant that she 
paid high rates of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.  I 
acknowledge that there was a gap of around  23 weeks  between Miss K repaying Loan  20 
and taking Loan 21. But before that shed taken twenty instalment loans over the previous 
sixteen months. So Im not persuaded that Sunny could be satisfied that Miss Ks earlier 
cycle of reliance on short  term credit had been broken during that gap  especially as 
Loan 21 was for £450 when her previous two loans  had been for £200.  
Overall, I'm satisfied that Sunny caused  Miss K to lose out when it continued to lend to her in 
this unsustainable  way because these loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging her 
indebtedness by allowing  her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period  of time. And the number  of loans, together  with the length of time over 
which Miss K borrowed, was likely  to have had negative implications on her ability  to access  
mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for this type of high cost product.
So Im also upholding  Miss Ks complaint about Loan 4 onwards and require Sunny to put 
things right.
Ref: DRN31022844putting things right
As Sunny should not have  provided  Miss K with Loans 4 to 21 (taken between 
17 September 2015 and 10 April 2017) I require it to:
refund all interest  and charges Miss K  paid  on Loans 4 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative  information about  Loans  4 and 5 from Miss Ks credit  file; the 
number of loans  taken from Loan 6 onwards  means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries  about Loans 6 to 21 should be removed  from Miss Ks 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss K a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ks complaint.  I require Elevate 
Credit International  Limited to put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October  2019.
