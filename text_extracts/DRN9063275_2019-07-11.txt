K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs B have  complained about poor service  and delay by Target Servicing Limited in 
relation to the redemption of their Help to Buy (HTB)  loan. To settle the complaint Mr and 
Mrs B want  Target to pay them compensation of £8,000.
background
In June 2014 Mr and Mrs B had purchased  a property  with the assistance of a HTB loan. 
This is a Government scheme where a loan is made available to help buyers purchase a 
property. It is expressed as a percentage of the property purchase price  in other words, an 
equity share.  When the property is sold or remortgaged, the Government is repaid the 
amount of its equity  share based  on the valuation or sale price of the property.
In Mr and Mrs Bs case, the initial property purchase was for £444,950,  with a HTB loan of 
20% (£88,990). The loan was administered by Target.
In 2017 Mr and Mrs B were looking to remortgage. As a result,  theyd need to repay  the HTB 
loan in full. They had the property valued on 6 March 2017  at £485,000, which would  mean 
theyd need to repay £97,000 for the HTB element. They sent Target the required 
documentation and administrative  fees in April and May of 2017. Having heard nothing  back 
by July 2017, they chased the matter up with Target  and also put the house on the market.
Target admitted  that the application hadnt  been  processed as it had failed to add all the 
documentation to Targets internal  computer  system. By this time the valuation had expired. 
On 4 August  2017 Mr and Mrs B sold the property for £525,000. This was the revaluation 
figure used  for calculating  the amount of the HTB element to be repaid, which was £105,000.
Mr and Mrs B complained to Target. They said theyve had to pay an additional £8,000 for 
the HTB loan when they sold the property than theyd have paid if the remortgage had gone 
through.
Target acknowledged its service hadnt  been up to the required standard  and offered 
compensation of £290 made  up of the valuation fee and an additional £200.  But it didnt 
think it should reimburse Mr and Mrs B for the £8,000. 
Unhappy with Targets response, Mr and Mrs B brought their complaint to us where  it was 
considered by an investigator. He thought the complaint should be upheld. He asked Target 
to reimburse the second valuation fee of £90 and the £200 redemption  fee. He also asked 
Target to pay compensation for trouble and upset of £500.
But the investigator didnt think Target  should reimburse Mr and Mrs B for the additional 
£8,000 theyd had to pay for redeeming the HTB loan when  they sold the property. Thats 
because, by selling for a much higher price  than the March 2017 remortgage  valuation, 
theyd suffered no financial loss and had in fact benefitted by an additional £32,000.
Mr and Mrs B disagreed with the investigators  findings. In summary they say that, 
irrespective of the increase in the value of the property, theyve suffered a loss of £8,000. 
They had the money available in their bank account to settle  the HTB loan. They  say the 
house increased in value  between March and August 2017 through their hard work, effort 
and market circumstances. So its not right they arent awarded their loss of £8,000.
Ref: DRN90632752Target said that if Mr and Mrs B were  able to provide evidence that they had lost £8,000, it 
would review this. The investigator told Mr and Mrs B this on 16 May 2019, but they have  not 
provided any further evidence of financial loss. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator, for largely the same reason.
Target doesnt dispute its customer service  fell short of the standard expected  on this 
occasion. So all I need to decide is what level of compensation is fair and reasonable. There 
is clearly a disparity in what  the parties want;  Mr and Mrs B are asking for £8,000. Target 
thinks £290 is fair. The investigator  thought  target should pay the £290 plus £500  for trouble 
and upset.
Having considered the matter carefully,  Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs B should be 
reimbursed the £8,000  by Target.  Mr and Mrs B have  insisted  that when they intended to 
remortgage in March 2017, they had the full amount of the HTB loan in cash at the bank and 
so could have  paid this loan off in full. No evidence  has been provided of this.
When they sold the property in August 2017 Mr and Mrs B materially changed their position. 
Although theyve said the increase in value of the property between March  and August 2017 
is as a result  of their hard work, I think its more likely to be because of market  conditions. 
Indeed, that is the view reached by the valuer.  But by selling the property, Mr and Mrs B 
have benefitted  by a net amount  of £32,000,  being  the increase in equity of £40,000 which  
they received  from the sale proceeds, less the extra £8,000 they had to pay to redeem the 
HTB loan. 
In the circumstances, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable to order  Target to 
reimburse Mr and Mrs B for the £8,000 they are claiming. 
I agree  that Target should reimburse  Mr and Mrs B for the revaluation  fee and the 
redemption fee, a total of £290. I also agree with the investigator that a payment for trouble 
and upset is warranted. I think £500 for this is proportionate,  fair and reasonable.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of this complaint, 
Target Servicing  Limited  must pay Mr and Mrs B a total of £790, being £290  for 
reimbursement of fees and £500  for trouble and upset. I make  no other order  or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  11 August 2019.
