In our adjudicators latest findings  he thought Cashfloat had treated Mr M fairly when it gave 
him loans  1  3. However, he didnt think that any of the remaining loans shouldve  been 
provided.  
By loan 4, the adjudicator  thought Cashfloats  checks needed to go further due to the quick  
up take in lending. But he thought that had further checks  been carried out, Cashfloat 
wouldve likely seen that Mr M was in a position  to take on this loan. 
However, the adjudicator didnt think that loans 5 and 6 shouldve been given because  
proportionate checks wouldve  likely  shown Cashfloat that Mr M didnt have enough 
disposable income to be able to afford  the repayments he was committed  to making. 
The adjudicator also thought a pattern of lending had been  established  by loan 7 as Mr M 
had taken 5 loans in 3 months so he didnt think  any further loans were sustainable. 
Mr M accepted the adjudicators findings.   
However, Cashfloat didnt accept the adjudicators findings. It made several points including:
some of the loans  were repaid within the 14 day cooling off period and so these 
shouldnt be included  in the loan cycle,  
loan 4 was for half the amount of loan 3, which shows  Mr M wasnt  caught in a debt 
spiral,
Cashfloat says the income and expenditure should be adjusted to take into account 
Mr Ms partners  earnings,  
from loan 7 the information obtained from the credit reference agencies  shows that 
Mr Ms financial position  was improving and 
it would be irresponsible to remove loan information from Mr Ms credit  file.  
However, in response  to our first assessment Cashfloat did offer a goodwill payment of 
£100, in order  to settle the complaint but Mr M didnt accept this. 
As no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
Ref: DRN13870342my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr M didnt  disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans  1 to 4. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr M had with Cashfloat. 
So they are something  I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
Cashfloat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to figure out 
whether Mr M could repay  the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cashfloat should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Cashfloat  was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably  repay  his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr M could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Firstly, I accept that loan 4 was for half the amount of loan 3, but the loan was still larger  
than loan 1, which was only taken out around  4 weeks  earlier. However, the adjudicator 
didnt uphold  this loan, so I see no reason to expand on why this loan shouldnt be refunded,  
as Mr M hasnt  disagreed  with what the adjudicator said.   
Ref: DRN13870343Instead, Ill start by addressing some  of Cashfloats  concerns  that it raised in response to our 
adjudicators assessment.  Like the adjudicator I think it is fair to include the first few loans  in 
the loan cycle, even though these were  repaid  early  because  they still form part of Mr Ms 
lending history. And, even if I did think about Mr Ms partners contribution to household bills 
 such as the mortgage the outcome Ive reached  wouldve remained the same. 
I think the loans  should be included because firstly, at the time that the loans were  approved  
Cashfloat wasnt expecting Mr M to withdraw  from the loans agreements. Secondly,  a 
lending decision was made, so I think in these  circumstances,  it is reasonable to think  about  
the checks that Cashfloat carried out on the assumption that the early  loans would run to 
term because that is what Cashfloat expected to happen. So for these reasons like the 
adjudicator, I also think by loan 5, Cashfloats  checks needed to go further  including verifying 
the income and expenditure  information  Mr M had provided.  
So, as our adjudicator  explained, proportionate checks for loans 5 and 6 would most likely 
have shown that:
Mr M wasnt in a position to take on these loans. Proportionate checks  wouldve likely 
shown Cashfloat  that Mr M had borrowed  significant amounts of money from friends  
and family in the month leading up to these loans  funds  that had to be repaid. 
His account was nearly always overdrawn, even after being paid. This led to him 
incurring additional  bank charges along with charges  for returned direct debt.
Finally, Cashfloat wouldve also been  aware that Mr M had a number  of longer-term 
loan commitments  with other  providers,  which took up a significant  portion of his 
income. 
So, in these circumstances,  there  was a significant  risk that Mr M wouldnt have been  able to 
repay this loan or any further loan without  undue difficulty or without the need to borrow  
again. 
Ive thought about what Cashfloat says about  the credit reports  theyve provided showing 
Mr Ms overall indebtedness decreasing with other lenders. While this may be an indication 
that his overall  position may have  been  improving, I cant ignore that Mr M indebtedness 
hadnt decreased  with Cashfloat. And, as Ive mentioned above, Im considering  whether 
Cashfloat was correct in providing  its loans to Mr M. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 and 6 and Cashfloat should put things right as 
detailed below.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 10 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Cashfloats  
lending history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if there was a point  at which  Cashfloat  
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so Cashfloat  should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. I 
think this point was reached by loan 7, I say this because:
by this stage, Mr M was into his fourth month of owing Cashfloat money. In my view, 
Mr Ms loan history  up until this point was in itself a clear demonstration of his 
inability to use these  loans as Cashfloat had intended.
Ref: DRN13870344Mr M continued  to be provided  with new loans shortly after having repaid previous 
ones. And the amounts he was borrowing werent decreasing. So Cashfloat ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further to cover  
the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in his finances  and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness wasnt decreasing and so the loans  were  unsustainable. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed Cashfloat and his 
indebtedness was being prolonged for an extended  period of time. Loan 10 was 
provided six months after loan 1 and was for more than three times the value. This 
meant that Mr M paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to 
Cashfloat over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Cashfloat  provided loans 7 - 10 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; 
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Ms complaint and Cashfloat should  put things right as set out 
below.
Finally, Ive considered  what Cashfloat has said about removing loans from the credit file, 
but this forms part of our well-defined approach when looking  at irresponsible  lending  cases.  
When the lending  decisions  reach  a point  where  we no longer think it is sustainable for the 
loans to have  been provided,  we consider the loan entries to be adverse,  and as a direct 
result of a businesss mistake. Which is why, I am directing some of the loans that Mr M was 
granted be removed  from his credit file. 
putting things right  what Cashfloat  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  5 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 6 from Mr Ms credit file 
remove loans 7 - 10 from Mr Ms credit file entirely. This is because  of the time Mr M 
spent in debt,  meaning  any information about  those loans  adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cashfloat  to take off tax from this interest. Cashfloat 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN13870345my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
Western Circle Ltd should put things  right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.
