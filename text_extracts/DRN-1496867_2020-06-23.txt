Complaint
Ms G complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Ms G says she was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Ms G took out some 26 instalment loans from Sunny between August 
2016 and May 2019. Ive enclosed a summary of Ms Gs borrowing with Sunny, based on 
the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan number 6 onwards. Sunny made an offer to otherwise settle the 
complaint but Ms G doesnt agree to this. So the complaint has come to me for an 
ombudsmans final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Ms Gs 
complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Ms G could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought 
to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the 
total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Sunny should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
DRN-1496867refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms G could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Ms G could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Ms G. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks which Sunny most likely carried out would have been quite basic ones. But I also 
think these would have probably been proportionate for loans 1  4. I think these levels of 
checks, together with the income and expenditure details provided by Ms G, would have 
made those particular early loans appear affordable. 
I think that by loan number 5, Sunny should have been doing more to check that Ms Gs 
financial situation supported further lending and I dont see that this happened. However, I 
havent been sent any evidence that shows this would have actually made any difference. 
Based on what Ms G had said about her earnings and outgoings for example, I still think that 
Sunny would have thought more lending was affordable, even if its financial checks had 
been more searching. I therefore dont uphold the complaint in respect of loans 1  5.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked different and therefore required a more responsible 
approach. The overall pattern of Sunnys lending to Ms G at the point of loan 6 should have 
caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
This is because this was Ms Gs sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in 7 months or 
so. And in common with her borrowing pattern thus far, Ms G was again being lent money 
whilst previous loans were still outstanding. Sunny ought to have realised that Ms G wasnt 
merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; she was borrowing regularly, 
to address shortfalls in her income and to meet an ongoing need. She was having to 
consistently take out high interest, short-term lending over a sustained period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Sunny should have 
realised Ms G was at risk of not managing to repay the loans sustainably or getting into 
financial difficulties. 
So Im upholding this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 26. Sunny repeatedly lent to Ms G in 
an unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; andthe length of time over which Ms G borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans
 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Ms G paid on loans 6 - 26;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 - 26 should be completely 
removed from Ms Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Ms Gs complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited 
should put things right for Ms G as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
