The complaint
Mr M feels that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly deprived him from being 
able to obtain a Bounce Bank Loan (BBL) for his business by making him apply for a BBL 
feeder account which he doesnt feel he would have been approved for.
What happened
Mr M applied to NatWest for a BBL and was told that it was a requirement of NatWest that a 
BBL applicant must hold a business relationship with NatWest and that a BBL be 
administered via a NatWest business bank account. Mr M didnt hold a business relationship 
with NatWest and instead used his personal NatWest current account to administer his 
businesss finances. This meant that Mr M would first need to apply for a NatWest BBL 
feeder account  a type of NatWest business bank account specifically intended to be used 
to administer a BBL  before being able to apply for a BBL.
Mr M applied for a NatWest feeder account. But he didnt feel he would meet NatWests 
criteria for his application to be successful and so he didnt provide the documents requested 
by NatWest to allow his application to potentially progress. This meant that NatWest then 
cancelled his application. Mr M wasnt happy about this and felt he was effectively being 
denied access to a BBL because of NatWests requirement for him to hold a business 
relationship with them, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Ms complaint. They explained this matter as they saw it from their 
perspective  which was that Mr M had applied for a BBL feeder account but then not 
supplied the necessary supporting documents to enable the application to be progressed 
and considered  and because of this NatWest didnt feel theyd acted unfairly by cancelling 
Mr Ms BBL feeder account application as they had. Mr M wasnt satisfied with NatWests 
response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that NatWest were entitled to 
require a BBL applicant to hold a business relationship with them, and so they didnt feel that 
NatWest had acted unfairly by requiring Mr M to apply for a BBL feeder account, or in how 
theyd then managed Mr Ms BBL feeder account application. Mr M remained dissatisfied, so 
the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The conditions of the BBL scheme included that eligible businesses would be subject to 
standard customer fraud, Anti-Money Laundering, and Know Your Customer checks, and it 
was in part for this reason that lenders who took part in the scheme  such as NatWest  
were entitled to require an applicant business to hold a business relationship with them in 
order to be eligible with the lender to apply for a BBL.
As such, Im satisfied that it was fair that NatWest required Mr M to apply for a BBL feeder 
account before allowing any application for a BBL itself to take place.
This also means that if Mr M didnt meet NatWests requirements for the BBL feeder account 
to be opened, then Im satisfied that it would fairly and reasonably follow that that Mr M 
wouldnt be able to apply for a BBL with NatWest. 
Mr M didnt provide the documents in support of his BBL feeder account application to 
NatWest, and so it isnt known whether that application would have been successful or not. 
However, if Mr Ms BBL feeder account application had been declined by NatWest on the 
basis of NatWests eligibility or creditworthiness criteria, then I dont feel that this would 
constitute an act of NatWest unfairly depriving Mr M access to a BBL as he maintains. 
Rather, I feel that it would simply be the case that Mr M was never going to be successful in 
his application to NatWest for a BBL  because he would have always needed a NatWest 
business account, but didnt meet NatWests criteria for one. 
This doesnt seem unfair or reasonable to me, and I say this because as explained Im 
satisfied that it was fair for NatWest to require BBL applicants to hold a business relationship 
with them, and Im also satisfied that NatWest could consider applications to enter into a 
business relationship with them on the basis of their own criteria. 
Finally, it should also be noted that Mr M was free to apply to other lenders for a BBL if he 
was concerned that NatWest wouldnt deem him eligible to hold a business relationship with 
them, as NatWest required.
All of which means that Im satisfied NatWest havent acted unfairly towards Mr M here as 
Mr M maintains, and it therefore follows that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing 
NatWest to take any further action. I trust that Mr M will understand, given all that Ive 
explained, why Ive made the final decision here that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2023.
