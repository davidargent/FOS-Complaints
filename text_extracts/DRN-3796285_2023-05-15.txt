The complaint
Mrs T complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she and her husband have paid for some 
holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal 
adviser.
What happened
Mrs T and her husband had bought a holiday product in June 2002 and they entered into a 
purchase agreement in September 2007 to trade-in that product to buy some holiday club 
membership points. The net purchase price due from them was £5,750 and Mrs T entered 
into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance and she used £5,750 of that 
credit to pay the amount due to the holiday company. The credit was on buy now  pay 
later terms so the purchase price wasnt charged to her account for six months. Mrs T 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £5,750 
in March 2008 to repay that credit. She agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £83.85 
to Barclays Partner Finance. Mrs T repaid that loan in August 2010.
Mrs T and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in September 2009 to buy 
some more holiday club membership points. The purchase price of the additional points was 
£8,500 and I understand that Mrs T entered into another credit card agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance and she used £8,500 of that credit to pay the amount due to the holiday 
company. The credit was on the same buy now  pay later terms. 
Mrs T and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in August 2010 to buy 
more holiday club membership points and Mrs T used £7,130 of the credit that was available 
to pay the purchase price to the holiday company. The outstanding balance of the credit that 
had been provided to her in September 2009 was settled at that time. The credit provided 
under the credit card agreement was settled in full in July 2015.
Mrs T and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in November 2015 to buy 
more holiday club membership points and the holiday company confirmed that they would be 
able to surrender their points five years later at no additional cost. Mrs T also entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £13,600. She agreed 
to make 120 monthly repayments of £183.93 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mrs Ts representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in September 2019 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the points had been 
misrepresented to Mrs T and her husband, the holiday company used undue influence and 
breached the contracts, and the terms of the contracts, the misleading actions and 
omissions of the holiday company and the aggressive sales practices that it used created an 
unfair relationship between Barclays Partner Finance and Mrs T. It also said that no proper 
assessment was done to assess Mrs Ts creditworthiness before providing credit and 
making loans to her and that no affordability checks were carried out by the holiday 
company.
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ts 
complaint should be upheld and she set out the reasons that she didnt think that Barclays 
Partner Finance needed to take any action. 
Mrs Ts representative, on her behalf, said that it didnt accept those recommendations and 
was granted more time to make further submissions but no further submissions about this 
compliant have been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ts complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ts complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that 
shed made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six 
years of her claims being made to it - but I need to consider whether the Limitation 
Act 1980 applies to her claims;
Mrs Ts claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Ts claim under section 75 is that there have been breaches of contract by the 
holiday company and that the membership points were misrepresented to her and 
her husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs T could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into their September 2007 purchase of membership points in September 
2007 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations about that purchase 
would have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when she also entered into the credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;I consider that her cause of action about those misrepresentations accrued at that 
time, so she would have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim 
against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a 
misrepresentation claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until September 
2019, about twelve years later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to that claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have 
rejected that claim;
I consider that Mrs T could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into their September 2009 purchase of membership points in September 
2009 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations about that purchase 
would have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when she also entered into her second credit card agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
I consider that her cause of action about those misrepresentations accrued at that 
time, so she would have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim 
against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a 
misrepresentation claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until September 
2019, about ten years later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to that claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have 
rejected that claim;
I consider that Mrs T could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into their August 2010 purchase of membership points in August 2010 as 
that was the latest time that any misrepresentations about that purchase would have 
been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was when she 
used credit provided by Barclays Partner Finance to pay for those points;
I consider that her cause of action about those misrepresentations accrued at that 
time, so she would have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim 
against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a 
misrepresentation claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance until September 
2019, more than nine years later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to that claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have 
rejected that claim;
I consider that Mrs T could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into their November 2015 purchase of membership points in November 
2015 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations about that purchase 
would have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was 
when she entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for 
those points;
I consider that her cause of action about those misrepresentations accrued at that 
time and her misrepresentation claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance within 
six years of that date so I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for 
Barclays Partner Finance to have properly considered those claims - and Ive 
considered whether or not Mrs T and her husband were induced into entering into the 
November 2015 purchase agreement by misrepresentations made by the holiday 
company later in this decision;
Mrs Ts representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the holiday 
company and the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the 
date on which the cause of action accrued but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any breach of contract by the holiday company 
for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable under section 75;
Mrs Ts representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs T and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit card 
agreement that Mrs T entered into in September 2007 ended when the credit was 
refinanced in April 2008 and that the loan that was made to her in April 2008 was 
settled in August 2010 but a claim under section 140A wasnt made to Barclays 
Partner Finance until September 2019, more than nine years later, so I consider that 
Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to a section 140A claim about the unfairness 
of her relationship with Barclays Partner Finance under those agreements and I find 
that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected those claims;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit card 
agreement that Mrs T entered into in September 2009 ended when the credit was 
settled in July 2015 and her claim under section 140A about her relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance under that agreement and the loan agreement that she 
entered into in November 2015 being unfair was made to Barclays Partner Finance in 
September 2019, less than six years later, so I consider that it would have been fair 
and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to have properly considered those 
claims;
Mrs Ts representative says that the misrepresentations and sales practices adopted 
by the holiday company were unlawful, unconscionable, unreasonable and unfair and 
it described in its September 2019 letter to Barclays Partner Finance the 
misrepresentations that it said had been made by the holiday, including that Mrs T 
and her husband were told in July 2010 that they could rent out their points which 
would help pay for maintenance fees, and that in November 2015: they were told 
they would receive payment when their points were used to sell package holidays 
which would help towards paying maintenance fees; Mrs T was misled into entering 
into a ten year loan for a five year surrender clause and the points were sold to them 
as an investment for them to receive profit from; 
Ive not been provided with all of the documents that Mrs T and her husband would 
have signed in September 2009, August 2010 and November 2015 but Ive carefully 
considered the documents that have been provided;
Mrs Ts representative says that Mrs T and her husband tried to rent out their points 
but werent able to get hold of the salesman on the phone and were then informed 
that he would sort out the rentals but he never did  Ive seen no other evidence to 
show that Mrs T and her husband were told that they would receive a payment for 
their points or that they tried to sell any of their points; 
Mrs T and her husband were provided with a letter by the holiday company in 
November 2015 which said that theyd entered into another purchase agreement to 
buy more holiday club membership points at that time and they would be able to 
surrender their points five years later at no additional cost - Mrs T also entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £13,600 and she agreed 
to make 120 monthly repayments of £183.93 to Barclays Partner Finance;
Ive not been provided with a copy of that purchase agreement but I understand that 
Mrs T and her husband bought more membership points in November 2015 and they 
received confirmation from the holiday company that they would be able to surrender 
their points five years later at no additional cost  I understand that the price of the 
points and surrender confirmation was £13,600, which Mrs T paid using a loan that 
was repayable over ten years but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that they were misled by the holiday company into entering into that purchase 
agreement or that Mrs T was misled into entering into the loan agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that any of the points were 
sold to Mrs T and her husband as an investment or that they were induced into 
buying the points by any misrepresentations made by the holiday company  nor am 
I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company used 
undue influence to persuade them to enter into any of the agreements or that they 
were misled;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs T and her husband 
were unduly pressurised into buying the membership points, that Mrs T was unduly 
pressurised into entering into the credit card and loan agreements or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable or excessively aggressive sales practices against them 
 Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs T complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about those issues until September 2019 and, as theyd entered into agreements in 
September 2009, August 2010 and November 2015, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
if Mrs T and her husband were concerned about the sales practices that had been 
used by the holiday company, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
not to have then bought more membership points from the holiday company; 
Mrs Ts representative says that no proper assessment was done to assess Mrs Ts 
creditworthiness before providing credit and making loans to her and that no 
affordability checks were carried out by the holiday company - Barclays Partner 
Finance hasnt provided any evidence about its assessment of the affordability of the 
credit and loans for Mrs T but she repaid the credit of £8,500 that was provided to her 
in September 2009 by a payment of £8,255.32 in August 2010 and she repaid the 
credit of £7,130 that was provided to her in August 2010  the account statement 
shows that she repaid £7,000 of that amount between March 2011 and May 2012 
and that the outstanding balance of the account was £680.43 in May 2012  the loan 
was then repaid in full in July 2015;
Barclays Partner Finance had provided credit to Mrs T in September 2007 and she 
repaid the loan that she entered into in March 2008 to repay that credit in August 
2010, it provided credit to her again in September 2009 (which she repaid in August 
2010) and it provided more credit to her in August 2010 (which she repaid in July 
2015) and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those loans 
and credit werent affordable for her at the times that they were provided to her;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs T contacted Barclays Partner Finance to ask 
it for information about the affordability assessments that it had conducted until 
September 2019 and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have 
contacted it about any concerns relating to the affordability assessments that it 
conducted for the loans and credit that she had repaid before then;Barclays Partner Finance made a loan of £13,600 to Mrs T in November 2015 and 
she agreed to make 120 monthly repayments to it of £183.93  the account 
statement shows that there have been some issues with her monthly payments but 
Barclays Partner Finances account records show that it contacted her when she 
missed a payment in July 2021 and she said that she forgot to make the payment 
and wasnt experiencing financial difficulties and those records also show that there 
were no arrears on the account in June 2022 - Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that that loan wasnt affordable for Mrs T when it was made to her 
in November 2015;
Mrs Ts representative says that the terms of the contracts have created an unfair 
relationship but Ive not been provided with most of the contractual documents that 
would have been signed by Mrs T and her husband each time that they bought their 
membership points and it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the 
terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
contracts have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs T and her husband and 
I consider it be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the contracts created an unfair relationship between Mrs T and Barclays 
Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Ts relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs T and 
Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mrs Ts claims so I 
cant say that its response to her claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to her claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mrs T for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership points and the other difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mrs T any of the money that she and her husband paid 
for any of the membership points, to pay her any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 June 2023.
