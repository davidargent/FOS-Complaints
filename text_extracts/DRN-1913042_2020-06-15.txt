The complaint
Mrs Z complains that TSB Bank plc changed the date it paid a standing order to cover her 
mortgage payment without notifying her. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB accepts that in September 2018 it incorrectly change the date it paid Mrs Zs
mortgage standing order from the 28th of the month to the 1st. TSB has paid Mrs Z
£250 to apologise and £221 for costs.
TSB cant make changes to Mrs Zs credit file in relation to her mortgage. Only the
mortgage lender can amend the payment information it reports. TSB has written to
Mrs Z with confirmation that from September 2018 her mortgage standing order was
paid late which impacted the payments shown on her credit file. Its up to the
mortgage lender to decide whether to amend Mrs Zs credit file.
I agree that TSB made a mistake when it changed the date it paid Mrs Zs mortgage
standing order. But Im satisfied TSB has tried resolve matters by giving Mrs Z a
letter to use with her lender and in support of her mortgage application.
Im satisfied that TSBs offer of £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused along
with £221 for costs is a fair way to resolve this complaint. As I think TSB has dealt
with Mrs Zs complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint because TSB Bank plc has already paid a 
settlement that is fair and reasonable.
DRN-1913042Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
