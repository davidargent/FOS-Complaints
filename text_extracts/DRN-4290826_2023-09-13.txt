The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his accounts. He says 
this caused him financial problems and impacted his credit score. He wants NatWest to pay 
him compensation for the trouble and upset he suffered. 
What happened
Mr B had a current account with NatWest.
In January 2021, NatWest decided to review Mr Bs account. Following its review, in 
December 2020, NatWest decided to close Mr Bs account and wrote to him to let him know 
he needed to make alternative banking arrangements.
Mr B contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with his account but says 
the bank wouldnt tell him much about why it no longer wanted him as a customer.
Mr B complained to NatWest. He said he hadnt done anything which wouldve caused the 
bank to close his account and had always maintained his account properly. He told the bank 
that the closure meant he wasnt able to pay his bills, receive his wages or buy shopping.  
He also said that his credit file was impacted and dropped significantly. 
NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed Mr Bs account. The bank also 
said it had closed Mr Bs account in line with the terms and conditions. Unhappy with this 
response Mr B brought his complaint to our service. He said that NatWests actions had 
caused him great deal of stress and he wasnt able to sleep. He says NatWest has treated 
him unfairly and wants the bank to provide a proper explanation about why it closed his 
account. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Bs complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had reviewed and closed Mr Bs account. Mr B disagreed. He says 
NatWest treated him unfairly and damaged his credit file. He wants the bank to explain why 
it closed his account and compensation for the trouble and upset the banks actions caused 
him. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mr B, but Id like to reassure him that I have 
considered everything.
Mr B has explained that the closure of his account has caused him a lot of problems and 
upset  especially as he was relying on his account to receive his wages and pay for 
everyday spending. Im sorry that whats happened has caused Mr B trouble and upset. But  
its generally for financial businesses to decide whether or not they want to provide, or to 
continue to provide, banking facilities to any particular customer. Unless theres a very good 
reason to do so, this service wont usually say that they must keep a customer or 
compensate a customer who has had their account closed. 
Ive considered whether NatWest acted fairly in closing Mr Bs account. In doing so, Ive 
looked at the terms and conditions of his account and regulations. The terms and conditions 
outline that the bank can close a customers account with two months notice, and in certain 
circumstances they can close an account with less notice. In this case NatWest closed 
Mr Bs account without the full notice period. For NatWest to act fairly here they needed to 
meet the criteria to apply their terms for immediate closure  and having looked at these 
terms and all the evidence Im satisfied that the bank did. And that it was entitled to close the 
account as its already done. So, I cant say NatWest treated Mr B unfairly when it closed his 
account.
I understand that Mr B wants NatWest to explain the reason it closed his account applied  
and he is upset that when he spoke to the banks he wasnt able to find out much at all about 
why the bank had decided to close his account.  But NatWest is under no obligation to tell 
Mr B the reasons behind the account closure, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say 
its done anything wrong by not giving Mr B this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate 
for me to require it to do so.
I appreciate what Mr B has said about his credit file. Whilst I accept what Mr B says and 
understand his concerns, I havent seen any evidence that NatWest closing his account led 
to Mr B suffering any financial loss or meant he couldnt apply for another account. In fact, I 
note that Mr B was able to open another account quite quicky with another bank.
NatWest reported information about how the account had been managed when it closed 
Mr Bs account. NatWest is under an obligation to report accurate information. Im satisfied 
that is what has happened here. 
I can understand Mr B is concerned that because it was NatWest who closed the account 
and not him the closure may impact his credit file. But Ive not seen any evidence that this is 
the case. Ive also kept in mind that Mr B didnt owe anything when the account was closed. 
So, I think it is unlikely that the closure of this account impacted his credit file.
In summary, its clearly caused Mr B inconvenience when NatWest close his account. So 
understandably hes upset. And I appreciate it must have been a worrying and frustrating 
time for him.  So, I realise she will be disappointed by my decision. But having looked at all 
the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied that NatWest has treated Mr 
B fairly when it closed his account. So, I wont be telling NatWest to do anything else to 
resolve Mr Bs complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision if that I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint 
against National Westminster Bank Plc.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023.
