K821x#15complaint
Mr O complains about the short term loans he took out with Elevate Credit  International 
Limited trading  as Sunny.  Mr O says that Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He says that he 
had a problem  with gambling and he was also in a debt management  plan. He thinks  that 
Sunny shouldve seen all of this and not lent to him. 
background
Mr O took out 19 instalment loans between September 2016  and February  2017.  Some  of 
the information Sunny has given us is shown in the table at the end of this decision.
Sunny has looked  at Mr Os complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it did 
appropriate checks before  approving all 19 loans. And these checks showed that the lending  
was affordable. It says it did see some  adverse information on the credit  reports  it looked at, 
so it approved lower  loan amounts to Mr O because of this.   
One of our adjudicators has looked at what Mr O and Sunny said. He thought Mr Os 
complaint should  be upheld.  He didnt think that Sunny had made  proportionate  checks  for 
any of the lending. This is because Sunnys credit checks  showed that before the lending  Mr 
O had taken out a large amount of other short  term credit. He thought Sunny shouldve 
looked into Mr Os financial situation  further  because of this. 
Sunny didnt do this and he thought  if it had then it wouldnt  have approved  any of the loans. 
This is because he didnt think that Mr O could afford the repayments. And Sunny wouldve 
seen this had it completed  better checks.  
Mr O agreed with our adjudicator. Sunny didnt agree with our adjudicator.  It provided  some 
further information about how it assessed whether the loans were affordable for Mr O. It also 
said that Mr O wasnt  dependent on the loans as he borrowed for less than 12 months in 
total and there were  breaks in the lending. 
So as no agreements been reached  the complaints been passed to me to me to issue  a 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr Os complaint. Having reviewed the evidence  I 
have available, I think Sunny was wrong to have  given Mr O loans 1 to 19. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN34068952Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable manner. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. And the lending shouldnt adversely impact a consumers financial situation. 
The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
So Ive firstly looked at whether Sunny performed proportionate checks.  If I think that the 
checks were proportionate then it usually wouldve been reasonable for it to lend. But if 
Sunny didnt do proportionate  checks,  Ive looked at whether  it wouldve  been  apparent  to it 
that the loan repayments  were affordable had it done better  checks. Sunny should put things 
right if its likely to have  then found that the loan repayments were  unaffordable.  
Sunny said the following about  the checks it did before  lending:  
it explained how it used the information Mr O provided, and the information it 
obtained from credit checks, to determine  if the loans were affordable
it provided the information it obtained from Mr O and the credit  reference agencies
it says it compared  the information  Mr O provided with national statistics  to see it if 
was reasonable
And based on what it saw from this it thought  it reasonable  to lend to Mr O.
why I dont  think Sunnys checks were  proportionate for loans 1 to 19
As our adjudicator outlined, Sunnys credit checks showed that Mr O had taken a significant 
amount of other  short term lending in the months before he started to apply  for the Sunny 
loans. I agree that this was a high enough  amount (over £11,000 in the last six months), for 
Sunny to have thought that Mr O may have been  dependent on short  term lending.  Or that 
he had other, possibly longer term, financial problems. 
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  for Sunny to have carried  out a full review of Mr 
Os finances before approving any of the loans. And Sunny needed to verify  the information  
it received where  possible. This is so it could make sure Mr O was in a position to make the 
repayments sustainably.
I dont think Sunny did this. I cant see that it fully reviewed Mr Os finances at any time. It 
seems to have just relied on the information Mr O provided and the results of its credit  
checks. So I need to think about  what I think Sunny  wouldve seen if it had carried out 
proportionate checks.
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown
Mr O has provided  some  information about his financial  circumstances. This includes a 
recent credit report and his bank  statements. I accept  that this isnt exactly  what  Sunny 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Ref: DRN34068953Firstly I think proportionate  checks wouldve shown Sunny that Mr O was spending  a 
substantial amount on gambling. He was spending over £1,500 a month at the early part of 
the lending. This increased to around £5,000  a month over the mid part of the lending, and 
up to over £10,000 at times when he took out the later loans. 
Mr O seems to have  been supporting this by taking  short term loans with a number of other 
providers, as Sunnys  credit file data shows these amounts  were  significant before he took 
out the Sunny loans. This continued  going  forward, with Mr O borrowing and repaying large 
amounts on a regular  basis.  He could borrow and repay over £3,000 a month at times, and 
sometimes this was nearer to £4,000. And Mr O was also,  at times, taking longer term loans 
for larger amounts.  
Sunny has said that Mr O only borrowed for a short period and there were breaks in the 
lending. There were  some shorter breaks, as shown in my table below, but I dont think 
these are significant. And Mr O was taking these loans and repaying them  very quickly.  He 
ended up taking 19 loans  in the five months  he and Sunny had a lending  relationship.  This is 
a large amount over a short period. I think this was an indication  that Mr O was potentially  in 
financial difficulty. 
I think that Sunny wouldve found  out all of this information  if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think Sunny wouldve seen Mr O wouldnt  have  been  able repay  the loans in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 1 to 19 to Mr O and I think  
hes lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding  Mr Os complaint about  loans 1 to 19. 
what Sunny should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr O, Sunny should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 1 to 19; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Os credit  file about these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold Mr Os complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2019.
