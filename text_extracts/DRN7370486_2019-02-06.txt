K820x#14complaint
Mrs R complains that:
-It was unfair that National Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) made her take out a life 
insurance policy in 1996 before it would give her a mortgage. Mrs R says she didnt 
want or need the insurance, but NatWest made her take it out; and
-NatWest didnt tell Mrs R when  it no longer  required  a life insurance policy  as a 
condition of its lending. Mrs R says shed have cancelled the policy sooner if shed 
known it wasnt a condition of the mortgage  any more. 
Mrs R would like her premiums refunded and compensation from NatWest.
background
In 1996 Mrs R applied  for a mortgage  with NatWest.  She took out a 25 year capital  
repayment mortgage for around Â£65,000.  One of NatWests conditions,  before it would give 
Mrs R the mortgage, was that she needed to arrange a life insurance  policy.   
Mrs R was sold a life insurance policy by a third party broker. 
In 1999 Mrs R took out a further advance. In 2004 Mrs R arranged a new interest rate 
product and explored having her husband  added to the mortgage and further borrowing. In 
2014 Mrs R arranged another interest  rate product. In 2018  Mrs R repaid the mortgage and 
she cancelled her life insurance policy.
When Mrs R repaid  her mortgage in 2018  she was told by NatWest  that she would need to 
separately cancel  any mortgage protection policies that she had running  alongside  the 
mortgage. Mrs R had also spoken  with a friend who told her they didnt think  she should 
have been made to take out the life insurance back in 1996. This led Mrs R to complain 
about why NatWest had made her take out the policy in the first place,  and when it had 
stopped being a requirement or a condition of the loan. Mrs R was also unhappy that 
NatWest had told her shed needed life insurance  in 1996 when shed been single at the 
time.
Mrs R complained to NatWest but it didnt uphold her complaint. Mrs R brought  the matter  to 
us. Our investigator initially  thought that Mrs Rs complaint  was that she had been mis-sold a 
life insurance policy  by NatWest. He later also looked into whether NatWest should  have  told 
Mrs R sooner than it no longer required life insurance to be a condition of mortgage lending.  
Our investigator didnt  think Mrs Rs complaint should be upheld.
Mrs R replied to say, in summary:
-She accepts that the insurance  was a condition of NatWest lending  to her in 1996;
-However, Mrs R is concerned that there  are lots of other customers like her who 
have paid unnecessarily  for life insurance cover they didnt want or need.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN73704862was it unfair  that NatWest  made  Mrs R take out life insurance before it would give her a 
mortgage?
Mrs R was given a mortgage by NatWest in 1996. Ive looked  at the evidence we have 
surrounding the sale of the mortgage  and Ive considered what  was good industry practice at 
the time.  
NatWest has said that it was normal for mortgage  lenders to ask for life insurance before 
granting a mortgage  at the time the mortgage was sold to Mrs R. I agree that this was a 
typical requirement at the time. The risk appetite of mortgage lenders and the regulatory  
environment were both very different to the present day. And it wouldnt  be appropriate for 
me to impose current industry best practice and regulation  to the conditions of a mortgage 
granted 22 years ago. I dont think it was unreasonable that this was a condition  required by 
NatWest at the time.
Ive also carefully considered how clear NatWest was about what  conditions had to be met 
before it would give Mrs R a mortgage.  I think NatWests  paperwork from the time makes it 
very clear that it was a requirement for Mrs R to have life insurance. It also makes  it 
reasonably clear that Mrs R accepts  the mortgages conditions  once  she accepted its 
mortgage offer. 
Im satisfied that if Mrs R wasnt happy with NatWests  conditions she could have applied  for 
a mortgage with another lender. That is assuming shed have been able to find a lender at 
that time that didnt also require life insurance.  And if all other lenders were  asking  for the 
same insurance as a condition, it is hard to argue that NatWest was unreasonable  in asking 
for the same protections to be in place. I think Mrs R was able to decide if NatWests terms, 
as a potential  lender,  were agreeable to her or choose to apply to another  lender instead. 
Mrs R has said that she didnt need life insurance  because she had no need for life 
insurance because  she was single when the mortgage was taken out. NatWest  didnt 
recommend or advise Mrs R to take out a life insurance policy.  It asked for it to be in place 
as a condition  of the loan.  
There has been a great  deal of publicity around  the mis-selling of insurance  products, such  
as payment protection insurance (PPI) in the media. In some  cases,  PPI policies have been  
expensive and have  provided limited levels of cover to consumers. However, I dont consider 
this case to be similar to a complaint about  the mis-sale of a PPI policy.  
NatWest wanted  Mrs R to take out life insurance  before it would agree to a mortgage  loan. 
Im mindful it didnt sell the policy. NatWest  asked for this policy  to be in force to try to reduce  
financial risk, both for Mrs R and for NatWest. Mrs R, or rather the beneficiaries of her 
estate, would have  benefitted from the policy repaying Mrs Rs mortgage loan in full if shed 
died during the mortgage term. And NatWest would have also benefitted from having the 
borrowing repaid  in full if Mrs R died, regardless of movements in property prices. 
Taking out life insurance alongside a mortgage  loan is typically  perceived to be a prudent  
step when taking out a mortgage. The cover primarily protects  Mrs Rs estate in the event of 
her death.  And I dont  think  life insurance  was necessarily  inappropriate  for Mrs R as a single 
person either. It would have protected the value of Mrs Rs estate  for any potential  future  
beneficiaries, even if Mrs R didnt have any beneficiaries in 1996.  Mrs R married  soon after 
taking out the mortgage  so her single  status was only in the short term.
Ref: DRN73704863Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NatWest to ask for life insurance to be taken out as a 
condition of mortgage lending in 1996. It was good  industry practice at the time and Im not 
persuaded that it was clearly to Mrs Rs detriment.
why didnt NatWest  tell Mrs R sooner that it wasnt a condition  of mortgage lending  
anymore?
I appreciate Mrs R feels shes wasted money on life insurance because she didnt need to 
make a claim on the policy. And Mrs Rs said she would have cancelled her life insurance 
policy sooner if shed known it wasnt a condition  of her mortgage  any more.  However,  Ive 
also said that I dont  consider  it was unsuitable for her needs.
The mortgage documentation makes it clear what conditions there  are before NatWest 
would give Mrs R a mortgage.  But it doesnt  say that it will tell Mrs R if any of these 
conditions later change  during  the mortgage term.
I do think there are times that Mrs R and NatWest would likely have discussed her life 
insurance needs over the rest of the mortgage term. For example, in 1999 Mrs R took out a 
further advance. It isnt clear to me whether Mrs R increased the amount of life insurance 
she had to cover this additional  borrowing. But, at any event, I think  this may have prompted 
her to discuss her life insurance arrangements  with NatWest again.  Similarly, in 2004, when 
Mrs R explored  getting her husband added to her mortgage, I think this is a point at which 
she might  have thought  about reviewing her life insurance arrangements. 
Ive thought about whether I think NatWest  had a duty to tell Mrs R that it no longer required 
life insurance. And whether, by not telling Mrs R, it should become responsible for the cost of 
her life insurance. 
Mrs R was responsible for setting  up her life insurance arrangements when her mortgage 
was taken out. NatWest  didnt arrange  this for her - although it asked for proof that a policy  
was set up to satisfy itself the cover was in place. I dont think there was a point after the 
sale of the mortgage, that NatWest became responsible for Mrs Rs life insurance 
arrangements. I think this remained Mrs Rs responsibility. If Mrs R had asked NatWest for 
advice about life protection, then I think that might be different. But, in the wider 
circumstances of this case,  NatWest  didnt sell Mrs R a policy, or recommend  that she take 
out a particular level of cover. And it didnt at any point tell Mrs R when this cover should  be 
reviewed or stopped.  It only reminded Mrs R to cancel linked protection  policies after she 
repaid the mortgage in 2018.
Overall I dont think NatWest had an obligation  to let Mrs R know that what had once been a 
condition of its mortgage lending, was no longer a condition of borrowing. NatWest wasnt 
Mrs Rs insurer  and it hadnt  asked  her to show she had life insurance in place after granting 
the initial mortgage in 1996. Im not aware  that Mrs R ever queried whether she still needed 
to have the cover, although  her mortgage lending was reviewed several  times over the life of 
the mortgage. 
In any event, I dont think  NatWest can be fairly held responsible  for the fact the policy 
remained in force until 2018 when  Mrs R chose  to repay the mortgage. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN73704864Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2019.
