The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) caused him to lose £4,000.
What happened
Mr H visited a branch of NatWest on 26 October 2020 and withdrew £4,000 in cash. He 
drove away in his car with the cash to another location, approximately 20 miles away. When 
he returned to his car after an hour, the cash had been stolen. The police investigated and a 
man was later convicted of theft.
Mr H complained that NatWest had caused the cash to be stolen as he was asked outside 
the branch what his visit entailed. He told the NatWest member of staff that he was to make 
a large cash withdrawal  higher than the ATM limit. And he was certain that the person who 
stole his cash (or an accomplice) overheard the conversation. Mr H said that it wasnt right 
that NatWest should ask him about his business in such an open way  and this placed him 
at risk of robbery. He said that there had been other such instances recently and the branch 
shouldve been more vigilant. He said the police had visited the branch and highlighted its 
shortcomings in processes  and that the police had said he should be refunded the money.
NatWest said that due to the pandemic, new processes were introduced so that customers 
had to queue outside the branch in a socially distanced way  and only a few customers at a 
time could be allowed inside. Staff members were required to ask customers what they were 
looking to carry out  to see if it could be done more easily by phone, online or mobile. This 
was to prevent unnecessary visits to the branch for the protection of customers and staff. So, 
what happened was in line with branch procedures. NatWest said that there were safer 
alternatives to withdrawing large amounts of cash, such as making a direct payment to 
another persons bank account.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest acted reasonably.  Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) instructions at the time were that firms such as NatWest should 
follow government guidelines  this meant encouraging customers to use options other than 
visiting branches to do their business. The branch in question were limiting the number of 
people inside at any one time - in line with government guidance. And so  this meant 
queuing outside the branch; and asking customers what the reason for their branch visit 
was. This was so they could point to using other methods of doing business. He therefore 
felt that NatWest acted reasonably.
Mr H didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I considered here the guidance issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) at the time - 
as this is important. On 4 June 2020, the FCA issued a statement which said We do not 
expect banking services to fully return to normal immediately, and there may be further 
adjustments required depending on the public health situation. Firms need to follow the 
relevant guidance from the government. Consumers should continue to use alternatives to 
branches where possible, for example, online banking
And so  in this context, banks were asked to follow social distancing guidelines  which 
meant limiting numbers of customers in branches at any one time; and encouraging 
customers to use other means of doing their banking. This meant that banks, including 
NatWest  needed to ask customers outside branches what they intended to do. Weve seen 
that across the industry that this is what commonly happened  and NatWest confirmed to 
us that was their practice.
Mr H has argued that NatWests questions of him outside the branch werent anything to do 
with the pandemic and were designed to drive customers away from branches as part of 
their strategy. Mr H says that because of this, the person (who was later convicted of the 
crime) overheard his intention, and so NatWest acted irresponsibly and should bear the loss 
of money.  But as Ive set out, NatWest were following government guidelines here. 
Mr H has also gone on to say that NatWests branch was advised by the police that there 
were several similar instances and they should be especially vigilant. We asked NatWest 
about that and they told us (and we saw a testimony from the branch manager) that wasnt 
the case.
Mr H also said the police had advised NatWest to take action to prevent a repeat of the 
situation. The branch manager said the police suggested installing some fencing to improve 
confidentiality outside of the branch. This had been considered by NatWest but wasnt 
thought to be practical or helpful. Ive considered this point  and this service cant insist on 
NatWest changing the security configuration at a particular branch. But Ive seen that 
NatWest did consider some changes, but ultimately didnt think they would be helpful or 
practical  and thats all we can expect them to do.
Mr H also said the police had said to him that NatWest hadnt acted responsibly and should 
refund his money  but I havent seen any evidence they did. But I think that even if the 
police had said that  it was for NatWest to consider and decide whether they acted 
unreasonably and should therefore refund some, or all, of the money. And in this case, they 
didnt.  
I agree it was very unfortunate that Mr H was subsequently subjected to the loss of his 
money. I cant comment on what happened when the theft later took place  as that was 
dealt with by the police as part of a criminal investigation. My role is to consider whether 
NatWest acted fairly and reasonably and in line with their processes and responsibilities. 
And  for the reasons Ive set out: I think they did in the circumstances of Mr Hs complaint.
And therefore, while I know that Mr H will be disappointed by my decision, Im not going to 
ask NatWest to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2022.
