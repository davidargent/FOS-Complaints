K821x#15complaint
Miss P complains  that Active Securities Limited (trading  as 247Moneybox) should never 
have lent to her.
background
Miss P had 37 loans  from 247Moneybox between December 2013 and April 2018 as shown 
in the loan summary at the end.
247 Moneybox says it checked  Miss Ps credit record  and information  about her income and 
expenditure to assess affordability.  It says that, although it was satisfied  it had carried  out 
appropriate checks, it would offer to write off the outstanding balance of £546.80  as a 
gesture of goodwill. It also says it would be prepared  to remove any negative information 
from Miss Ps credit file.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He was satisfied with the 
checks carried out prior to loan 1, but, based  on the available information about  Miss Ps 
financial circumstances, and her borrowing pattern,  he considered  247Moneybox  should 
have found loans 2 onwards unaffordable. He acknowledged  there  was a ten-month break 
between loans 33 and 34, but, given Miss Ps borrowing history, he didnt find this was 
enough to constitute a break in borrowing
247Moneybox responded to say, in summary,  that it was entitled  to review loan 34 without 
considering Miss Ps previous lending history as the gap in lending was such that it was 
reasonable to assume Miss Ps financial situation  had improved.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN67516642the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that 247Moneybox was required  to 
establish whether  Miss P could sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 2 and 3 would most likely have 
shown that Miss P:
oHad deferred the repayment of loan 1 several times;
oNeeded to make repayments  that were a significant proportion of her income;
oDidnt have enough disposable income  to comfortably afford the scheduled 
repayments.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247Moneyboxs lending history with Miss P, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which 247Moneybox should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ps case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 4. I say this because:
From  loan 4 onwards  Miss P was provided with a new loan within  days/weeks  of 
settling a previous  one. So 247Moneybox ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Miss P was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous 
loan was leaving in her finances  and that Miss Ps indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Miss P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed 247Moneybox. Loan 
37 was taken out over four years  after Miss Ps first. And it was for five times the 
amount. Miss P had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
247Moneybox over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN67516643I think that Miss P lost out because  247Moneybox continued to provide borrowing from loan 
4 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I acknowledge 247Moneybox argues that loans 34 to 37 should be considered as a separate  
loan chain due to the gap in lending, but I cant agree that should  be the case. I say that 
because, in the particular  circumstances  of this case, where Miss P had been borrowing 
consistently for over three years, I dont consider nine months to be a sufficient break  in 
lending for 247Moneybox  to be satisfied her financial circumstances had improved. Indeed,  
had 247Moneybox carried out proportionate  checks for these loans, its likely to have found  
they were unaffordable based  on Miss Ps commitments  to other short-term lenders at the 
time.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 2 onwards and 247Moneybox should put things 
right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Active Securities Limited (trading  as 
247Moneybox) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss P paid on loans 2 to 37;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  on loan 37, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Miss P; 
Remove any negative  information recorded on Miss P about loans 2 to 6;
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 7 onwards should be removed from 
Miss Ps credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Miss P a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks 
for one. If 247Moneybox intends to apply  the refund to reduce any outstanding  capital  
balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 July 2019.
