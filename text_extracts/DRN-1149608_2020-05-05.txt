The complaint
Mr G complains about Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plcs (RSA) settlement of his pet 
insurance premium refund. My references to RSA include its agents.
What happened
Mr G had pet insurance for his dog with RSA as the insurers since 2014. He says in 2016 he 
phoned RSA to cancel the policy but it didnt do so. In 2019 Mr G realised he was still paying 
for the policy. Hed moved address in 2016 so hadnt received the policy documents from 
then onwards when the policy automatically renewed. On 2 June 2016 Mr G had taken out a 
lifetime cover policy for his dog with another insurer and he wanted RSA to refund the 
premiums on its policy as hed been paying for two policies.
RSA said it couldn't find any record that Mr G asked it to cancel the policy in 2016. When 
he provided RSA with evidence that hed taken out the other insurance policy RSA funded 
50% of the premiums he paid it from 2 June 2016 until 22 January 2019 and 100% of the 
premiums from 23 January 2019 until cancellation in 2019. RSA said the 50% refund was 
good industry practice where there was dual insurance and a business had done nothing 
wrong. It said the other insurer should refund Mr G 50% of the premiums on the other policy 
over the same period. 
RSA also paid Mr G Â£60 compensation for his inconvenience caused by its poor service 
around the refund.
Mr G complained to us. He said he did cancel the RSA policy in 2016 and wants a refund of 
all the premiums he paid on RSAs policy from the time he had dual insurance. He also 
said the other insurer refused to give any refund.
Our investigator thought RSA should refund all the premiums Mr G paid it from 2 June 2016, 
when the other insurance started.
RSA disagree and want an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to decide whether RSA acted fairly and reasonably. In doing so I take into account 
industry good practice but also the individual circumstances of a case. In Mr Gs 
circumstances I think it's fair for RSA to refund all the premiums he paid it since 2 June 
2016. I uphold the complaint. Ill explain why.
RSA has no record of Mr G contacting it to cancel the policy in 2016 and Ive seen no 
evidence to support he asked for cancellation. The policy documents and policy annual letter 
detail how the policy will automatically renew unless Mr G cancels. Mr G didnt get the documents after 2016 as hed moved. Theres no evidence he informed RSA about the 
move. So I understand why RSA thinks its done nothing wrong in automatically renewing 
the policy.
But its clear that Mr G understood he had cancelled RSAs policy in 2016. He had lifetime 
cover insurance for his dog with RSA and he took out a lifetime cover policy for his dog with 
a new insurer on 2 June 2016, so he had the same cover through two different policies. I 
dont think he would have taken out the other policy if hed known RSA's policy was 
continuing.
I understand Mr G hasnt made a claim on his other policy since it started in 2016. If Mr G 
had claimed then the other insurer had good reason not to refund any of the premiums hed 
paid it. But even if he hasnt made a claim I think the issue in this case is about who had the 
risk of liability.
If Mr G had cause to make a claim after 2 June 2016 I think he wouldnt have claimed on 
RSAs policy as he understood hed already cancelled the policy. In effect from that date 
RSA wasnt at risk on its policy. All the risk was with the insurer of the one policy Mr G knew 
he had from 2 June 2016, which wasnt RSA. 
Putting things right
In these particular circumstances I think it's fair for RSA to refund to Mr G the remaining 50% 
of premiums he paid it from 2 June 2016 until 22 January 2019.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.
I require Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plc to pay Mr G the remaining 50% of the pet 
insurance policy premiums he paid it from 2 June 2016 until 22 January 2019.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2020.
