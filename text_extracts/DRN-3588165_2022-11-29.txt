The complaint
Mr B complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund to 
him the money that he paid for a timeshare membership. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr B and his partner entered into a membership agreement with a timeshare company in 
June 2012. The membership gave them occupancy rights of an apartment for a specified 
week each year. They traded in an existing timeshare and they agreed to pay a cash price of 
£5,500. They made an advance payment of £800 by credit card and Mr B entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital for a loan of £4,700 to pay the balance to the 
timeshare company. Mr B agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £70.40 to Hitachi 
Capital.
Mr B and his partner have since upgraded their timeshare and Mr Bs loan from Hitachi 
Capital was settled in October 2014. Mr Bs representative made a claim to Hitachi Capital 
under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2020 for repayment of all 
monies paid under the membership agreement and the loan agreement. Hitachi Capital set 
out the reasons that it wasnt upholding Mr Bs claim but he wasnt satisfied with its response 
so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
didnt think that the contractual terms were so problematic as to be unfair or that Mr B had 
agreed to the purchase without knowing something that was important to that decision or 
that Hitachi Capitals conduct fell so short of the standard that could have been reasonably 
expected that it made its relationship with Mr B unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen 
enough to suggest that there were any other relevant considerations that might mean the 
relationship was unfair and that he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion 
that the relationship was unfair.
Mr Bs representative has asked, on his behalf, for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has described the history of Mr B and his partners timeshare purchases and 
says that the membership was misrepresented to Mr B and his partner and that there was a 
breach of contract because the timeshare company has no ownership of the properties that 
it was selling rights in, and it wasnt made clear that the contract was not an investment in 
real estate or that there was no resale or buy-back programme available. It also says that 
the relationship was unfair because Mr B and his partner were invited to a disguised sales 
event, the product was described as an investment, they were advised that they had to enter 
into the loan to fund the purchase, the timeshare company failed to accept no as an 
answer, the contract terms werent provided to them which meant that they had no 
opportunity to cancel the contract, and consideration was accepted from them within the 
cooling off period in violation of section 25 of the Timeshare Holiday Products Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Hitachi Capitals 
response to his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr B and his partner signed the membership agreement in June 2012 and it gave 
them occupancy rights of an apartment for a specified week each year  they also 
signed the general provisions which described their cancellation rights, they signed a 
separate standard withdrawal form to acknowledge receipt of that information and 
they signed an understanding and acceptance statement;
Mr B also signed the loan agreement with Hitachi Capital which included his right to 
withdraw from the loan agreement;
Mr Bs representative says that the timeshare membership was misrepresented to 
Mr B and his partner and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - the latest time that any such misrepresentations could have 
been made to them was in June 2012 as that was when they entered into the 
membership and loan agreements, but they didnt complain to Hitachi Capital about 
the misrepresentations until August 2020  more than eight years later  and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained about any 
misrepresentations before then;
the understanding and acceptance statement that Mr B and his partner signed 
included a declaration that they received no representations other than those set out 
in writing and Im not persuaded that theyve provided enough evidence to show that 
the timeshare membership was misrepresented to them by the timeshare company 
before they entered into the membership agreement;
Mr Bs representative also says that theres been a breach of contract because the 
timeshare company had no ownership of the properties that it was selling rights in  
but the membership agreement gave Mr B and his partner occupancy rights of an 
apartment for a specified week each year and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
that occupancy right wasnt made available to them;
his representative also says that theres been a breach of contract because it wasnt 
made clear that the contract was not an investment in real estate or that there was no 
resale or buy-back programme available  but Ive seen nothing in the membership 
agreement and related documents that would reasonably suggest that the 
membership was an investment and the understanding and acceptance statement 
that Mr B and his partner signed says: We understand that [the timeshare company] 
does not run any resale programmes. However, we do acknowledge that we are free 
to resell our membership privately at any time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the timeshare company;
Mr Bs representative has described the way that the membership and timeshares 
were sold to Mr B and his partner but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that they were unduly pressured into entering into the membership agreement or loan agreement in June 2012 or that the timeshare company used 
unacceptable commercial practices against them  theyve clearly entered into other 
timeshare agreements and, if they were concerned about the way that this timeshare 
was sold to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have had 
concerns about entering into any further agreements;
the membership agreement and loan agreement were signed in June 2012 but 
Mr Bs complaint wasnt made to Hitachi Capital until August 2020  more than eight 
years later - and if he was concerned about the way that those agreements had been 
sold to him I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained 
to Hitachi Capital about any such issues before then;
the membership agreement clearly sets out Mr B and his partners right to cancel the 
agreement within 15 days of the conclusion of the agreement and they both signed a 
separate standard withdrawal form which set out the start date of their withdrawal 
right and said that they had fifteen days from then in which they could withdraw from 
the agreement;
I consider that Mr B and his partner ought reasonably to have known that they were 
able to withdraw from the agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
tried to do so  and I understand that they traded in that membership when they 
upgraded their timeshare in 2014;
the loan agreement also clearly set out Mr Bs right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement without giving any reason within 14 days  he signed the loan agreement 
and immediately above his signature it says: This is a credit agreement regulated by 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its 
terms;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr B to have read the loan 
agreement before he signed it and, if hed done so, he would have been aware of his 
right to withdraw from the loan agreement - but Ive seen no evidence to show that he 
tried to do so and the loan was settled in October 2014;
Mr B and his partner signed the membership agreement in June 2012 and Mr B also 
signed the loan agreement in June 2012  but the loan account statement shows that 
the account wasnt opened until July 2012, after the withdrawal period had ended, so 
Im not persuaded that consideration was accepted from Mr B within the withdrawal 
period or that theres been a breach of the regulations to which his representative 
has referred;
Im not persuaded that Mr B has provided enough evidence to show that his 
relationship with Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr B and Hitachi 
Capital; 
I consider that Hitachi Capitals response to Mr Bs section 140A claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that his representative has described but I find 
that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Hitachi Capital to refund to him 
any of the money that he paid under the membership agreement, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or reject my decision before 27 December 2022.
