The complaint
Mr H complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr H was given 45 loans by Sunny between February 2017 and April 2018. Each of the 
loans was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but Mr H generally repaid the loans 
within at most a few weeks of taking them out. All the loans, apart from the last one, have 
been fully repaid. A summary of the some of Mr H's borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
DRN-1917278expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Mr H.
I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing loans 5 to 7. But Mr H 
hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have 
shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Sunny had been wrong to agree these 
loans.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 8, Sunny should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mr H's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide further loans. 
I asked Sunny to pay Mr H some compensation in relation to loans 8 to 45.
Mr H hasn't provided anything further in response to my provisional decision. Sunny has 
provided us with some additional comments. Although I am only summarising here what 
Sunny has said, I have considered its entire response carefully before writing this decision.
Sunny has noted that the way it looks at complaints has changed since it originally assessed 
Mr H's concerns. But it doesn't agree with my provisional decision. It says that;
The highest amount of credit it granted to Mr H was £400
The amount of interest paid versus capital borrowed was low
Mr H's declared income was verified
The average percentage of Mr H's income that was used to repay the loans was 
8.6% which reduced the potential for any harm
Mr H did not contact Sunny before any of the loans had been agreed to inform it of 
the now alleged financial difficulty and had he done so the firm would have exercised 
forbearance in accordance with its regulatory obligations.
Sunny has however concluded that it might have done more in the later stages of its 
relationship with Mr H. In response to our adjudicator's assessment Sunny offered to refund 
the interest and charges Mr H had paid from loan 17 onwards. It has repeated that offer in 
response to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I remain happy with 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
The additional information Sunny has provided to us fails to address the underlying reasons 
that I think part of Mr H's complaint should be upheld. By loan 8 I don't think the only 
consideration was whether the loans were affordable for Mr H based on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation. 
I think by loan 8 it was the overall pattern of Mr H's borrowing relationship that should have 
led Sunny to conclude he was dependent on its lending. That is not a sustainable basis on 
which to lend to a consumer, and so I still think Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr H 
at that point. Under the relevant regulations it was Sunny's responsibility to identify Mr H's 
dependence - it wasn't for him to make that judgement on behalf of the lender.
So I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr H from loan 8 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay him some compensation. Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr H after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 10 May 2017 (loan 8). So Sunny should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 8 to 44
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 45 and treat any payments
Mr H made towards this loan as payments towards the capital
if reworking Mr Hs loan 45 account as Ive directed results in Mr H effectively having
made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny should refund these
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement.
if reworking Mr Hs loan 45 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then
Sunny can use the total refund for loans 8 to 44 (after the deduction of tax) to offset
this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I remind Sunny that it
should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan
with Mr H
remove all information about loans 8 to 44, and about loan 45 when it is fully repaid,
from Mr Hs credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Hs complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
