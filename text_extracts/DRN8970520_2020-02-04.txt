K821x#15complaint
Mr L says Cash on Go Limited trading as peachy.co.uk (Cash On Go) irresponsibly lent to 
him.
background 
This complaint is about 5 loans Cash On Go provided to Mr L between 6 October 2014 and 
7 October 2015. Mr Ls borrowing history  is as follows:
LoanDate
TakenDate
RepaidInstalments AmountHighest
Repayment
1 06/10/2014 28/10/2014 1 £100.00 £126.00
2 30/11/2014 24/12/2014 1 £200.00 £251.00
3 24/12/2014 27/03/2015 3 £500.00 £346.66
4 13/05/2015 07/10/2015 6 £150.00 £52.87
5 07/10/2015 24/03/2016 6 £220.00 £75.69
Mr L said the lending  was irresponsible; his loans were issued without any reassessment  of 
his income; he adds he struggled to meet normal household bills due to the unaffordable 
lending.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought the loans from loan 3 onwards  
shouldnt have been given. Cash On Go disagreed  with part of our adjudicators view. It said 
it was willing  to uphold  loan 5. But it disagreed that loans 3 and 4 were  made  irresponsibly 
and so the complaint was passed  to me.
Neither party made any comments about  loans 1 and 2, so I wont  need to look at those 
loans in this decision. And as Cash On Go has agreed to uphold  loan 5, I will only be looking 
at loans 3 and 4, although  I will refer to the other loans when looking at Mr Ls 
circumstances.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Cash On Go needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cash on Go should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN89705202the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash  on Go was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 3 and 4 would most likely have 
shown that Mr L was not managing his money  well as he had agreed  to pay a significant 
proportion of his income  to repay  his loans.  So there  was a risk he wouldnt have  been  able 
to meet  his existing  commitments without having  to borrow again. I think  Cash  On Go would  
also have seen that Mr L took out loan 3 on the same day he settled loan 2, and all 3 loans 
at that point were  for steadily increasing  amounts. I dont  think Cash On Go should  have  lent 
to Mr L from loan 3 onwards. 
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3 and 4 and Cash On Go should put things  
right. Cash  On Go has already agreed  to uphold loan 5 in accordance with our adjudicators 
view, so I will also cover  loan 5 when describing how Cash  On Go should put things  right for 
Mr L in the paragraph below. 
putting things right  what Cash  On Go Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 3, 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Ls credit file;
Ref: DRN89705203all entries  about loan 5 should  be removed from Mr Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash On Go Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
Cash On Go Limited must give Mr L a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Cash  On Go Limited  
should put things right for Mr L as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2020.
