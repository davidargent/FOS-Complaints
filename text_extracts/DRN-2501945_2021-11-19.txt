The complaint
Miss B complains about the steps AvantCredit of UK, LLC has taken in redressing her for a 
loan it shouldnt have lent to her.  
What happened
Miss B complained to Avantcredit about two high cost credit loans it sold to her. AvantCredit 
upheld her complaint about the second loan and calculated that she was due redress of 
around Â£320. When Miss B accepted the offer for redress, AvantCredit said because it had 
sold the loan, it contacted the debt purchaser to let it know about the outstanding balance 
reduction.
Miss B has now fully repaid the outstanding amounts to the debt purchaser and has said she 
has been unable to contact the debt purchaser for the refund she is due as it hasnt been 
responding to her emails. 
The complaint was looked at by one of our adjudicators who thought that it was unfair for 
Miss B to have to chase the debt purchaser and she was being denied her due redress. 
AvantCredit didnt agree, it said it was following this services approach by asking the debt 
purchaser to amend the balance and it was ultimately for Miss B to get her redress from the 
purchaser if shed fully repaid the outstanding balance on the loan. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
AvantCredit accepts that it lent a loan to Miss B when it shouldnt have and so it needs to put 
her back in the position, she would have been had she not been lent this loan in the first 
place. If Miss B wasnt lent this loan, she wouldnt have paid the interest, fees and charges 
on the loan and she wouldnt have had to deal with the debt purchaser.
AvantCredit has done something wrong here and I think the burden is on it to make it right. 
AvantCredit chose to sell the loan to a third party, it wasnt required to do this, and it needs 
to take responsibility for that decision. As AvantCredit sold the loan, it no longer owns the 
loan and it cant adjust the balance of a loan it doesnt own.
Also, by the time AvantCredit upheld Miss Bs complaint, shed repaid the loan and so there 
isnt a debt to offset here. Avantcredit cant offset payment for a debt that doesnt exist and 
which it no longer owns. 
I dont think it is enough for AvantCredit to say it has communicated the new loan balance to 
the debt purchaser and it now falls on Miss B to get her refund from the third party. This has 
meant Miss B has continued to be deprived of her money and remains out of pocket. 
AvantCredit needs to put things right.
  
Putting things right
AvantCredit should pay the refund for the loan that shouldnt have been lent directly 
to Miss B. 
It needs to refund overpayments on the capital amount borrowed for the loan and pay 
interest of 8% simple a year on the overpayments from the date they were paid (if 
they were) to the date of settlement;
AvantCredit has said it has taken steps to remove negative entry about the loan from 
Miss Bs credit file.

 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss B a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Miss Bs complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC 
to put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 December 2021.
