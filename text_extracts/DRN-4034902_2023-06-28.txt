The complaint
Mr H complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC trading as Tesco Bank have registered a 
late payment marker on his credit file.
What happened
Mr H says that he phoned Tesco on 9 June 2022 in relation to his credit card statement 
dated 5 June 2022. He says the statement showed a minimum payment of £26 due by 30 
June 2022 and it showed a late fee. During the call Mr H says he asked for the late fee to be 
waived as he made the payment before the due date, but it was only received late due to a 
bank holiday. Mr H says that on the same call he asked if he could change the payment due 
date. He says the call handler told him he could move the payment date to 17th of the month 
starting 17 July 2022. Mr H says before he confirmed the change of date he asked the 
advisor a number of times if there would be a payment due by 30 June 2022, but he says the 
call handler advised him the next payment due would be 17 July 2022.
Mr H says he received a further statement on 22 June 2022 showing a minimum payment 
required of £39 due by 17 June 2022. He says the statement didnt mention that a previous 
payment was due by an earlier date, nor did he receive any other correspondence to inform 
him that any payment was due before 17 July 2022. Mr H says he checked the Tesco 
application (app) before 30 June 2022, and it said his payment was due by 17 July 2022. But 
Mr H says he received an email from Tesco early July 2022 to inform him he had not made a 
payment. Mr H says he immediately made a payment which reached Tesco on 5 July 2022, 
but his credit score had been affected. Mr H made a complaint to Tesco.
Tesco partially upheld Mr Hs complaint. They said as a gesture of goodwill, they had 
refunded the late payment fee and associated interest due to the missed payment because 
of the bank holiday. Tesco said on the call, they informed him that as the statement dated 5 
June 2022 had already been produced, then a payment would be required on 20 June and 
the new date would be on the next statement. They said with regard to the mobile app 
showing the payment required for 17 July 2022, this is the details for the current statement, 
however the full statement will show that the £39.00 payment required included the overdue 
payment of £26.00 for the previous statement. Tesco said they credited Mr Hs account with 
£25 due to him not getting a call back as promised. Mr H brought his complaint to our 
service.
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Hs complaint. He said from the phone call he listened to, 
the call handler told Mr H that for the current month the payment would be needed by 30 
June 2022, before changing the monthly repayment date from July onwards. He said 
considering this, Mr H was made aware that he needed to make a payment by this date, but 
he didnt make a payment by this date. 
Mr H asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint. He said the statement dated 22 June 
2022 was generated a number of days after the statement date change request and it does 
not mention any reference to a payment required by 30 June 2022. He said the minimum 
payment due by 17 July 2022 included the minimum payment for the six week period as the 
payment was changed to the middle of the month. He said the app was updated to reflect 
the minimum payment was due by 17 July, so all sources available to him before 30 June 
pointed to the payment being due by 17 July 2022. Mr H says as the payment was made on 
5 July 2022, approximately two weeks before the due date, then the late payment marker 
should be removed from his credit file.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H has made a number of points to this service and Ive considered and read everything 
hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body Ill be 
focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
Ive listened to the phone call that Mr H had on 9 June 2022 with Tesco. He asks for the due 
date to be changed. The call handler asks is the 16th of the month okay? and Mr H replies 
yeah, that would be fine. The call handler says for this month (June 2022), as your 
statement is already produced, its still gonna remain the 30th, but you are gonna make a 
payment, err, err, youll have to make a payment before 20th June for this thing, right? and 
Mr H replies right, okay, yeah and then the call handler says your other due date will come 
into effect from your next statement when its produced, is that okay? Mr H says yeah. He 
asks if he would still have a notification two days before the 16th now, so on the 14th that 
its due? and the call handler confirms it should be two days before 16th that he would 
receive this. She confirms the new statements will be dated 22nd of the month and she 
arranges the refund of the £12 late fee and the interest for this, and the call concludes.
Mr H was told he would need to make a payment before 20 June 2022. But based on the call 
handlers accent, its possible that she did say 30 June but on the balance of probabilities Im 
persuaded she said 20 June. I say this as the new statement was being produced on 22 
June as confirmed by the call handler that his new statements would be dated from 22nd of 
the month, therefore if he didnt make a payment before his next statement then in all 
likelihood this would count as a missed/late payment. 
But despite Mr H saying right, okay, yeah, his statements do not show him making a 
payment before either 20 or 30 June 2022, so I cant give him the benefit of the doubt if there 
was any confusion about whether he needed to pay by 20 or 30 June because his next 
payment was made in July. Mr H had previously been informed on his 5 June 2022 
statement that he needed to pay at least the minimum payment due of £26 by 30 June 2022. 
The call handler clearly told him that his other due date will come into effect from (his) next 
statement when its produced and that is what happened. When his next statement was 
produced, this was on 22 June 2022, and it showed the payment due date of 17 July.
So Im persuaded that the only reason the higher payment is included in the 22 June 2022 
statement is because he didnt pay the £26 by 20 June 2022. If Mr H was in any doubt of 
whether the call handler meant 20 or 30 June 2022, or if he did not understand what he 
needed to pay and when, then it would have been proportionate to ask the call handler to 
repeat these dates or set out what he needs to do by what date. But instead, he agreed with 
the call handler. 
Tesco are required to provide accurate information to the Credit Reference Agencies, so if 
they have reported any late payments here, Im not persuaded that they have done anything 
wrong by doing this when Mr H didnt make a payment in June 2022. As the app would show 
the current statement details, this is why it would be showing as a payment due date of 17 
July 2022 if Mr H had looked at the app from 22 June 2022. Tesco credited his account with 
£25 for a lack of a call back after he was promised one and Im persuaded this is reasonable compensation for the impact this is likely to have had on him, so it follows I dont require 
Tesco to do anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2023.
