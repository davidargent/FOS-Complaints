The complaint
Mrs C complains that NewDay Ltd unfairly registered a default on her credit file. She says 
shes been unable to get a mortgage as a result.
What happened
In January 2018, Mrs C contacted NewDay about some transactions on her credit card. She 
said she had been told she was eligible for a free phone and had paid £3 for processing / 
delivery. She wasnt aware that she would be charged a monthly subscription with an online 
game service.
 
NewDay said it would place a stop on future transactions and advised Mrs C to contact the 
merchant to request a refund. Mrs C called NewDay back the same day and said she was 
expecting £73 to be refunded from the merchant.
In March 2018, Mrs C contacted NewDay about a late payment fee that had been applied to 
the account. It removed the fee as a gesture of goodwill. NewDay says it told Mrs C that she 
would need to chase a refund from the merchant as transactions on the account were made 
before they were put on the stop list.
NewDay says there was no further contact from Mrs C until May 2022 and she hadnt made 
any payments in the meantime. Her account remained in arrears, and interest and charges 
had been added. Mrs Cs account had been terminated and a default was registered with the 
credit reference agencies, prior to it being sold to a debt collection agency in November 
2018.
Mrs C raised a complaint with NewDay. She said she had cancelled the subscription from 
the beginning. She had asked NewDay to cancel and stop payments. She was concerned 
that NewDay might have paid again after shed instructed it not to. She said that as a result 
of the default NewDay had placed on her credit file, she couldnt get a mortgage. 
NewDay said it had acted in line with its terms and conditions when it passed her account to 
a debt collection agency and applied the default to her credit file. It acknowledged there had 
been some poor customer service, so it refunded the interest and fees on the account as a 
gesture of goodwill. However, NewDay said it was unable to remove the default from Mrs Cs 
credit file as it was obliged to report factually correct information.
Mrs C remained unhappy, so she asked our service to consider her complaint. Our 
investigator looked into her concerns, but she didnt think Mrs Cs complaint should be 
upheld. Our investigator thought it was fair for NewDay to have applied the default to Mrs Cs 
credit file.
Mrs C disagreed with our investigators outcome. She asked why NewDay had still paid the 
merchant after shed told it that it was a scam and why she still owed £73. She said that she 
couldnt remember receiving any letters or statements from NewDay since she moved home 
in February 2018. She said her mortgage applications had been declined because NewDay 
had given her a bad credit record. So, her complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Cs complaint. Ill explain why.
NewDay has a responsibility to treat its customers fairly and communicate with them in a 
way which is clear, fair and not misleading. 
According to NewDays records, Mrs C called it in January 2018, regarding transactions of 
£3 and £70, that had been charged to her credit card in December 2017. NewDay has noted 
providing Mrs C with the merchants contact details and adding the merchant to a stop list. 
I appreciate Mrs C feels that NewDay should have refunded the payments to her account 
when she first disputed the transactions. However, chargebacks arent guaranteed to be 
successful and a card issuer would normally want to see that the cardholder has tried to sort 
things out with the merchant before attempting one. So, I think it was reasonable for 
NewDay to have directed Mrs C to the merchant.
NewDay has noted that Mrs C called back the same day to let it know she was expecting a 
refund of £73 from the merchant.
NewDay says that when Mrs C called it again in February 2018, to say she had not yet 
received the refund, she was told to contact the merchant via email so they could confirm the 
refund. NewDay says it advised Mrs C it could raise a chargeback dispute if the merchant 
debits the account after it had been added to the stop list or it had promised a refund and not 
actioned it. I can see from the information Mrs C provided, that she emailed the merchant 
the following day. In response, the merchant told her it had already processed a refund of 
£70. 
Mrs C contacted NewDay again in March 2018 after a late payment fee had been charged to 
her account. NewDay refunded the late payment fee as a gesture of goodwill. NewDay says 
it told Mrs C that she would need to chase her refund with the merchant as transactions 
were made before it was put on a stop list.
Mrs C has raised concerns that NewDay allowed the transaction of 19 January 2018 to go 
through. However, NewDay didnt place the merchant on the stop list until 22 January 2018, 
which is the date its noted Mrs C calling. Mrs C says she contacted NewDay sooner than 
this, but theres no indication of this in NewDays notes and I havent seen any other 
evidence to persuade me that NewDay should have placed the merchant on the stop list 
sooner. 
Mrs C has commented that NewDay didnt inform her of the £70 the merchant refunded in 
May 2018. However, this is showing on her June 2018 credit card statement. So, Im 
satisfied NewDay did share this information with Mrs C.
Although the merchant eventually refunded £70 to Mrs Cs credit card, this wasnt enough to 
cover all of the transactions it had charged. The merchant had charged Mrs C a total of £143 
in three transactions. This is why a balance of £73 remained on Mrs Cs account, even after 
NewDay refunded all of the fees and interest that had been applied to it.
After the call of March 2018, Mrs C doesnt appear to have contacted NewDay again until 
May 2022. And, from what I can see, she didnt make any further payments to her account 
during this time. Mrs C was required to make a minimum payment each month, while there was an outstanding balance on the account. So, her credit card statements show that her 
account was in arrears in the months that followed.  Mrs C was also sent a number of 
notices of default and notices of sums in arrears.
In October 2018, NewDay sent Mrs C a letter informing her that it intended to register a 
default with credit reference agencies, unless she brought her arrears up to date within the 
next 28 days. The letter said: The default will stay on your file for six years and may make it 
harder for you to get credit in the future.
There doesnt appear to have been any payment or contact from Mrs C. So, the default was 
registered in late November 2018.
Mrs C says she cant remember receiving any letters or statements from NewDay since she 
moved home in February 2018. However, everything that was sent to Mrs C since April 
2018, is addressed to where she says she moved to. 
I note there is a small spelling error in the first line of the address. However, the house/flat 
number and post code are correct. So, on balance, I think NewDays correspondence is 
likely to have been delivered to her. In any event, Mrs C was responsible for managing her 
account. So, I would have expected her to contact NewDay if she wasnt receiving her 
statements, particularly as the issue regarding the refund remained outstanding.
Im satisfied that NewDay gave Mrs C clear information about the status of her account and 
what would happen if she failed to bring it up to date. It also sent her a number of letters 
asking her to contact it, but Mrs C didnt do so. So, I think it was fair for NewDay to have 
registered the default with the credit reference agencies, when it did. 
I understand Mrs C had some difficulty speaking to NewDay in May 2022. She was waiting a 
long time for her call to answered and wasnt called back as promised. However, NewDay 
refunded interest and fees on the account, totalling £102. I think this is reasonable 
compensation for the customer service issues she experienced. So, I dont require NewDay 
to do anything further. 
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mrs C, but overall, I think NewDay has acted 
fairly and reasonably.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
