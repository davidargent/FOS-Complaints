The complaint
Mrs M, through a representative complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) provided loans 
to her which she couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
Mrs M was advanced 7 home collected loans (which there is information for) between July 
2014 and May 2018. Ive included some of the information weve received about these loans 
in the table below.

The weekly repayment column in the table above is the cost per week per loan. Where 
loans overlapped the cost per week was increased, for example when loans 1 and 2 were 
running at the same time Mrs Ms weekly commitment was £48. 
Loans 1 and 2 in the table above were provided by a different company than Morses. 
Morses purchased the loan book of the other company in May 2015 and as part of that 
purchase it agreed to take on responsibility for any loans that were outstanding at that time. 
We also know, that prior to the loans in the table above Mrs M had up to 34 previous loans. 
But neither party is able to provide any information about these earlier loans so I cant put 
the loans that Morses is responsible for into any sort of context. 
Following Mrs Ms complaint Morses wrote to her representative to explain that it wasnt 
going to uphold her complaint. Mrs Ms representative didnt agree with the outcome and 
referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. 
An adjudicator reviewed the complaint. He explained that Morses didnt any information 
about Mrs Ms income and expenditure for the earlier loans and there was also a 13-month 
gap in lending (highlighted in the table above). Taking everything into account, he didnt think 
there was anything in the information provided which wouldve shown Morses the loans were 
either unaffordable or unstainable. 
Morses didnt respond to or acknowledge the adjudicators assessment. 
Mrs Ms representative didnt agree with the findings. It said:
We have spoke (sic) with our client and they do not accept this offer of not upholding any 
of the case please can you ask the Ombudsman to look at this case for a final review.
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me to resolve.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mrs M could afford to pay back the amounts 
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Mrs Ms 
income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks 
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs M. These factors include:
Mrs M having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mrs M having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs M coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs M.
Morses was required to establish whether Mrs M could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs M was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Loans 1  3
Due to how old these loans are Morses cant say what information was collected from Mrs M 
before these loans were approved. Also, Mrs M hasnt provided any information about her circumstances at the time. So, I dont know really anything about her circumstances at the 
time.
In addition, as Ive said above, I dont know how these loans fitted into the context of the 
overall lending relationship up to this point in time. 
I accept these loans led to Mrs M having a not insignificant weekly credit commitment to 
Morses, which, may have been unaffordable or unsustainable for Mrs M. But as neither party 
has been able to supply any information about these earlier loans I cant fairly conclude that 
Morses made unreasonable lending decisions. 
Im therefore not upholding Mrs Ms complaint about these loans. 
Loans 4  7
There was a gap in lending of around 13 months between loan 3 being repaid and loan 4 
being advanced. In my view, this gap was long enough for Morses to have treated Mrs Ms 
application afresh. This has implications for the level of checks Morses may have been 
expected to carry out. In short, loan 4, becomes loan 1, in a new chain of lending. 
For these loans Mrs M declared she had an income of at least £440 per week. She also 
declared her weekly expenditure was between £234 and £269 per week. Mrs Ms disposable 
income was sufficient to be able to afford the largest weekly repayment due to Morses of 
£46.50. 
Given it was still quite early on in this lending relationship and there didnt appear to have 
been any repayment problems when Mrs M repaid her loans, I think it was reasonable for 
Morses to have relied on the information Mrs M provided which showed the loan repayments 
were affordable. 
Ive also thought about the fact that some of these loans overlapped but even taking into 
account the higher weekly repayments as a result of this the loans still looked affordable. So, 
this doesnt change my mind about the checks that Morses carried out. 
Finally, there wasnt anything else that was apparent to Morses which may have made it 
realise these loans were unsustainable for Mrs M. 
As this is the case, Im not upholding Mrs Ms complaint about loans 4  7 and therefore, Im 
not upholding Mrs Ms complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im not upholding Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
