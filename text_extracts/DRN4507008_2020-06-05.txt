K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Morses  Club PLC lent to him irresponsibly. He says he has health conditions  that 
compel him to make purchases. This led to him taking loans that he couldnt  afford  to repay.  
He also says his father  informed Morses about this, but it still continued to lend. 
background
Mr T has, in total, complained about 33 home  collected credit loans. Morses says it 
purchased some loans  that Mr T had taken from Shopacheck Financial Services up to 2011. 
It did this in March 2014.  These are loans 1 to 14. These are being  considered  separately so 
they wont be looked at as part of this complaint. 
Mr T continued to borrow and he took loans 15 to 22 from Morses between November 2011 
and August 2012. Ive listed some of the information I have about these below:

Morses has said that it didnt follow its own internal procedures  in respect of loans 23 to 33. 
So it has upheld these  loans  and offered compensation in the same  way that I would were I 
to uphold a complaint about this lending.  
Morses didnt agree to this Service considering loans 15 to 22 due to the time Mr T took to 
make his complaint.  I have decided that this Service does have  jurisdiction to consider this 
lending in a separate decision. 
Our adjudicator has upheld the complaint about loans 15 to 22. Morses  disagreed  with the 
adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
Ref: DRN45070082These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Morses  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint. Ive decided to uphold  Mr Ts complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
As I said above, loans  1 to 14 are being  considered  as part of a separate complaint. 
But they were part of Mr Ts home credit lending history. And I think,  given what  I know 
about Mr Ts circumstances  that Morses  was, or shouldve  been, aware of this lending.  So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took. 
And Morses  has already  offered  to pay compensation  about loans 23 to 33. So I wont  be 
making a decision  about this period of lending. But Ive included the compensation for loans 
22 to 33 in the putting things right section of my decision. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 15 to 22. And I 
havent looked at the issues Mr T has raised about how the loans were  sold in relation  to his 
health problems.  This is because  I dont think its necessary to do so. Ive looked at the 
overall pattern  of Mr Ts lending history with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  
Morses should  reasonably have  seen that further  lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise 
harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  
loans. 
Ref: DRN45070083Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was already  reached 
by loan 15. I say this because:
At this point Morses  ought to have realised  Mr T was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had already taken  out 14 loans over almost a two year period. And 
I understand Morses  was aware  of this. So Morses ought to have realised  it was 
more likely than not that Mr Ts indebtedness  was unsustainable.
Mr Ts had taken  his first home credit loan in early 2010. So at loan 15, which  was 
almost two years later, Morses ought to have known  that Mr T was not likely 
borrowing over a shorter term but he had an ongoing, long term, need. 
From  loan 15 onwards  Mr T was provided  with a new loan without a break  in lending. 
And Mr T went  on to often use the new loan to repay the outstanding balance on his 
previous lending. 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Morses.  And this 
continued for some time going forward.  Mr T had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Morses  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Morses continued  to provide borrowing from loan 15 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Im upholding the complaint about loans  15 to 22. And I think the compensation Morses  has 
offered for loans  23 to 33 is fair and reasonable. Morses should put things right as Ive 
outlined below.
putting things right  what Morses  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  15 to 33;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from 15 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  15 to 33 should be removed from Mr Ts 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses  to take off tax from this interest. Morses must  
give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint.
Morses Club PLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before (date).
