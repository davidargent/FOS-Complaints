K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains about the service he has received from National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
concerning his credit card account. 
background
In January 2018, Mr A telephoned NatWest  to say he didnt recognise  a direct debit payment 
leaving his account  to go to a NatWest  account.  NatWest could not find Mr As account from 
the details he provided  so he was told to cancel the direct debit as it appeared he did not 
have an account  with it.
But Mr A did hold an account  NatWest hadnt  been provided with his new address and so 
the adviser had been looking for an account  with the new address rather than the old one.
As a result of the cancelled direct  debit, Mr As account went  into arrears and was closed. A 
default notice  was sent out to him at his previous address.
When Mr A complained, NatWest did not uphold his complaint.   It said it was Mr As 
responsibility to update  his address.  It also reminded him about  a complaint he had made  in 
January 2016  when  the same direct  debit had been  cancelled by NatWest.   Mr A had reset 
the payment at this time. So, NatWest  said he must  have known which  account he was 
paying for.  It demanded the outstanding  balance  in full  or for Mr A to arrange  a repayment 
plan.
But Mr A wasnt  happy  with that response.  He wanted to continue to pay the minimum 
payment on the account.  So, he came to this service.  He also told this service that two men 
had come to his property   purporting to be bailiffs on behalf of NatWest.   They had 
demanded payment of the outstanding  sum and Mr A had paid them.
Our investigator didnt  think he could  ask NatWest to do anymore and he explained to Mr A 
he didnt think the bailiffs had been  sent on behalf of NatWest.   He thought they were  
fraudsters.
The matter  was then passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
call in January 2018
NatWest no longer have  this call where Mr A queries the payment to an account.  But  its 
clear at this stage that Mr A had not yet updated his address with NatWest.  This  was his 
responsibility. Its also clear from a complaint Mr A made in 2016  that he knew  of this 
account because  he had already reset the payments on it. I also remind myself that this 
account had been open since 2010.
Ref: DRN36027212Itss difficult to know  what exactly was said during the call  but on balance, Im satisfied 
NatWest did nothing wrong in not being  able to find Mr As account.
default
NatWest sent this notice  to the last known  address  it had for Mr A.  This was his old address 
but in the circumstances,  I think it was fair and reasonable to do this.  
demand for payment/arrangement of repayment  plan
Once the account has been defaulted,  I accept  the balance becomes payable  in full unless  a 
repayment plan can be put in place.   I dont think NatWest did anything  wrong in asking Mr A 
to come to an agreement with it  but I note that as late as February 2019, NatWest  was 
writing to Mr A with his statements and requesting  a minimum payment.  This clearly  caused 
some confusion for Mr A and I have asked NatWest  about this.  I received no response to 
my query.
That said,  I can also see Mr A continued to make payments to the account - so the balance  
was being reduced.
The current  situation  is that the debt remains outstanding and Mr A needs to contact 
NatWest and arrange a repayment plan.  I would remind  NatWest  it needs to treat Mr A 
positively and sympathetically in coming to an agreement as to how much can be paid on a 
monthly basis.
debt being sold on
NatWest told this service it had kept Mr As debt inhouse.  But that wasnt right because  I 
have seen two separate  letters from two separate debt recovery  agents  suggesting  they 
have been instructed by NatWest.  In fact, NatWest wrote to Mr A itself on two separate 
occasions to say the debt had been sold on.  
I asked NatWest why the information given to this service  was conflicting - but I received no 
response.
bailiffs
Unfortunately, whilst the debt may have been  sold onto a third party  (or parties), there is no 
evidence to suggest that the people who came to Mr As address were instructed by 
NatWest or one of its agents.
So, I accept the responsibility of updating  his address fell to Mr A.  I also accept its likely this 
situation arose from him not doing that.  However,  I dont think  NatWest was fair and 
reasonable in how it dealt  with his complaint.
I asked NatWest to comment on aspects of Mr As complaint and it failed to respond in the 
time given  or seek an extension.  I also advised  I would  be making an award for the poor 
service Mr A had received.  Again, it did not respond.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part.
Ref: DRN36027213For the poor service Mr A received, National Westminster Bank Plc must pay him Â£150.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2020.
