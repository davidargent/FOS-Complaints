The complaint
Mr H says Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about seven of the ten instalment loans Lending Stream provided to Mr H 
between December 2015 and October 2018. All the loans were repayable in six monthly 
instalments. 
This is a summary of Mr Hs lending history.

Mr H says he was taking out one high-cost loan to repay another during a time when he was 
struggling financially. These loans made his situation worse. After Mr H complained to 
Lending Stream it upheld his complaint about loans 8 to 10 saying whilst it maintained they 
were affordable, it ought to have considered the number and frequency of the loans hed 
taken out by then. It explained the refund (calculated in line with this services guidelines) 
would be used to offset the amount he still owed, reducing his outstanding balance to 
£356.94. 
Unhappy with this outcome Mr H brough his complaint to this service. The adjudicator didnt 
find that he could conclude Lending Stream had given loans 1 to 7 irresponsibly. Mr H 
disagreed and sent in a list of other high-cost loans he had at the same time. So the 
complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to
establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. As there was a significant gap between 
loans 1 and 2 and loans 2 and 3, I have looked at loans 1 and 2 as standalone loans and am 
treating loan 3 as the start of a chain of lending. As the lender upheld Mr Ls complaint 
relation to loans 8 to 10 I will focus here on loans 1 to 7.
Lending Stream has told us about the checks it carried out for each loan and shared some of
the results. It asked Mr H for details of his monthly income and expenditure. It checked the
expenditure he gave against external data sources and increased his declared outgoings 
where necessary. It also carried out a credit check for each loan. I would say here, by way of 
explanation for Mr H as he sent in a list of other lending he had when he applied, that whilst 
Lending Stream completed credit checks at the time of each application the information it 
saw wont have been exactly the same as what Mr H could have seen on his full credit file. It 
may only have seen part of the file, and some data may be missing, summarised or not up to 
date. And Lending Stream could only fairly make its decisions based on the information it 
had available at the time from the credit reference agencies.
Overall, I think Lending Stream completed proportionate checks for loans 1 to 5. And I dontthink there was anything in the information it gathered, that I have seen, that should have led
it to make different lending decisions. Its assessments showed Mr L would have sufficient 
disposable income to sustainably repay each loan, at no stage would his monthly 
repayments (even when cumulative) exceed 10% of his declared monthly income, and his 
credit checks did not show he was heavily indebted. The checks for loan 2 and 3 showed he 
had one historic default registered against him, but it was over 40 months prior. So I dont 
think it was an indicator that Mr L would be unable to sustainably repay his loans.
It follows I dont think Lending Stream was wrong to give loans 1 to 5 to Mr H.
Like our adjudicator, I think Lending Stream should have completed fuller financial reviews
from loan 6 onwards. We asked Mr H, through his representative, for copies of his bank 
statements so we could look at what such reviews might have shown Lending
Stream. But he didnt provide them. So I cant know what better checks would have shown
Lending Stream.
This means I cant fairly conclude it made the wrong lending decisions for loans 6 to 8.
It follows I am not upholding this complaint. 
Our adjudicator set out in his assessment that he agreed with Lending Streams finding on 
loans 8 to 10, and with how it proposed to settle the loans. Lending Stream replied to the 
assessment and did not challenge this position. So as this concludes this services 
investigation into Mr Hs complaint, Lending Stream should now adjust his outstanding 
balance as it offered to in its final response letter. 
My final decision
I am not upholding Mr Hs complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2022.
