The complaint
Mr F complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund to 
him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership points. His wife is also 
involved in his complaint and hes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr F and his wife had bought 7,000 holiday club membership points rights from a holiday 
company in November 2013 and they entered into a purchase agreement in February 2016 
to buy 8,000 more membership points rights from the holiday company. The total price 
payable for the additional points rights was £8,000 and Mr F also entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Hitachi Capital for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £124.06 to Hitachi Capital. The loan was repaid in January 2021.
Mr Fs representative made claims, on behalf of Mr F, to Hitachi Capital under sections 75 
and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in December 2021. It said that the holiday 
company was in breach of contract, Hitachi Capital was liable for procuring a breach of 
fiduciary duty and the purchase agreement and the loan agreement are unfair. It also said 
that the points rights were misrepresented to Mr F and his wife, the holiday company was in 
breach of the EU timeshare directive and Hitachi Capital failed to carry out a sound and 
proper credit assessment.
Hitachi Capital didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a complaint was 
made to this service. Mr Fs complaint form says that the holiday company and Hitachi 
Capital failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; Hitachi Capital 
paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him and the holiday 
company unduly pressured him and his wife into entering into the purchase agreement and 
him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant 
to section 140A. Hitachi Capital then provided a detailed response to Mr Fs claims in which 
it set out the reasons that it was unable to uphold them. It also says that Mr F and his wife 
bought another 7,500 membership points rights from the holiday company in April 2016.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Fs complaint should be upheld as she didnt think 
that Hitachi Capitals decision to turn down his claims was unfair or unreasonable. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think 
that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough 
to suggest that the relationship between Mr F and Hitachi Capital was unfair and she wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also 
said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable 
for Mr F. She didnt consider that Hitachi Capital had acted incorrectly in connection with any 
commission paid to the holiday company and she didnt think that the purchase agreement 
or the loan agreement was voidable.
Mr F says that hes not in agreement with our investigators recommendation. He says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
he and his wife were told that it was an investment, kept paying for it but werent 
benefiting from the investment and were unable to book holidays;
they were told that if they were unable to use their points they could offer them to 
others but that never materialised; 
there was a lot of high pressure from the holiday company to purchase more points; 
and
there was no fairness and he ended up paying interest which could have been 
avoided.
Mr Fs representative says that it doesnt accept our investigators recommendation and it 
requested that the complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman. It has provided a generic 
submission from a legal counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses. 
It has also raised concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr F and says that the 
holiday company didnt broker proper credit and failed to meet the standard of a regulated 
firm.
Mr F has also made complaints to this service about the finance providers responses to the 
claims that hed made to them about his and his wifes November 2013 and April 2016 
purchases of membership points rights from the holiday company. Those complaints are 
being dealt with separately.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Fs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr F and his wife signed the purchase agreement in February 2016 to buy 8,000 
more holiday club membership points rights from the holiday company which 
increased their number of points rights to 15,000;
they also signed other documents at that time, including the terms and conditions, a 
key information document, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given to withdraw from the purchase agreement and a customer compliance 
statement, and Mr F signed the loan agreement;
Mr Fs representative made claims to Hitachi Capital in December 2021 and Mr F 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the 8,000 points rights were misrepresented to 
Mr F and his wife, but his complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A 
and doesnt refer to misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Fs claims under sections 75 and 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Hitachi Capitals 
response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;the December 2021 letter says the points were misrepresented to Mr F and his wife 
because they were advised that they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental 
income which would cover the maintenance fees and provide a profit but theyve 
never made any profit on the product and they believed that they would be buying 
into an exclusive membership but almost all of the properties can be accessed and 
booked by non-members;
neither Mr F nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mr F and his 
wife before their February 2016 purchase; 
the customer compliance statement that they both signed in February 2016 says: 
We understand that [the holiday company] operates a Rental Programme and that to 
participate, we a must ask the Travel Club to convert our Points into a week which 
will then be placed in the Programme. Whilst there is no guarantee that the week will 
be rented out, if it is we can currently expect to be paid up to £100 / €130 per 1000 
Points (less 15% commission plus vat). It is our responsibility to contact the Travel 
Club to ascertain if the week has been rented out ;
it also says: We understand that there is currently no resale or buyback programme 
for our Points and that you therefore cannot assist us in selling our Points; and: We 
understand that the purchase of our Points is an investment in our future holidays, 
but that it should not be regarded as a property or financial investment and that any 
subsequent resale will depend on market conditions;
Ive seen no evidence to support Mr Fs claim that he and his wife were advised that 
they would receive a guaranteed yearly rental income which would cover the 
maintenance fees and provide a profit or that the points rights were an investment so 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to them that they would receive such an income or make a profit or that 
the points rights were an investment;
the holiday company says that Mr F hasnt made any enquiries to it about offering 
any membership points rights that he and his wife were unable to use for sale and 
Ive seen no evidence to show the holiday company misrepresented to them that 
theyd been able to sell any points rights that they were unable to use;
Im seen no reference in the purchase agreement, the terms and conditions, the key 
information document or the customer compliance statement to the membership 
points rights giving them an exclusive membership or exclusive access to holiday 
properties and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
holiday company told them that they were buying into an exclusive membership or 
that it was reasonable for them to believe that the membership was exclusive;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the points rights were 
misrepresented to Mr F and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the December 2021 letter also says that Mr F and his wifes membership would 
continue for another 37 years (and potentially in perpetuity) and that they had no 
control of the sums incurred by and/or charged under the contract and those terms 
are unfair terms pursuant to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 
1999 and the contract in its entirety is unenforceable;
it also says that Mr F and his wife werent provided with notice of the holiday 
companys general meeting for any year after 2010, so they were not given the 
opportunity of attending and speaking at the meeting, and that is a breach of the holiday companys articles of association and is a breach of contract by the holiday 
company for the purposes of section 75;
the key information document that was signed by both Mr F and his wife in February 
2016 says:  your membership of the  Collection will last until 31st December 
2054. On that date, the  Collection will be dissolved and your membership will 
terminate; so Im not persuaded that the membership would last in perpetuity;
the terms and conditions that were signed by Mr F and his wife in February 2016 say: 
You agree to pay annual Management Charges, which are described at Article 13 of 
the Articles of Association of the  Collection and in the Management Agreement. 
These documents are contained in the  Collection Legal/Governing Documents. 
The charges will be calculated for future years as described in these documents; 
and information about the management charges was also included in the customer 
compliance statement;
Im not persuaded that those terms would properly be considered to be unfair terms 
under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, that the purchase 
agreement is unenforceable or that those terms are enough to constitute a breach of 
contract for which Hitachi Capital would be liable under section 75;
Mr F and his wife had been members of the holiday company since November 2013 
but they bought the points rights which are the subject of this complaint in February 
2016 so they would only have had a right to attend meetings of the holiday company 
arising from the points that they bought in February 2016 after that time and not from 
2010;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr F and his wife have contacted the holiday 
company about the general meetings or to tell it that they havent received the 
notices of its meetings and the holiday company says that notices for the 2015, 2016, 
2017, 2018 and 2020 were sent to Mr F and his wife by e-mail and that they were 
received and opened;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the holiday companys articles of association, but even if there had been such a 
breach, I dont consider that it would be a breach of contract for which Hitachi Capital 
would be liable under section 75;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any 
breach of contract, or a breach of the EU timeshare directive, by the holiday 
company for which Hitachi Capital would be liable under section 75;
the December 2021 letter says that Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the holiday 
company but the level of commission wasnt disclosed to Mr F and his wife and they 
didnt consent to it and Mr Fs complaint form says that Hitachi Capital paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him;
the customer compliance statement says: We are aware that [the holiday company] 
is able to recommend credit facilities to its customers to fund their purchase, but 
understand that [the holiday company] is not independent. We have been advised 
that [the holiday company] works with a number of selected credit providers and  is 
entitled to receive a commission in respect of credit brokered; so I consider that it 
was disclosed to Mr F and his wife that the holiday company might receive a 
commission from Hitachi Capital but Ive seen no evidence to show that they asked 
Hitachi Capital for any information about the commission until their representatives 
letter to it in December 2021;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Hitachi Capital to the holiday company but from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 15% 
and Im satisfied that Hitachi Capital wouldnt have breached any duty in making any 
such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any 
commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any 
commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to 
mean that Hitachi Capital should have appreciated that not disclosing any 
commission to Mr F risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr F entered into the loan agreement in February 2016 and he repaid the loan in 
January 2021 but no complaint about the commission was made to Hitachi Capital 
until December 2021 and, if he was concerned about the commission that had been 
paid, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained about it 
sooner than he did;
the December 2021 letter says that Hitachi Capital failed to carry out a sound and 
proper credit assessment and Mr Fs complaint form says that the holiday company 
and Hitachi Capital failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the 
loan;
the loan agreement that was signed by Mr F in February 2016 included information 
about his income and expenditure, including that he was an employed home-owner 
with an annual gross income of more than £60,000  and I consider that it also 
clearly set out the interest rate and the interest that would be payable;
Hitachi Capital says that it searched Mr Fs credit record and used it with other 
information provided to calculate an overall score for him which exceeded its 
minimum lending criteria  it says that it utilises a third party affordability product to 
assist it with understanding affordability and there were no indications that Mr F 
would struggle to service the loan;
it says that Mr F told it that his gross annual income was more than £50,000 which 
was validated using data obtained from credit reference agencies and it estimated his 
net monthly income as at least £3,128 and, taking account of his existing credit 
commitments and mortgage, there were no concerns about lending him an additional 
£8,000;
the customer compliance statement says: Having carefully considered our financial 
commitments, we confirm that we are able to meet the financial obligations being 
undertaken by us in respect of our Points purchase including any financial 
commitments and repayments under a finance agreement;
the loan was made to Mr F in February 2016 and was repaid in January 2021 but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that he asked Hitachi Capital for any information about the 
affordability assessment that it conducted before his representatives December 2021 
letter and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have raised any 
concerns about the affordability assessment before then;
I consider that it was reasonable for Hitachi Capital to have concluded on the basis of 
the information that Mr F had provided that he could afford a loan with a monthly 
repayment of £124.06 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr F, that Hitachi Capital should have done more 
to assess the affordability of the loan for him, that the loan was mis-sold to him or 
that Hitachi Capital has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr Fs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan 
agreement and Mr F says that there was a lot of high pressure from the holiday 
company to purchase more points;Mr F and his wife had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given to withdraw from the purchase agreement which set out their right to 
withdraw from the agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or 
Hitachi Capital to withdraw from the purchase agreement within the withdrawal 
period;
the loan agreement also said that Mr F had the right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement without giving any reason for a period of fourteen days - but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that he contacted Hitachi Capital to withdraw from the loan 
agreement within the withdrawal period;
Mr F and his wife signed the purchase agreement in February 2016 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they complained to either the holiday company or Hitachi 
Capital about the undue pressure that they claim was applied to them until the 
December 2021 letter  if they had been unduly pressured into signing the purchase 
agreement and didnt want to buy the additional points rights, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
Hitachi Capital about that issue sooner that they did;
Mr F and his wife had bought 7,000 points rights in November 2013 and his 
complaint form about the finance providers response to the claims that hed made to 
it about that purchase says that the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement in November 2013 and him into 
entering into the loan agreement at the same time  but if theyd been unduly 
pressured into entering into those agreements in November 2013, I dont consider it 
to be likely that theyd then have allowed themselves to be unduly pressured into 
buying more points rights in February 2016;
Mr F and his wife then bought 7,500 more membership points rights from the holiday 
company in April 2016 - if theyd been unduly pressured into entering into the 
purchase agreement and the loan agreement in February 2016, I dont consider it to 
be likely that theyd then have then bought more membership points rights from the 
holiday company two months later;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr F and his wife were 
unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement in February 2016 or that 
Mr F was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement at that time or that 
the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Fs representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about 
the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses  but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr F and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr F and Hitachi 
Capital;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Fs relationship with 
Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr F and Hitachi Capital in 
these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr F for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership points rights but I consider that Hitachi Capitals response to the claims 
that had been made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hitachi Capital to refund to Mr F any of the money that he paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2023.
