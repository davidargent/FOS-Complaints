The complaint
Ms M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance (BPF) misinformed her about a debt she had with them.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator.
I was very sorry to read about Ms Ms ill health and Im aware this issue will not have helped 
her. 
I can see that BPF made mistakes here. They provided a statement that suggested a zero 
balance and they failed to update Ms M about the arrears on the account.
But Ms M doesnt dispute theres a debt on the account and BPF dont have to write that 
debt off because theyve made a mistake when reporting it.
But I think they should compensate Ms M for the distress and inconvenience their mistakes 
have caused her.
In the circumstances, I think the compensation of Â£200 they have paid is reasonable. I think 
to ask them to waive the whole of the outstanding debt would be disproportionate. 
I can see that BPF have been prepared to discuss how that repayment can be made by 
Ms M and to come to a reasonable payment plan with her when income and expenditure 
information is provided. I think thats reasonable in the circumstances. Id expect them to be 
positive and sympathetic to Ms Ms situation when discussing that plan but Im not asking 
them to take any further action.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I dont uphold this complaint about Clydesdale Financial 
Services Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2020.
