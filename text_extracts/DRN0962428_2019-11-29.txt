K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs H say The Funding  Corporation  Limited  (The Funding Corporation) mis-sold 
them a payment protection insurance  (PPI) policy.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 19 November 2019. A copy  of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint and explains why I think  
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint  should be upheld and what I think The Funding Corporation  
should do to put things  right.
Mr and Mrs H have confirmed that theyve received my provisional  decision and say they 
have nothing to add.
The Funding Corporation  says it agrees with my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As The Funding Corporation agrees with my provisional decision, and Mr and Mrs H say 
they have nothing to add, I confirm  my provisional  findings. My reasons remain  the same.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, 
The Funding Corporation  Limited should:
refund  the £90.40 Mr and Mrs H paid for PPI when they made  their contractual  
repayment on 13 August  2005;
refund  the £4,954.87 Mr and Mrs H paid for PPI on 7 June 2018;
refund  25.58% of the interest  charged  from 28 March 2007  onwards  as PPI was 
25.58% of the amount they owed  which Mr and Mrs H paid off on 7 June 2018  and 
which Ive worked  out to be £4,681.33;
pay simple  interest (at 8% per year) on each  of the above,  from the date of each 
payment until Mr and Mrs H get their money  back.
pay Mr and Mrs H £300 for any distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision  before  29 December  2019.

complaint
Mr and Mrs H say The Funding  Corporation  Limited  (The Funding Corporation) mis-sold 
them a payment protection insurance  (PPI) policy.
background
In April 2005, The Funding Corporation sold Mr and Mrs H a PPI policy when they borrowed 
£10,000. They borrowed  an extra £3,720 to pay for the policy.  This is called  a single 
premium policy  and Mr and Mrs H had to pay interest on the extra they borrowed.  The 
loan term was supposed to be 62 months.
Unfortunately, Mr and Mrs H were unable to keep  up with their loan repayments. In fact, it 
looks like they only made one contractual loan repayment. And in October 2007, 
The Funding Corporation  applied for, and obtained,  a court  order for the sum of £20,154.88, 
some court costs and any further  interest becoming  due. Ill return to this below.
In 2015, Mr and Mrs H wrote to The Funding Corporation  to complain that the PPI policy  was 
mis-sold. In December 2015,  The Funding  Corporation upheld their complaint and offered 
them just over £150 (after tax). Mr and Mrs H didnt accept the offer,  but it doesnt look like 
they took any further action.
In 2017, The Funding Corporation started  further legal proceedings. Mr and Mrs H hadnt  
made any payments  since the court order in 2007  and, according to the claim form it 
submitted to the county court, Mr and Mrs H owed The Funding Corporation  £37,311.91 
with interest continuing  to accrue  at a daily rate of £4.44. Mr and Mrs H subsequently sold 
their home and paid The Funding Corporation £38,165.64  in June 2018. This was how much 
Mr and Mrs H owed according  to The Funding  Corporation.
In July 2018, Mr and Mrs H wrote to The Funding  Corporation to complain again  that the PPI 
policy was mis-sold.
In August  2018,  The Funding Corporation upheld their complaint. This time, it offered them 
just under £5,200 (after tax). This was supposedly a full refund of everything Mr and Mrs H 
had paid for PPI (including historic interest) with simple interest at 8% per year to 
compensate them for being out of pocket.
Mr and Mrs H queried the offer. Specifically, they said it didnt include the extra  interest that 
was charged on the cost of the PPI policy between 2007 and 2017.
Finally, on 8 February 2019, The Funding Corporation wrote  to Mr and Mrs H. It said:
it had made a mistake  in 2017 when it had worked out how much Mr and Mrs H owed 
it;
in accordance with the court order it obtained in 2007, it could  have charged  interest  
at a rate of 15.9%  per year (the contractual interest rate);
instead, it had charged interest at a rate of 8% per year;
if it had removed the cost of the PPI policy (including interest)  from the amount 
Mr and Mrs H owed it when it obtained  the court order  and charged  interest  on the 
balance at a rate of 15.9% per year, Mr and Mrs H would have had to pay an extra 
£3,011.85 to settle their account;
Ref: DRN09624283it wouldnt now pursue  Mr and Mrs H for this money, but it wanted to revise  its offer;
it would  refund the extra Mr and Mrs H paid for PPI when they made their one 
contractual repayment with simple interest at 8% per year (just under £170 after tax) 
and pay them an extra £500  for any distress and inconvenience  caused.
Mr and Mrs H dont think this is fair.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
As The Funding Corporation accepts that the PPI policy was mis-sold, I dont need to decide 
whether it was. All thats left for me to decide  is what, if anything, it needs to do to put things 
right.
The Funding Corporation  says it made  a mistake when it worked out how much 
Mr and Mrs H owed it in 2017.  It says it was entitled  to charge interest at a rate of 15.9% on 
the judgment amount  the amount it says Mr and Mrs H owed it in 2007. Instead, it 
charged interest at a rate of 8% per year.  
Ive seen copies  of the original court order from 2007 and the claim form from 
November 2017.  
The claim form says the balance due as at 27 November 2017 is £37,311.91, with interest 
continuing to accrue  at a daily rate of £4.44.  
Ive also seen a letter from The Funding  Corporation to Mr H dated 4 May 2018, which  says:
Amount acceptable  in full settlement £38,014.68
The calculation is based on the balance as shown  in our records as at 4 May 2018 
according to the claim [number omitted]. As discussed this is subject to 8% court 
awarded interest which equates to £4.44  per day.

We can confirm that upon  receipt  of the above cleared funds we will request removal 
of our charge with the Land Registry.
The Funding Corporation  may now wish it had charged interest at a rate of 15.9%  per year.  
But it didnt  whether by mistake or by choice. If it was by mistake, it was a mistake it made 
repeatedly, and in court  forms as well as in correspondence to Mr and Mrs H and their 
solicitor. To be clear, I make no finding  on whether or not it was entitled to charge interest 
at a rate of 15.9% per year. I dont need  to. It told Mr and Mrs H how much  to pay to settle 
their account  and they paid it in good  faith.  Its on this basis that it now needs to calculate 
their PPI compensation.
Fair compensation
Mr and Mrs H have provided  a copy of an account  statement  dated  27 November 2017, 
which The Funding  Corporation sent them. The starting balance  was £20,089. This was the 
cash loan of £10,000, the PPI loan of £3,720, an admin fee of £40, a non-refinanced 
insurance fee of £45 and an interest  charge of £6,284.
Ref: DRN09624284Ive compared  this to the loan agreement, which shows  that if the loan had run to term, 
Mr and Mrs H would  have paid £4,580 in interest  on the cash  loan and £1,704 in interest on 
the extra they borrowed to pay for PPI. So in total, Mr and Mrs H would have paid £5,424 for 
PPI.
When The Funding  Corporation wrote to Mr and Mrs H in August 2018 and offered a full 
refund of everything  theyd paid for PPI, it said theyd paid £5,045.27. Understandably,  
Mr and Mrs H queried this.
Ive reviewed the account statement and there  was a transaction on 31 May 2006  that 
reduced the balance by £378.73. This transaction was described as written off insurance 
margin and explains the discrepancy.
When Mr and Mrs H made their one contractual payment of £333.40, they paid £90.40  
towards PPI.
So when The Funding Corporation first applied for a court order on 27 April 2007, £4,954.87 
of the £19,366.87 they owed  was for PPI.
When it obtained its interim order on 4 June  2007, Mr and Mrs H owed £20,154.88,  which  
included £400  in court costs. I assume  the rest (£388.01) was interest on £19,366.87.
The final court order  included £98 in court costs.  So when The Funding Corporation 
calculated Mr and Mrs Hs final balance, it charged  interest at 8% per year on £20,252.88. 
And, as Ive explained  above, Mr and Mrs H paid The Funding Corporation  £38,165.64 in 
June 2018.
Taking all of this into account,  I think The Funding  Corporation should:
refund  the £90.40 Mr and Mrs H paid for PPI when they made  their contractual  
repayment on 13 August  2005;
refund  the £4,954.87 Mr and Mrs H paid for PPI on 7 June 2018;
refund  25.58% of the interest  charged  from 28 March 2007  onwards  as PPI was 
25.58% of the amount they owed  which Mr and Mrs H paid off on 7 June 2018  and 
which Ive worked  out to be £4,681.33;
pay simple  interest (at 8% per year) on each  of the above,  from the date of each 
payment until Mr and Mrs H get their money  back.
Finally, we had to ask The Funding Corporation for the information  we needed to assess  this 
complaint several  times before it provided  it. And it looks like it was responsible for avoidable 
delays before the complaint was referred to our service too. Mr and Mrs H are in financial  
difficulties. I think The Funding Corporation should pay Mr and Mrs H an additional £300 for 
any distress and inconvenience caused  by the way it has handled their complaint.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I think The Funding Corporation  Limited  should  pay 
Mr and Mrs H the compensation Ive described  above.
Ref: DRN09624285So unless the comments and evidence I get by 3 December 2019  change my mind, thats 
what I will tell it to do in my final decision.
