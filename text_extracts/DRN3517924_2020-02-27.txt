K821x#15complaint
Miss B complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her. 
background
Between June  2015 and July 2018, Miss B took out 19 loans with Sunny. Her borrowing 
history is set out in the attached appendix. 
Miss B says Sunny should  not have agreed  these loans because  at the time, she was 
insolvent and in an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). According to our adjudicators 
further investigation, the IVA ran from May 2010  to October 2016.   Miss  Bs IVA practitioner 
(IP) has expressed an interest in any compensation she may receive in respect of this 
complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  should  have lent any of the loans  to Miss B. She said 
Sunny should  have  realised Miss B was in financial difficulties because of the IVA. 
In response to that view, Sunny changed its position on the complaint.  In an email  to our 
adjudicator dated  28 January 2020,  it said that it should not have agreed loans 1 to 11, 
which represents the borrowing that was provided when Miss B was in the IVA. But it didnt 
agree that loans  12 to 19 should  be upheld. In a further email, it said it agreed the complaint 
should be upheld  in respect  of loans 1 to 10. 
Miss B didnt accept  Sunnys offer. So, the matter has been passed to me to make a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN35179242the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss B could sustainably  repay  her loans   not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. There 
may even  come a point  where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on pounds and pence basis  might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt  automatically 
follow this is the case. This is because the relevant  regulations  define  sustainable  as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what that all means for Miss Bs complaint.
From the responses Sunny has provided,  it agrees that the complaint should be partly 
upheld. It has given  us conflicting information  about its position. To be clear, in respect  of 
loans 1-7, I can see that at the beginning  of the lending relationship,  Sunny knew that Miss B 
was in an IVA. A proportionate check would have revealed that she was in financial  trouble 
and likely to have difficulties repaying  her loans.  The parties are in agreement that Sunny 
should not have agreed these loans as Miss B was still in an IVA. And I also uphold the 
complaint in that regard.  
In addition to that, looking  at the overall  pattern  of the lending history,  I agree with our 
adjudicator that by loan 8, Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable and otherwise harmful and realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further 
loans. Within the space of nine months, Sunny had provided eight loans to someone who 
was in an IVA. It should have  been clear to Sunny  that Miss B was not managing  to repay  
her loans sustainably.  Sunny  ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Miss B was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed. Loan 1 was for £1,000 and 
two years later when Miss B applied for loan 19, she borrowed £500. It seems to me that 
Miss B had effectively paid large  amounts of interest  to service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
Ref: DRN35179243the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Miss Bs ability 
to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So this complaint is upheld in respect  of loans 1 to 19. Sunny must take action to put things 
right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges paid on loans  1 to 19
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 7 from Miss Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 19 must be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Bs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited must  comply  with the above  putting things right section. 
As I said above, I understand Miss B was subject  to an IVA and the IP has expressed an 
interest in any compensation she may receive. Miss B will need to bear in mind  her 
obligations to her IP. A copy  of this decision will be sent to the IP. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2020.
