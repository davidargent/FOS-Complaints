K820x#14The complaint  
Miss Bs complaint is about  the potential mis-selling of a car she financed  through  a hire 
purchase agreement  with Toyota  Financial Services (UK) Plc.  
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties so I wont  repeat  them  again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the sales invoice  didnt list the car as having  an active satellite navigation  system;
there was no mention  of the car having a satellite navigation system in the 
advertisement;
other cars advertisements did include reference to satellite navigation systems. So 
Im persuaded that if Miss Bs car did have an active system it would have been 
mentioned in the advert;
whilst  I understand Miss Bs testimony that the sales representative didnt  mention  
the satellite navigation  was inactive  I think she did have some responsibility  to ensure 
the specification  she expected was available on the vehicle she was ordering;
I understand that Miss B has explained she expected the replacement car to have 
matching features  but I think the features of this car were adequately  presented  to 
her and I dont have sufficient evidence to persuade me that the sales  representative 
misrepresented the car to her.
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Toyota Financial Services  (UK) 
Plc. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 June 2020.
