K820x#14complaint
Mrs M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund the cost of a laptop she 
never received.
To settle matters shed like PayPal to refund  her the money  she paid for the laptop.
background
Mrs M bought a laptop from a seller and paid for it using PayPal.  She says she never  received  
the item. The delivery companys calling card shows the item was left behind  a bin and the 
delivery company has acknowledged it should have  been  signed  for. The delivery company 
acknowledged this was an error.
Mrs M complained to PayPal and asked it to refund  her. PayPal  rejected her claim  because the 
seller provided confirmation to PayPal  to show  the item had been delivered.
Unhappy with PayPals  response Mrs M referred her complaint to our service. One of our 
adjudicators looked into the complaint  but he didnt recommend it should  be upheld.
He explained that PayPal provides  protection to buyers where items arent received. But it also 
offers protection to sellers  if they can provide proof of delivery. Here  the seller provided 
confirmation that the item was delivered.  So he thought PayPal  had complied with its obligations  
under the terms of the User Agreement and acted reasonably when it rejected Mrs Ms claim.
Mrs M disagrees with the investigators view. She says the item wasnt delivered  as required  by 
the User Agreement because shes  provided evidence from the delivery company  to show it 
failed to obtain a signature as required. Shes asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals User Agreement includes protection for buyers. It provides that a buyer may make 
a claim for reimbursement if, among other  things,  goods arent received. However the User 
Agreement also provides protection for sellers if theyre able to provide proof of delivery. 
Proof of delivery for physical items  means online documentation from a postal company 
that includes a) a status of delivered and the date of delivery b) the recipients address.
PayPal has provided details of the information  it was sent by the seller to prove  delivery. 
This included confirmation  from the delivery  company  to show  the item was delivered  at the 
end of November  2018. And confirmation  to show  the parcel was sent to the same address 
as this service has for Mrs M. Based  on the information  Ive seen  Im satisfied that it wasnt 
unfair of PayPal to rely on the information  provided  by the seller. So far as PayPal  was 
concerned the seller  provided enough information  to satisfy PayPal that the item was delivered 
as required by the User Agreement.  So Im satisfied that PayPal acted fairly when  it rejected Mrs 
Ms claim for a refund.
Mrs M says the item wasnt delivered because  shes provided a letter from the delivery company 
in which it acknowledges  that the item should have been signed for, but wasnt.  And the calling 
card shows her item was left behind a bin. 
Ref: DRN22624082I dont  have any reason to doubt that Mrs M never received the item. And I sympathise  with the 
situation shes now in. But unfortunately I can only look at whether or not PayPal has acted fairly 
and in accordance with its User Agreement.  Under the User Agreement PayPal  is only 
considering the dispute between the seller  and Mrs M. It would  be unfair  for me to make PayPal 
liable for the delivery  companys failure to carry  out the sellers delivery instructions because 
thats a matter between the seller  and the delivery company.
Mrs M has shown  us that she also purchased a shipping guarantee from the seller. Its open  
to Mrs M to try to recover her money from the seller under the shipping guarantee and for the 
seller to claim against the delivery company for failing  to ensure the item was signed  for. But 
unfortunately, as the investigator  has already  explained, our rules dont allow me to consider a 
complaint against  the delivery  company or against the seller.
It follows that I do not uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
