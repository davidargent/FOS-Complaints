The complaint
Mr & Mrs H complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to accept 
instructions to stop sending chequebooks and debit cards in the post after they were stolen. 
Theyve also complained that NatWest didnt properly liaise with a police investigation 
resulting in a criminal investigation being dropped.
What happened
Mr & Mrs H chequebook was stolen and used in an attempt to take money from their 
account. 
Mr & Mrs H asked the bank to stop sending items by post as they were concerned that they 
were being targeted by criminals. Shortly after, debit cards for a newly opened account were 
sent to Mr & Mrs home address and were intercepted, resulting in the loss of funds from their 
account which NatWest refunded.
The police were notified about the theft and started to investigate the matter. Mr & Mrs H 
raised a complaint with NatWest about how they were administering their accounts and 
about how the banks police liaison team had failed to properly work with the police.
NatWest accepted their customer service had dropped below their expected levels but 
couldnt ask the police to re-start a criminal investigation. NatWest couldnt find any evidence 
of internal collusion in the interception of Mr & Mrs Hs items. NatWest awarded £200 
compensation for their failings and suggested alternative ways of securely sending new 
cards and cheque books to Mr & Mrs H.
Mr & Mrs H remained unhappy with the way NatWest had handled their complaint and 
brought it to our service for an independent review. Whilst the investigation was under way, 
Mr & Mrs H received a debit card through the post against their explicit instructions to 
NatWest and raised a further complaint with them. NatWest accepted theyd failed to prevent 
the card from being posted and awarded a further £150 compensation for the oversight.
Both complaints were looked into by an investigator and he thought that whilst NatWest had 
let Mr & Mrs H down, theyd provided full redress for any stolen funds and an appropriate 
amount of compensation for the way NatWest had administered Mr & Mrs Hs accounts.
Mr & Mrs H accepted the compensation from the bank but wanted to challenge the way 
NatWest had handled the investigation. The complaint has now been passed to me to make 
a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read all the documents supplied by both parties and can understand why Mr & Mrs H 
were concerned about the security on their account. It would be worrying to think that 
fraudsters had targeted their post and its only natural to want their bank to take the matter 
seriously. 
Im pleased to see that any of the transactions that happened as a result of the issues here 
have now been refunded. Both parties accept thats the right thing to do here and I agree. 
So, Ill just be focusing here on the aspects of Mr and Mrs Hs complaint that arent resolved 
 around how NatWest handled this and the service it provided.
In doing so, its worth saying that my role is to look at the individual dispute here and decide 
whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Its not the role of this service to criticise a 
business policies or processes in a wider sense, nor are we here to punish or fine 
businesses as the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, might. Instead, Ill be looking at 
what happened here and deciding whats fair and reasonable in the individual 
circumstances. 
The crux of this complaint is that Mr & Mrs H thought that someone, or perhaps more than 
one person, within NatWest were intercepting their post to steal their chequebook and debit 
cards. NatWest investigated and couldnt find any evidence to support this. Im satisfied that 
NatWest has performed a full investigation here and I havent seen any evidence which 
leads me to think this is whats likely to have happened here either.
Postal theft isnt uncommon and could potentially happen at any stage in the postal journey, 
where there are other organisations and people involved in the delivery of the post outside of 
NatWest. Without evidence that NatWest employees were involved, I cant conclude theyve 
done anything wrong when they sent the items to Mr & Mrs H. But, I would have expected 
NatWest to change how they delivered these items once they were aware of the risk to Mr & 
Mrs Hs security. This is what they did, offering more secure alternatives to avoid future 
thefts and unauthorised transactions on Mr & Mrs Hs accounts. I think that was fair in the 
circumstances.
Ive thought about whether NatWest failed to take the situation seriously. NatWest 
acknowledged there were some failings, including with their police liaison team which must 
have been disappointing for Mr & Mrs H. This would have left them frustrated by NatWests 
approach to their concerns. The failure to prevent the last debit card from being posted 
would also have reduced Mr & Mrs Hs confidence in NatWest.
NatWest accepted this and I think this was more an administrative oversight rather than 
evidence of NatWest failing to take the situation seriously. In these circumstances, I think 
what NatWest paid Mr and Mrs H in compensation fairly reflected the impact their mistakes 
had on them. NatWest explained that the police liaison team isnt customer facing so I think 
that by giving feedback to them about how theyre actions affected Mr & Mrs H was an 
appropriate way to handle their concerns.
Any ongoing investigation past this point is now a matter for the police to take forward. Its 
not something I can consider any further. But in my view, NatWest has done enough to put 
this situation right for Mr and Mrs H in a fair and reasonable way and I wont be asking them 
to do anything further. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank PlcUnder the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 August 2021.
