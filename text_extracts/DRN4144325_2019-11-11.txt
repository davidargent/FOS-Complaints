K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains about Sainsburys  Bank Plcs  (Sainsburys) handling of a payment dispute.  
background 
In late 2017 Mr W opened a credit card account  with Sainsburys. Under a promotion offered  
at this time Mr W was entitled to, subject to certain conditions  being met, an interest rate of 
0% (per annum) on purchases  for 32 months.
On 20 April 2018, Mr W placed an order with a supplier for 29 items costing £616.45 
(inclusive of delivery). The individual cost of these  items ranged  between £5.50 and £52.00.
On 23 April 2018, Sainsburys  debited  Mr Ws account with £616.45  (with  a transaction  date 
of 20 April 2018).
In May 2018, Mr W contacted Sainsburys to say that he hadnt received the goods for which 
he had been charged £616.45.  
On 31 May 2018, Sainsburys  refunded £616.45  back to Mr Ws account (backdated to 
20 April 2018) and attempted a chargeback. 
On 16 August 2018, with the chargeback having been unsuccessful, Sainsburys re-debited  
Mr Ws account with £616.45.  Interest on this sum was charged from 16 August 2019 (the 
date of the re-debit) rather than 23 April 2019 (the date or the original debit).
In June 2018 Sainsburys charged Mr W a late payment fee of £12.00 (having received no 
payment in respect of his May 2018  statement).  It also removed the 0% interest  rate Mr W 
had been benefiting from since his account had been opened.
In July 2018 Sainsburys charged  Mr W a late payment  fee of £12.00  (having received no 
payment in respect of his June 2018 statement). It also charged  Mr W £70.79  interest.
In August  2018  Sainsburys  refunded  Mr W £24.00 in late payment fees and £70.79  interest.
In September  2018 Sainsburys charged  Mr W a late payment  fee of £12.00  (having 
received no payment in respect of his August 2018 statement). It also charged Mr W £84.64  
interest.
In December 2018 Mr W raised a complaint with Sainsburys about  how his payment dispute 
had been handled and to complain that he had been  charged  interest  and fees on his 
account since July 2018.
Sainsburys responded to Mr W to say that it believed  it had done  nothing wrong. In 
summary it said it had attempted a chargeback but this was unsuccessful, there were 
insufficient grounds to uphold  a section 75 claim under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
(section 75) and that all interest and charges  debited to the account had been done  so 
correctly and in line with the account  terms and conditions. However, it offered Mr W £30.00  
for what it says was a delay in responding to his complaint.
Ref: DRN41443252Unhappy with Sainsburys response to his complaint, Mr W referred it to our service where it 
was considered by one of our Investigators. The investigator concluded that Sainsburys had 
done nothing wrong. He said that Sainsburys had acted fairly and reasonably in declining 
Mr Ws section  75 claim,  albeit on the grounds that each item had a cash  price not 
exceeding £100.
Mr W didnt agree with the investigators  conclusions so the complaint was passed to me for 
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in October 2019. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account; 
relevant law and regulations, relevant  regulatory rules, guidance and standards and 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate,  what I would consider to have been good  
industry practice at the relevant time.
One relevant piece  of legislation applicable here is section 75. This provides 
protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. 
I dont underestimate  Mr Ws frustration about all that has gone  on here, and how 
upset he is about  his treatment by the supplier and the delivery company. However, I 
should make  it clear from the outset that my role is to look at whether Sainsburys 
acted fairly  and reasonably in applying the processes available  to assist Mr W. 
chargeback attempt
In certain circumstances, when a cardholder has a dispute with a supplier, as Mr W 
does here,  Sainsburys  (as the credit card issuer)  can attempt a chargeback. 
Generally we say its fair for a card issuer  to attempt a chargeback  - or to challenge 
a payment - if theres a reasonable  prospect of success, such as when goods  arent  
received.
As I understand it Sainsburys raised the chargeback but it was defended by the 
supplier on the grounds that the items had been despatched and received by Mr W. 
Now I appreciate that Mr W says he didnt receive the items. I also appreciate  that 
there appears to be some  discrepancy  in the suppliers account  of what  happened  
and that Sainsburys  now has very little documentation in support of its chargeback 
attempt because of the time that has passed.
But having  received the response to its chargeback  request that Sainsburys says it 
did I wouldnt have expected it to have done  anything more in this instance. So it 
follows, I dont think that it acted unfairly or unreasonably in not taking the 
chargeback further.
Ref: DRN41443253section 75 claim
Under section 75, subject  to certain  criteria,  consumers  who use certain  types of 
finance have an equal claim against the creditor for any breach of contract  or 
misrepresentation by the supplier. One of these  criteria is that section 75 doesnt  
apply to a claim where it relates to a single item to which the supplier has attached  a 
cash price not exceeding  £100.
I appreciate Mr W bought 29 items for £616.45 under one order.  But the 29 items  
were available to buy separately each with a cash price not exceeding £100. So I 
dont consider that section 75 applies to this transaction as it was for 29 single items, 
each with a cash  price not exceeding £100.  
As Ive found that section 75 didnt apply  to this transaction, I dont think  that 
Sainsburys has acted unfairly or unreasonably  in declining  Mr Ws section  75 claim, 
albeit it did so for different reasons.
Interest and fees
Section 3.3 of the account terms and conditions Mr W agreed to be bound by state:
Our interest rates are as follows.
On balance 
transfers, related interest  
and chargesOn cheques, 
related interest

sums

We may apply the standard interest rate [25.69% per annum] to transactions  before 
the end of the special  promotion period if any month you do not make at least  your 
minimum payment by the payment  date
Ref: DRN41443254Section 5.2 of the account terms and conditions Mr W agreed to be bound by state:
We will charge:-
£12.00 each month in which a payment amount that should  have been paid 
remains outstanding
Having looked  at the statements provided  by Sainsburys I can see that on 3 
separate occasions Mr W made no payment  to his account. So in my view 
Sainsburys has, in removing Mr Ws promotion  rate and charging him the three fees 
of £12.00, acted  in line with what the account  terms and conditions allow.  
I also dont think that Sainsburys  has acted unfairly or unreasonably in removing the 
promotion rate and charging the three  £12.00 fees that it did. I say this because Ive 
seen insufficient  evidence that Mr W was unable to make the three  monthly 
payments.
Furthermore the sum in dispute  only made up a small  proportion  of Mr Ws total 
account balance.  So even if I was to accept  that Mr W might have been reluctant to 
pay anything towards the disputed  sum of £616.45, and Im not saying  he was, he 
still had a larger sum that he should  have been  making monthly payments towards.
I appreciate that Mr W will be disappointed  with my findings, but Im satisfied that 
Sainsburys hasnt acted  unfairly or unreasonably in the particular circumstances of 
this case. However  if Mr W is, for whatever  reason, struggling to maintain his account  
he should contact  Sainsburys  and let it know. I would also remind  Sainsburys that if 
Mr W is in financial  difficulties, it should treat him both positively and sympathetically.
Sainsburys has already  made an offer to pay Mr W £30.00, for what it says was a 
delay in responding to his complaint. Mr W should  contact Sainsburys  directly if he 
now wishes to accept  this.
Mr W responded to my provisional  decision, but provided nothing materially new for my 
consideration.
Sainsburys responded to my provisional  decision to say it agreed with it and that it had 
nothing further  to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Mr W hasnt provided anything materially new for my consideration and given that 
Sainsburys says it agrees with what Ive already  said and that it has nothing  further to add, I 
see no reason to depart from my provisional  decision  and I now confirm it as final.  
Ref: DRN41443255my final decision
My final decision is I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 December  2019.
