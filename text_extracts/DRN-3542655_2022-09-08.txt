The complaint
Ms V complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) provided conflicting 
information about her eligibility for a loan and about changing her repayment date. She also 
complains they didnt place a hold on her account. 
What happened
Ms V had a repayment arrangement in place in relation to a loan she had with NatWest. 
When the repayment arrangement ended, NatWest said Ms V could refinance her loan to 
keep her repayments at an affordable level. The loan refinance put in place was called a 
Loan 15. Ms V says she was told she could change her repayment date within 45 days and 
without needing to make a double payment. Ms V says, when she tried to arrange for the 
repayment date to be changed, she was told she would need to make two repayments close 
together. Ms V complained that shed been given conflicting information about her eligibility 
for the Loan 15 and was of the understanding she was getting a different loan. Ms V also 
complained about issues she experienced when she wanted to change her repayment date. 
Ms V says this led to her account falling into arrears. 
NatWest responded and explained the Loan 15 was the refinancing of Ms Vs original loan 
and their notes show that it was made clear to Ms V that she was agreeing to a Loan 15 and 
not being sold a new loan. NatWest also explained, when Ms V asked about changing her 
repayment date, she was correctly told she would need to make a payment on the original 
contractual date followed by another on the next preferred date. NatWest said, although they 
couldnt locate the call where Ms V says she was told NatWest would place a hold on her 
loan account, they had no reason to dispute her account of events. So, they upheld this 
complaint point and paid Ms V £50. NatWest had also previously refunded arrears interest of 
£85 for not giving Ms V the right option about having a Loan 15 account and also paid £150. 
And, a further £75 for giving conflicting information regarding the repayment date.   
Our investigator looked into things for Ms V. During the investigation, NatWest paid an 
additional £100 compensation for a lack of communication. Our investigator thought the total 
compensation and refund paid to Ms V was reasonable and she wouldnt be asking NatWest 
to take any further steps. Ms V disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided the steps already taken by NatWest to resolve the complaint 
are fair and reasonable. So, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Ms V will 
be disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
Loan 15 account and documentation
I can see Ms V was granted a payment holiday in relation to her original loan and, when this 
came to an end in September 2020, NatWest explained they couldnt offer a further 
extension. NatWest then decide that Ms V is eligible for a refinancing loan. 
NatWest have provided system information which shows, over a period of a few months, 
documentation was sent but wasnt received by Ms V. A system note in November says    
Ms V is eligible for a Loan 15. NatWest have provided a copy of their Loan 15 criteria and 
the note shows how Ms V meets the eligibility criteria. A separate note on the same date 
says Ms V still hasnt received the documentation. A note in December shows Ms V still 
hasnt received the documentation and Ms V then raises a complaint. 
NatWest respond in January 2021 and explain the position for customers who had a loan 
deferral for six months and wish to have the term extended instead of making a lump sum 
payment. They say, if this was to happen the amount of additional interest the customer 
would pay would mean their existing loan will need to be extended for 15 months or more. 
NatWest explain theyre therefore offering those customers the option to refinance their 
existing loan with an interest rate of 3.9% with the monthly repayment amount in-line with 
their current loan repayment. NatWest say, when a customer is entitled to do this a letter is 
sent asking them to contact NatWest so the next steps can be discussed and to quote Loan 
15. NatWest apologise that this information wasnt discussed with Ms V sooner. They say 
they try their best to train each of their representatives on how to properly handle customer 
issues, including how to escalate problems that they are unable to assist with. NatWest 
accept that on this occasion Ms Vs queries were not handled properly. To put things right, 
NatWest refund the arrears interest by crediting £85 into Ms Vs loan account and credit the 
account by a further £150 which they say is for miscommunication regarding eligibility for 
Loan 15. 
A further note in February shows Ms V calls NatWest after receiving documents relating to 
an early settlement figure. Ms V complains and says she never requested this. The call 
handler explains this relates to the Loan 15 application and, as part of this process, NatWest 
need to obtain an early settlement figure to then create a new loan with the lower rate of 
interest. Ms V also says she hasnt received the Loan 15 agreement and also queries why 
the payment date was for 30 February 2021 when there are only 28 days in that month. The 
call handler explains the agreement paperwork was sent two days ago and also explains the 
date is based on Ms Vs current repayment plan and the payment for February will just be 
taken earlier. I can see NatWest say the oversight in relation to the date of 30 February was 
most likely human error. Ms Vs Loan 15 account is then opened in March. 
Firstly, in relation to the documentation, I can see this was sent on most occasions so its not 
clear why it wasnt received by Ms V. I can see Ms V does complete the documentation 
promptly when she eventually receives it. So, I believe she didnt receive it on the previous 
occasions it was sent as I think she wouldve completed it. That said, I cant hold NatWest 
responsible if it wasnt received as their responsibility would only extend to ensuring its 
addressed correctly and sent. There was one occasion where NatWest apologise for the 
documents not being sent. But, given there were occasions, both before and after this 
occasion, when the documents were sent, I think the apology offered is reasonable. 
In relation to the Loan 15, its clear from the information Ive seen  which includes the 
agreement and the eligibility criteria  that its the Loan 15 which has been taken out. I 
understand though why Ms V believed she was getting a new loan rather than a refinancing 
of her existing loan. I can see NatWest provide an explanation about the Loan 15 in their 
complaint response in January 2021. They apologise this information wasnt discussed 
sooner and accept it was their error which led to issues surrounding Ms Vs eligibility. I can see theyve taken steps to refund Ms V any arrears interest and also paid £150. And, I think 
thats reasonable in the circumstances. 
Repayment date
I understand Ms V says she was told by NatWest that, once the first repayment is made, 
theres a 45-day period in which she can change her repayment date. I can see Ms V calls 
NatWest on 20 May 2021 and asks for her repayment date to be changed to the 10th of each 
month. The call handler explains Ms V will still need to make a payment for that month on 
the due date of 30 May and then the repayment can be made the following month on Ms Vs 
preferred date, this being 10 June.   
NatWest say the explanation given to Ms V is correct as a loan repayment would need to be 
made for each month. Ive looked at the Loan 15 agreement and this does require monthly 
payments to be made. The agreement does say the repayment date can be changed but I 
cant see any reference to there being a 45-day period in which to change the date. Taking 
this into account, I cant say the information given by the call handler is unreasonable. This is 
because Ms V calls on 20 May and wants to change her repayment date to the 10th of each 
month  but, for May, that date had already passed. So, had NatWest changed the date at 
that point, it wouldve meant the next repayment would be due on 10 June, meaning no 
repayment would be made in May. This would not only have breached the terms of the 
agreement but couldve led to the account being in arrears. 
NatWest do apologise this wasnt made clear in previous conversations, and while they 
couldnt locate any information which showed theyd told Ms V about a 45-day period, they 
accepted Ms V mightve been of the understanding she could change the repayment date 
within 45 days and then not have to make any payment until the new repayment date. I can 
see NatWest paid Ms V £75 compensation for conflicting information in relation to changing 
the loan repayment date. And, I think thats reasonable in the circumstances. 
Placing a hold on account 
I can see from information provided by NatWest, Ms Vs last repayment on her Loan 15 
account was in June 2021. This has led to NatWest sending chasers for the repayments to 
be made. I understand Ms V wanted NatWest to place her Loan 15 account and any interest 
on hold while her complaint was being investigated. I can see NatWest confirmed a hold had 
been placed on the account until the complaint had been concluded. Our service then asked 
NatWest to consider placing a hold on the interest and they responded to say they couldnt 
do this without defaulting the account and referring it to their Collections department. I 
acknowledge Ms Vs request for the hold to be put in place on the interest while the 
investigation was ongoing, but I think its important to add that theres no obligation on the 
business to agree to this. So, I cant say NatWest acted unfairly here.  
I can see however that NatWest have paid a combined £150 compensation to Ms V for 
issues associated with her request for the account to be put on hold. I can see £50 
compensation was paid as NatWest accepted Ms Vs account of events about being told 
previously that her account would be placed on hold during the complaint investigation. 
NatWest then paid £100 compensation for the lack of communication around placing Ms Vs 
account on hold which led to Ms V having to repeat herself when discussing this with 
NatWest. I think this is reasonable in the circumstances. 
I do acknowledge Ms Vs concern about her account being in arrears, but I dont think this is 
down to an error by NatWest. Under the Loan 15 agreement, theres an obligation for Ms V 
to make monthly repayments and I cant see theres any dispute that Ms V hasnt made 
repayments since July 2021. I understand Ms V feels this issue has arisen because NatWest didnt change her repayment date, but I cant see there was a refusal to do this. Instead, 
NatWest explained the repayment for May would still need to be made which meant another 
repayment would be due less than two weeks later. I understand why this wasnt ideal for  
Ms V but I cant say NatWest have acted against the terms of the Loan 15 agreement. 
While I acknowledge the financial difficulties Ms V is facing with the arrears having built up, 
we do expect lenders to respond positively and sympathetically. I can see NatWest say Ms V 
can contact their Financial Heath and Support team to discuss options in relation to clearing 
the arrears. 
  
Taking this all into account, I agree there have been errors by NatWest but I think the steps 
theyve taken to put things right are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. So, I wont be 
asking them to take any further steps. 
I understand Ms V will be disappointed, and I acknowledge her reasons for why she believes 
the errors by NatWest, particularly the issue around not changing her repayment date, has 
caused the issue with her arrears. I wish to reassure Ms V Ive read and considered 
everything she has sent in, but if I havent mentioned a particular point or piece of evidence, 
it isnt because I havent seen it or thought about it. Its just that I dont feel I need to 
reference it to explain my decision. This isnt intended as a discourtesy and is a reflection of 
the informal nature of our service. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2022.
