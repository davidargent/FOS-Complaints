The complaint
Mr O complains in his capacity as director of his company that I will refer to as T. 
Mr O complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked Ts business 
account. Mr O believes that NatWest did this as a result of racial profiling and discrimination 
against Mr O. 
What happened
On 11 November 2021, T received a credit into its account of £390. The credit was received 
from a customer of T, who Ill refer to as W. 
On 25 November 2021, NatWest received notification from the Ws bank, to say that W had 
reported that the payment was made as a result of a scam. 
Because of this notification, on 26 November 2021, NatWest removed the funds from Ts 
account and placed a block on the account. NatWest spoke to Mr O on 26 November 2021 
about the transaction and the funds were then re-credited to the account on the next working 
day which was 29 November 2021, and the block on the account was removed. 
Mr O, on behalf of T, is unhappy with NatWests processes. He doesnt feel it was fair of 
NatWest to have investigated the claim made by W, and he doesnt think it was fair of it to 
have temporarily removed the funds and blocked the account. Mr O believes that NatWest 
has racially discriminated against him, and this is the reason the payment was investigated. 
Mr O would like to be compensated for NatWests actions.
NatWest didnt uphold Mr Os complaint. It explained that its process is in place to protect its 
customers and itself. It said that the checks are non-discriminative, and information such as 
race or ethnicity is not processed. And so, NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong 
when it blocked Ts account. 
Our Investigator looked at Mr Os complaint. They found that NatWest acted fairly when it 
blocked Ts account, and so they didnt think NatWest needed to do anything to put things 
right.
Mr O disagreed with the Investigators outcome. He reiterated that he had been discriminated 
against by NatWest and NatWest shouldnt be allowed to just block the account. 
Mr O asked for an Ombudsmans decision on the matter and so the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint.
I have seen NatWests internal notes which show information was received from Ws bank to 
say that the £390 payment it had sent to T was a scam. Because of this, NatWest had a duty 
to investigate the information it had received. 
Section 5.3 of the terms and conditions of Ts account state:
We may suspend, restrict or stop access to your account or to certain services (such as 
your card or online banking) if:.youve broken any term of this agreement in a serious way. 
Well usually tell you before or immediately after we take any of these steps. Well also 
explain our reasons for doing so, unless were unable to contact you or theres a legal or 
security reason which means we cant provide an explanation.
NatWest acted on legitimate information it received from Ws bank when it blocked Ts 
account. The terms and conditions of the account allow NatWest to restrict the use of the 
account in certain circumstances  and I agree that NatWest has fairly applied its terms and 
conditions in this case. In addition to this, NatWest have a regulatory obligation to investigate 
allegations of fraud, and it appears to have carried out its obligation here, so I cant fairly say 
it has done anything wrong.
I can see that NatWest contacted Mr O on the same day it restricted the account, and once it 
had satisfied itself that there was no fraud risk, it removed the block from the account and 
recredited the £390 back to Ts account. With this in mind, I find that NatWest acted quickly 
on the information it received and resolved the issue in a timely manner. 
While I appreciate T might not be happy with NatWests processes here, I dont think its 
actions in blocking the account and temporarily removing the funds was unreasonable. And I 
think Mr O has been treated in the same way as other customers in similar situations. I 
havent seen anything that makes me think NatWest has been discriminatory against Mr O.
In summary, I think NatWest blocked Ts account as a result of the information it received, 
and not as a result of it racially discriminating against Mr O. And so, I cant agree that 
NatWest has done anything wrong in this case. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold the complaint made by Mr O, on behalf of T.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2023.
