The complaint
L, a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked an
international payment into its bank account. L says that NatWest has blocked further
payments in and out of its account.
What happened
L has a business bank account with NatWest. Through its director Mrs H, L has complained
that in 2018, NatWest blocked its account which prevented L from receiving a payment of
$4.5 million from someone wanting to invest in its work. Mrs H says that as L didnt receive
the funds, it hasnt been able to continue trading.
Mrs H says that NatWest told her that the investor didnt exist and that this was a case of
fraud.
Mrs H says she went on to pay money to the investor so that instead of resending the $4.5
million to NatWest, the investor could help set up a foreign bank account to deposit the
investment.
Mrs H complained to NatWest in 2020 and it sent final response letters in 2020 and again in
January 2022. NatWest told Mrs H that it wasnt possible for the bank to have stopped a
payment coming into Ls account. NatWest asked for more details about when the payment
was alleged to have been made to L. NatWest offered Mrs H £150 to apologise for the
distress she felt when a member of staff wasnt helpful to her in 2018.
During Ls complaint to this service, Mrs H raised two new points - the first about not having
a debit card and the second that NatWest had blocked payments from Ls account to a
limited company. NatWest didnt consent to us considering these new issues as part of Ls
current complaint. So, the investigator told Mrs H that she should first raise them with
NatWest before coming back to this service if needed.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ls complaint be upheld. She didnt think NatWest
had ever received the payment of $4.5 million. The investigator thought that Mrs H may have
been the victim of a scam. The investigator told Mrs H that if she was still sure the investor
sent L the money, she should provide further details including dates, payment references
and correspondence from the paying bank.
Mrs H is unhappy with the investigators recommendation and wants a full investigation. She
doesnt think its fair for NatWest to only pay £150 for the abuse shes suffered over the
years. Mrs H asks whether this service has seen her bank statements. She wants to know
what the police and authorities are doing if the investment is a scam. Mrs H says she asked
the sender of the money to confirm to this service that the funds are real.
Mrs H sent us a copy of an email from someone at a foreign bank saying that money left its
account and was sent to the UK. The email says its not a scam and suggests that Mrs H
should ignore them.
The investigator told Mrs H that it didnt change her view on Ls complaint. Mrs H wants to
know why NatWest didnt consult her before blocking Ls accounts.
After considering all the evidence I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to L and 
NatWest on 21 September 2022. I said:
I realise that Ive summarised Ls complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so
using my own words. The rules that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt
mean Ive not considered everything that both parties have given to me.
I should also say L is the complainant and not Mrs H. This means I cant consider any upset
or loss that Mrs H has felt personally. I can only consider whether NatWest acted fairly and
reasonably towards L. If Mrs H is concerned about the way that NatWest has handled her
personal bank accounts, she would need to make a separate complaint.
I will first deal with one aspect of Ls complaint about payments to a limited company being
blocked from its account in 2018. The investigator told Mrs H that as this was a new
complaint, NatWest wouldnt consent to us considering it. The investigator told Mrs H she
would have to raise it first with NatWest. But on considering Ls complaint file, I thought that
NatWest had already referred to this aspect in its final response in January 2022. So, I didnt
think it was fair to require L to raise its concerns about the payments as a separate
complaint.
NatWest has confirmed that it has no record of any payments to the limited company being
blocked in 2018 or since. And that it has no record of any attempts by L to set up payments
to the limited company. I have seen a copy of Ls statement which shows £4,000 being
received from the limited company and a 1 pence payment going out to the limited company
on the same day  presumably to confirm Ls account details were correct. But theres no
evidence of other payments to the limited company. Unless L has evidence to support what
it says about NatWest blocking payments from Ls account to the limited company, I cant
reasonably uphold this aspect of the complaint.
The investigator told Mrs H that she can apply to NatWest for a debit card for Ls account as
the previous one was cancelled in August 2020 after it expired. If Mrs H remains unhappy
about this, she will need to first raise her concerns with NatWest.
Much of the complaint that L brought to this service relates to the anticipated payment of 
$4.5 million. I appreciate that Mrs H is certain that the payment was made and that NatWest
somehow rejected it but I dont have enough evidence to conclude this was the case.
Although Mrs H has given this service and NatWest copy emails and letters relating to the
investment, NatWest says it has no record of any attempt to make such a large payment into
Ls account and that it wouldnt be able to return money to the sender unless asked to.
Mrs H thinks NatWest has done something to tamper with the evidence of the payment but
Im not persuaded this is the case. I dont have details such as the exact date on which the
payment was alleged to have been made, when it was alleged to have been returned, the
exact amount, a payment reference, the name of the payer or anything from the paying
bank. Without this information, I cant reasonably expect NatWest to do more than its
already done to try and locate the payment on Ls behalf. This means I dont find NatWest
has treated L unreasonably.
I think its more likely that L has been targeted as part of a scam, that involves the promise of
a significant but non-existent sum of money. When the payment doesnt arrive, the person
being targeted is tricked into paying money to the fraudster.Mrs H says she has previously involved the police but if she remains concerned about any
payments that have been made from Ls account or her personal account to anybody saying
they connected to the foreign investor, I recommend that she speaks again to the police or
Action Fraud. It wouldnt be for this service to comment further on what action the police
should take in response to any approach that Mrs H may make on Ls behalf.
In recent correspondence between the investigator and Mrs H, it does seem she thinks there
may have been some fraud but is still concerned that NatWest blocked Ls accounts without
first consulting her. Although I can appreciate Mrs Hs concerns, I dont have evidence to
suggest NatWest placed any block on Ls account. So, there wasnt anything about which
NatWest needed to consult L.
NatWest has already made an offer to pay £150 to apologise to Mrs H for any distress she
felt when attending its branch in 2018. As I have already said, I am only considering this
complaint as it relates to L and not Mrs H. This means that despite Mrs H being unhappy
with the offer, I dont comment further. However, NatWest confirms the offer is still open for
acceptance. So, Mrs H should contact NatWest directly if she wishes to accept it.
Further submissions
NatWest hasnt responded and Mrs H is very unhappy with my provisional decision. In 
summary she doesnt think that I have addressed her complaint. Mrs H wants to know who 
stopped the payment from Ls investor, who stopped payments to the limited company and 
who stopped her debit card. Mrs H is unhappy with the way that NatWest treated her and 
wants to know who has the right to prevent L from working.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful to Mrs H for the points shes raised, but my final decision remains the same as I 
outlined in my provisional decision.
As I said in my provisional decision, I dont have enough evidence to conclude that any 
payments to or from L were stopped by NatWest. Although Mrs H would like me to deal with 
this aspect of Ls complaint, she hasnt provided any further evidence which might have led 
me to change my decision.
NatWests records show that Ls debit card was cancelled after it expired. It would be for L to 
complain to NatWest if it remains unhappy with this explanation.
Although Mrs H is unhappy with the way that NatWest has treated her, the complaint that 
Ive decided has been made by L, not Mrs H personally. So, my decision has focussed on 
the treatment of L by NatWest rather than Mrs H.
As I said in my provisional decision  NatWests offer to pay Mrs H £150 to apologise for any 
distress she felt in branch in 2018 remains open. I leave it with Mrs H to let NatWest know if 
she wants to accept its offer.
Despite what Mrs H says about NatWest preventing L from working, for all the reasons Ive 
outlined above, I dont have enough evidence to conclude that this is the case. I appreciate 
that this will be frustrating for Mrs H.Finally, Mrs H has mentioned the involvement of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 
Ls complaint. I want to make it clear that this service hasnt referred Ls complaint to the 
FCA. It would be for Mrs H to decide what further steps, if any, she now wants to take on 
behalf of L. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2022.
