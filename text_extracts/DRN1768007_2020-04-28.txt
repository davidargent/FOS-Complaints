In our most recent review of the case our adjudicator  upheld  Miss Gs complaint about loans 
5  14 and thought that these loans shouldnt  have been given. Sunny disagreed  and the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss G could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN17680072But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss G could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Gs complaint.
Sunny says it completed income and expenditure  checks  and enquired  about  Miss Gs short-  
term lending commitments, and I think this was reasonable for loans 1  4. However, by the 
time Miss G came back for loan 5 I think  a full review of her circumstances,  including  a 
review of her lending history with Sunny so far, wouldve been more proportionate.  
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 5 and 6 ought to have led 
Sunny to decide  not to lend these loans, or any further loans to Miss G. I say this because 
even though Sunny says it enquired into Miss Gs other short-term commitments, Ive seen 
evidence that has persuaded  me that Miss G was borrowing from other  short-term  lenders at 
the time.  Miss G also had loans 1 and 4 outstanding  with Sunny at the time.  This evidence 
suggests that Miss G wasnt  managing her finances  well and would  therefore  have been 
unlikely to repay this loan or any subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN17680073Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Gs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 7 I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss G was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss G had taken out seven loans within five months and had 
been indebted to Sunny for this entire period.  So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was 
more likely than not Miss G was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying 
her previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Miss Gs loan amounts varied  between £250 and £400, but the amounts borrowed 
werent significantly reducing over time. So, at the point of applying  for loan 7 Sunny 
ought to have known that Miss G was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Miss G was provided  with a new loan before paying off the 
previous or within weeks of settling a previous one. 
Miss G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out nine months after Miss Gs first. So, Miss G had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss G borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back  if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
a)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Miss G towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  it has already  refunded.
b)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by 
Miss G which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss G 
originally made  the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
c)Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Miss G as though they had 
Ref: DRN17680074been repayments of the principal on all outstanding  loans. If this results in Miss G 
having made overpayments then it should  refund these overpayments  with 8% 
simple interest* calculated  on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint  is settled. Sunny should  then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should  be paid to Miss G. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Miss G. Sunny  shouldnt pursue outstanding  balances made up of principal it 
has already written-off.
e)Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Miss Gs credit  file in 
relation to loans  5 and 6. The overall pattern  of Miss Gs borrowing  for loans 7 to 14 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove  these 
loans entirely from Miss Gs credit  file. Sunny does not have to remove  loans  7, 11, 
13 and 14 from Miss Gs credit  file until they have  been  repaid, but Sunny should still 
remove any adverse information  recorded  about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Miss G compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 May 2020..
