K821x#15complaint
Miss D says Gain  Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream  (Lending  Stream), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss D says she felt pressure to top up her loans and didnt understand the risks 
of extending her borrowing. She had to borrow from other short-term credit providers and is 
now in debt trying to repay her lending. 
background
This complaint is about 25 short-term loans Lending Stream  provided to Miss D between 
March 2017 and December 2018.  The loans all had a term of six months and the amounts 
borrowed ranged from £50 to £500. Miss Ds borrowing history is attached in the appendix to 
this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ds complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 12 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as Miss Ds borrowing suggested she was persistently  
reliant on short-term credit. 
Lending Stream agreed and said it was willing to make an offer for loans 12 to 25. 
In the meantime, another of our adjudicators reconsidered  the complaint. They thought the 
complaint should  be upheld  at an earlier loan, from loan seven. Our adjudicator  wrote to the 
parties and Miss D agreed  with the second adjudicators opinion. We didnt hear back  from 
Lending Stream
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Miss D could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN83806422the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Miss D could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss D didnt comment on the second  adjudicators  opinion that loans  one to six shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss D had with Lending  Stream. So, it is something I will take into account 
when considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint  in part. Ill explain why. 
Like our second adjudicator I dont think that Lending Stream  should have given Miss D any 
further loans when she applied for loan seven. I say this because  when  the loan was applied  
for Miss D still had loans  four to six outstanding.  They  were  all taken out within one month of 
each other  and if they were to run to their agreed term date, there would still be another  five 
monthly repayments to be made on all of them, as well as the additional borrowing for loan 
seven. It was questionable that Miss Ds borrowing behaviour was unsustainable. 
Such a quick uptake in borrowing and having  four loans at once  loans four to seven 
may have  been  an indication  that Miss D was having problems managing her money and 
was juggling her finances to make  ends meet. And I note that Miss D was quite often 
repaying her loans before the agreed  term. While I accept this would have saved Miss D 
interest charges,  I think this may equally have been a further suggestion that Miss D was in 
financial difficulty. Miss D has told us she was borrowing from other short-term lenders at the 
same time as Lending Stream so these early repayments could have been an indication 
Miss D was borrowing  elsewhere to make  her loan repayments. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Lending Streams  lending history with Miss D, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream  should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Lending Stream  should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Ref: DRN83806423Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan eight. I say this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Miss D was not managing to 
repay her loans sustainably. Miss D had taken out eight  loans  within eight months. 
So Lending  Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss D was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Ds indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
I appreciate there was a gap between loan seven being repaid and loan eight being 
given. But this was only a gap of two months  and I dont think  this would have been a 
long enough  break  for Lending  Stream to have  assumed that whatever the financial 
difficultly was which had caused  Miss D to take short-term, high-cost credit at the 
outset of the borrowing relationship, had been resolved.  I think  at this point Lending 
Stream ought to have known that Miss D was not likely  borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss D was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
Quite often this was combined with an early repayment of an earlier  loan. Again, and 
like Ive said above, I dont think this borrowing pattern is sustainable. Given  the high-
cost nature of short-term lending I would question why someone would repay a loan 
early, only to come back for further borrowing shortly afterwards. 
Miss D wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending  Stream. 
Loan 25 was taken out 21 months after Miss Ds first. Miss D had paid large  amounts  
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an extended  period.
I think that Miss D lost out because Lending  Stream continued to provide borrowing from 
loan eight onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss D borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ds ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the second  adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about  loans seven  to 25 
and Lending  Stream  should put things right.
Ref: DRN83806424putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss D paid on loans seven to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan seven from Miss Ds credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  eight to 25 should  be removed from  
Miss Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Miss D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ds complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
