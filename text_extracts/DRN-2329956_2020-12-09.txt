The complaint
Mr M complains about the compensation that hes received from Moneybarn No. 1 Limited 
after he rejected a car that had been supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr M under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn 
that he electronically signed in March 2019;
he complained to Moneybarn about some issues with the car and it arranged for the 
car to be inspected by an independent expert in September 2019 who concluded 
that:  on the balance of probability, the vehicle would not have been in a 
compromised state at finance inception - based on the length of time and mileage 
covered since that time;
Moneybarn initially didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint but then agreed in October 2019 
that he could reject the car and it paid him £2,273.36 compensation which it says he 
accepted in full and final settlement;
the compensation was £1,204.36 as a refund of four monthly payments (which it said 
was in lieu of Mr Ms travel expenses), £321 as a refund of the deposit that hed paid, 
£400 and £198 to reimburse him for the cost of repairs to the exhaust and brakes 
and £150 for his distress and inconvenience;
Mr M accepted that payment but complained to this service and says that he should 
also be reimbursed for the following amounts: £450 - new alloy wheels, £30 - locking 
wheel nuts, £47 - bonnet guard, £205 - new tyres, £370 - repairs, £476  taxis, £29 -
wind deflectors, £12 - mud flaps, £135 - bumper trim, £13 - rubber mats, £85  
drivers door respray and £80 - bonnet vents; and that he should also receive more 
compensation for the inconvenience that hes been caused;
our investigator explained in detail why he thought that Moneybarn had reasonably 
resolved things already and that he didnt consider that it should reimburse Mr M for 
any of the additional costs that hed claimed or pay him a higher amount of 
compensation for his distress and inconvenience;
the conditional sale agreement shows that the car had been driven for 107,000 miles 
when it was supplied to Mr M in March 2019 and the experts report recorded its 
mileage as being 113,150 in September 2019  so in about six months Mr M had 
been able to drive more than 6,000 miles in the car;
where a consumer has been able to use a car  even if it wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied  I usually consider that its fair and reasonable for the 
consumer to pay for the use that theyve had from the car  Moneybarn has agreed 
to refund four monthly payments to Mr M, which it says is in lieu of his travel 
expenses, and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to also 
require it to reimburse Mr M for the taxi costs that hes claimed;
Moneybarn has reimbursed Mr M for the cost of the repairs to the exhaust and 
brakes and Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to show that there 
were issues with the cars wheels, tyres and the other items that hes replaced or 
added to the car that caused it not be of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to 
him  so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Moneybarn to reimburse him for any of those costs;
Moneybarn has paid £150 compensation to Mr M for the distress and inconvenience 
that he was caused  these events have clearly caused him distress and 
inconvenience and I sympathise with him for the difficulties that hes been caused 
by the issues with the car - but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable 
for me to require Moneybarn to pay him a higher amount of compensation for that 
distress and inconvenience; and
I consider that Moneybarn acted fairly and reasonably by allowing Mr M to reject the 
car and paying him compensation totalling £2,273.36  so I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to pay him any more 
compensation.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2021.
