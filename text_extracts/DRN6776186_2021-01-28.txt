K822xcomplaint
Mr N complains about the cancellation  fee that hes been charged by Omni Capital Retail 
Finance Limited  for an HGV driving  course that he paid for using a fixed sum loan 
agreement and which he cancelled.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr N electronically signed a fixed sum loan agreement  with Omni Capital in April 
2018 to pay for an HGV driving  course   the loan agreement described the course as 
Category C 5 days, Category C+E 5 days,  Initial  CPC, Pass Protection with a 
specified course provider  the cost of the course was £4,997  and he paid a deposit 
of £50 - so the amount  of the loan was £4,947 which was to be repaid by a payment 
of £145.90 and 47 monthly payments  of £145.94   the interest  rate was 19.9%;
Mr N sent an e-mail to the course provider  29 days  later in which he said that he 
wasnt able to continue with the course due to family circumstances and finances and 
he asked it to stop any further  payments  being made for the course;
a 10% cancellation fee was applied as Mr N hadnt cancelled the course within  the 14 
day cancellation period and Omni Capital also charged interest for five months 
because the course provider  didnt  tell it about  Mr Ns cancellation until September 
2018;
Mr N says that he phoned the course  provider within the cancellation  period  to cancel 
the course and that he shouldnt have to pay any money to it so he complained to 
Omni Capital, and then to this service;
our investigator said that there was no evidence to show  that the course was 
cancelled within the 14 day cancellation  period so the cancellation fee of 10% had 
been applied  in line with the terms and conditions of the training course  but she 
didnt agree that Omni Capital could  add the interest for five months  so the amount 
that Mr N needed to pay to Omni Capital was £525.57;
Mr N says that he called the course  provider to cancel the course and hes being 
punished for its failure to do that so he shouldnt need to pay anything further and the 
on-going issue  has caused him major  health  issues  he also says that hell refuse to 
pay anything more  to Omni Capital;
the course providers  terms  and conditions say that a customer must inform it of the 
cancellation of a course: by a clear  statement (e.g. a letter sent by post,  e-mail  
and/or fax)  Mr N says that he called the course provider to cancel the course and it 
later told him that he needed to do so in writing so he sent it an e-mail  but the 
cancellation wouldnt have been effective until it was made  in writing  and that didnt 
happen until after the cancellation  period had ended;
Ref: DRN67761862the terms and conditions also say that a 10% cancellation  fee would be applied if the 
course was cancelled after the cancellation  period had ended and I consider that its 
fair and reasonable in these circumstance  for Mr N to pay the cancellation  charge;
Im not persuaded that its fair or reasonable for Omni Capital to charge Mr N any 
interest for the period  after his e-mail  was received  and its calculated  that the 
amount that he needs to pay is £525.57; and
I sympathise with Mr N for the health issues  that hes suffering and the other  
difficulties that hes been caused   but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these  circumstances for me to require Omni Capital to further reduce, 
or waive, the cancellation charge  of £525.57   or to take any other  action in response 
to his complaint.
Mr N says that hell refuse to pay anything  more to Omni Capital  but if he doesnt pay it the 
£525.27, or make an arrangement to do so, I consider it to be more likely than not that it will 
take further action  to recover that amount from him, to the extent that its legally entitled to 
do so. I suggest that he contacts Omni  Capital to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement to pay it £525.27. Its required  to respond to any financial difficulties that hes 
experiencing positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Ns complaint in part and I order Omni Capital Retail Finance 
Limited to reduce the amount of the cancellation charge that its made  to Mr N to £525.57.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2021.
