The complaint
Mrs G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt refund money paid 
for a membership fee.
What happened
Mrs G signed up for a one-month trial with an online membership organisation. It ran from 17 
November 2020 to 17 December 2020. On 17 December 2020, PayPal debited her account 
with the annual membership fee of £383.88, of which £157.99 was transferred from her 
credit card account  so the balance of £225.89 was outstanding on her PayPal account. 
Her credit card refunded the amount of £157.99.
Mrs G complained. She said shed cancelled the membership on 17 December 2020  and 
so PayPal shouldnt have paid the money out. Her credit card had refunded the money, so 
PayPal should also. The terms of the trial said she could cancel on or before 17 December 
2020  which she did.
PayPal rejected her claim. She had set up a billing agreement in favour of the merchant (the 
membership organisation) and hadnt cancelled it in time.
Mrs G brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said PayPal had acted fairly. Mrs G had 
cancelled the membership offer on 17 December 2020  at the end of the free trial period - 
but by that time, the money had been paid by PayPal. The billing agreement with PayPal 
said that Mrs G authorised the merchant to collect payments from her PayPal account  and 
thats what had happened. He could see from the terms of the membership offer that it said 
the trial should be cancelled at least one day before the end of the months trial, and after 
that the auto-renewal billing might come into effect.
Mrs G asked that an ombudsman looked at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs G says that because she cancelled her membership subscription on the day it was due 
to be converted into an annual agreement, PayPal shouldnt have paid out the money to the 
merchant. I can see that Mrs G cancelled the billing agreement with PayPal at 9.20 am on 
17 December 2020  but the money was paid to the merchant earlier, at 8.55 am. PayPal 
paid £383.88, of which £225.89 came from Mrs Gs PayPal balance and £157.99 came from 
her bank credit card.
Mrs G had set up a billing agreement with PayPal  which said that the merchant could take 
money from her PayPal account while the billing agreement was in place. And  while the 
billing agreement was in place, PayPal had to pay the money to the merchant if the 
merchant asked for it  so they did. Effectively, the merchant pulled the money from Mrs 
Gs PayPal account. PayPals terms and conditions for billing agreements say this is OK: 
Billing agreement payments: You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the 
same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.
When you enter into a billing agreement:
You authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient 
determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of 
goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).
You instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named 
recipient(s) direct(s) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.
Mrs G has said that her membership offer said she could cancel up to or on the day of 
renewal. And  that she cancelled it on 17 December 2020. But  thats a matter between 
her and the membership organisation, not PayPal. PayPal wouldnt have any knowledge of 
the terms of her arrangement with the membership organisation  they could only see that 
the billing agreement was still live and in place. The key point here is that Mrs G had to 
cancel the billing agreement with PayPal for the payment to be cancelled  but she didnt do 
this in time. And so  PayPal acted correctly and fairly in this case.
The only course of action that Mrs G now has is to take the matter up with the membership 
organisation  who debited her PayPal account. 
Mrs G raised a dispute with her credit card for the amount paid on it, and the bank refunded 
that. Ive not seen exactly what happened there  but as it looks like her credit card issuer 
initiated a chargeback  a process whereby they asked for the money back from the 
membership organisation. Typically, its used where theres a dispute about faulty goods 
bought, or services paid for and not received. It doesnt always result in a refund  as its a 
discretionary process. We considered whether PayPal couldve done this and asked them  
but they told us that the chargeback process is only something offered by credit card 
issuers, not by PayPal. 
So, and while this will be disappointing for Mrs G, I wont be asking PayPal to do anymore 
here.
 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2021.
