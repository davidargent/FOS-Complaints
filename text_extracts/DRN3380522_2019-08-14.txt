K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund him for faulty goods he 
purchased using his PayPal account.
To settle matters  Mr D would like a refund of the cost of the goods.
background
I set out the background  to Mr Ds complaint in my provisional decision, a copy  extract of 
which is attached  and forms part of this final decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I was proposing to partly  uphold Mr Ds 
complaint.
I invited the parties to respond  to my provisional  decision. PayPal  responded  to say it had 
nothing further to add.
Mr D responded in detail. Ive summarised his main concerns below;-
he says my provisional decision incorrectly said that he returned the item to the retailer 
for a refund whereas he returned the item to the retailer for a replacement.
he says my provisional decision doesnt  address  that the item wasnt fit for purpose; 
and
the adjudicators  view dealt with a refund and compensation for PayPals lack of 
service whereas my provisional decision deals only with the latter.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I thank Mr D and PayPal for their 
responses to my provisional  decision.
Ive now finished  my review. Ive thought  carefully about everything Mr D has said following 
my provisional decision.
Mr D has drawn  to my attention that I incorrectly stated that he returned the item to the 
retailer for a refund when he instead returned the item to the retailer for a replacement.  I 
apologise for this but Id like to reassure him that this doesnt affect my reasoning.
I accept that my provisional  decision didnt refer to Mr Ds concerns that the item wasnt fit 
for purpose  - as it fell apart after one wash. However, I think  that whether or not the item 
was fit for purpose would also fall outside PayPal  Buyer Protection.
PayPals Buyer Protection provisions allow a buyer who has used PayPal to pay for goods 
to ask PayPal for a refund  where goods  are significantly  not as described (SNAD). The 
relevant part of the Buyer Protection  provisions  section 13.8b, says that a product is not 
treated as SNAD if your  purchase was correctly  described but did not meet your 
expectations.
Whether or not the item Mr D purchased  was fit for purpose must be treated in the same  
way as the comments I made in my provisional decision about whether  or not the item was 
of satisfactory quality.
Ref: DRN33805222Thats because questions about an item not being  fit for purpose  or not being of satisfactory 
quality are issues that go beyond the way the item was described. Whether or not a product 
is durable  and therefore whether  or not it was of satisfactory quality or fit for purpose  are 
issues about the item not meeting Mr Ds expectations. These are matters that arent 
covered by PayPals  Buyer Protection. Thats because under PayPals Buyer  Protection if a 
product is correctly described  but fails to meet the buyers expectations then its not treated 
as SNAD and therefore its not covered by PayPals Buyer  Protection.
I realise Mr D is also concerned that the adjudicator recommended that Mr D should  receive  
a refund as well as compensation  for PayPals lack of service whereas  my provisional  
decision dealt only with the latter. Thats because I dont consider that the issues  Mr D had 
with the item fall within the scope of PayPals Buyer Protection. So I think  PayPal acted fairly 
when it rejected Mr Ds claim.
Ive looked carefully  at the additional  information  provided by Mr D but Im afraid it doesnt 
change my conclusions  about whats happened  taking  all the facts  and circumstances into 
account. It follows that I have no reason to depart from my provisional decision.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. And I direct
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay Mr D £100  compensation  for the inconvenience  
caused to him due to the poor service he received when he brought his claim for a refund 
under the PayPals Buyer Protection.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 September  2019.

complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund him for faulty goods he 
purchased using his PayPal account.
To settle  matters Mr D would like a refund  of the cost of the goods.
background
Mr D purchased a piece  of sports clothing in early May 2018 for £110.78 using his PayPal account.  
After one wear and one wash he says the outfit started to bobble and the stitching came loose. He 
complained to the retailer and was initially  told to return the items for a refund. Mr D did this but the 
retailer didnt refund him and it returned  to the items to Mr D without reason. So he asked PayPal 
for a refund.
PayPal rejected his claim. They didnt believe the problems Mr D had fell within  their Buyer  Protection  
Scheme.
Unhappy with PayPals response Mr D brought his claim to this service. Our adjudicator  didnt think  
PayPal had conducted a fair and reasonable investigation into Mr Ds complaint because  it gave no 
reason why his claim was rejected initially.  In further emails PayPal suggested the item Mr D had 
purchased matched the description given  by the retailer  so PayPal didnt consider  that the item was 
significantly not as described and therefore it wasnt required to make a refund under  its Buyer 
Protection policy.
The adjudicator thought that as the item was advertised as a mid-level product then it should  be 
of mid-level quality and able to withstand a reasonable  amount of use. He didnt think  PayPal had 
asked additional questions to find out what the item was, how long Mr D had had it or what had 
been discussed with the retailer before  it reached  its decision to reject Mr Ds claim. And he 
thought this had negatively affected  the outcome of Mr Ds complaint.
The adjudicator recommended that PayPal  should  refund the cost of the item, arrange  for the item to 
be collected from Mr D and to pay £100 compensation to Mr D for the trouble and inconvenience  
caused.
PayPal disagrees  with the adjudicators view and has asked  for an ombudsmans decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal operates a Buyer Protection Scheme. This provides that in certain circumstances  a buyer 
who has used PayPal to pay for goods  can ask PayPal for a refund. Broadly this is where  goods are 
significantly not as described (SNAD)  or if goods paid for are not received (NR). However  PayPals 
Buyer Protection  Scheme doesnt offer consumers  the same protection  a consumer would have if 
goods were  bought online using a credit card.
The Buyer Protection Scheme is stated to apply  in addition to any statutory  rights Mr D has against 
the retailer  - for example,  if the goods  arent of satisfactory quality  or if theyre  not fit for purpose.
I must explain  that my role isnt to make a finding about whether or not the goods supplied to Mr D 
were SNAD or whether  or not they were of satisfactory quality. Instead my role is to decide if PayPal 
treated Mr D fairly.
Ref: DRN33805224Initially PayPal rejected  Mr Ds claim without giving a reason. Later,  it explained itd rejected Mr Ds 
claim because  hed returned the item in a different condition than when it was despatched  so it 
couldnt say whether or not the item was significantly different to that originally  described. Mr D says 
it was impossible to return the item in its original state because, after wearing it once and washing it, 
the item started to fall apart.
From the information Ive seen Mr D doesnt dispute that he received the sports  clothing  he ordered 
so this suggests  to me that the item he purchased met its general description. 
Mr Ds complaint goes further than this - he says the item wasnt as described because  after hed 
worn it once and washed it, the item started  to fall apart and it wasnt described  as wear once.
Ive considered Mr Ds arguments carefully  and Ive also taken into account  the adjudicators point 
that the product was described as mid level. But I dont think it would  be fair to make PayPal liable  
for the subsequent problems  Mr D experienced. The relevant part of the Buyer  Protection  Scheme, 
section 13.8b, says that a product is not treated as SNAD  if your purchase was correctly  described 
but did not meet your expectations. Im satisfied the issue of whether or not the clothing purchased 
by Mr D was durable is a wider question about whether  or not the product was of satisfactory quality - 
and this is something that falls outside PayPals  Buyer Protection Scheme - as the product didnt 
meet Mr Ds expectations.
In describing the products as mid-level I think a reasonable  person would understand this to mean  
that the performance of the sports clothing  is of a mid-level item. For example, that its lightweight  or 
that moisture is wicked away quickly.  Im not aware  that Mr D complains  that the product didnt 
perform as hed wanted  when he wore it. Instead  in his emails to PayPal he says the clothing wasnt 
of satisfactory  quality.
The issues about whether  or not the product is of satisfactory fall outside PayPals Buyer 
Protection Scheme for the reasons Ive explained.  So these sorts of issues should be dealt  with 
between Mr D and the retailer. It follows that I wont  be asking PayPal to refund Mr D the cost of the 
clothing he purchased.
However, I agree that Mr D received poor service from PayPal. Under 13.1 of the User Agreement, 
PayPal is entitled to make  a final decision on any problem  raised by a buyer in respect of a purchase 
paid for using PayPal in its sole discretion. But this doesnt mean  PayPal can do whatever it likes.  It 
has to use its discretion  fairly.
I cant look into PayPals complaints handling  but I can look at how it dealt with Mr D when he asked 
PayPal to refund him. PayPal didnt  explain  at first why it was rejecting Mr Ds claim. PayPals  email 
in early August simply said it wasnt able to decide  in Mr Ds favour.  And it didnt ask him for any 
further information about  what  hed bought or how long hed had the item.  So I think  its customer  
service should  have  been  better.
In summary  I dont intend to require PayPal to reimburse  the cost of the item  and nor do I require  it 
to collect the item from Mr D. But due to the poor customer service I consider it appropriate for 
PayPal to pay £100  compensation  for the trouble caused to Mr D for the way it dealt with his claim 
for a refund under PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme.
I realise my decision will be a disappointment  to Mr D as the seller is located overseas and it may be 
difficult for him to obtain  a refund. But for the reasons given I think  this is a fair outcome.
