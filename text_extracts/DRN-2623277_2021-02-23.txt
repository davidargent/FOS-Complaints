The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) misled him about a loan 
application and says it didnt reduce his overdraft limit.
What happened
Mr S says he tried to reduce his borrowing and took out a loan to repay his debts. He says 
he borrowed money from NatWest in July 2019 for £10,000 and at the time asked it to 
reduce his overdraft facility to zero. Mr S says he left the United Kingdom but, on his return, 
realised NatWest hadnt reduced his overdraft facility. He says he took out a further NatWest 
loan in October 2019 to buy a car and says he was told he could consolidate that loan with 
the first loan after three payments were made. But was later told he would need to wait for 
18 months before an application could be made and says he was misadvised. Mr S says he 
has been offered compensation and says NatWest has accepted misleading him. He would 
like either the interest removed from both loan accounts or the second loan written off.
NatWest wrote to Mr S and upheld his complaint in part. It says Mr S didnt complete the 
application to reduce his overdraft facility and has offered £100 for any misleading 
information. NatWest has told us that it doesnt have any evidence that Mr S was given 
incorrect information about making three payments before a consolidation application could 
be made.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest had dealt fairly with it. 
The investigator thought Mr S hadnt completed the overdraft application and that there 
wasnt any record of him being told about the consolidation payment option after the third 
payment. The investigator thought it up to NatWest to decide on its lending process and the 
£100 offer fair and reasonable.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says NatWest has accepted that it misled him, and he will 
have to pay over £1,800 in interest.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint. I appreciate Mr S will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked at NatWests records and can see that Mr S attempted to reduce his overdraft 
facility to £750 and not zero as he told us. I can also see that the application wasnt 
completed by Mr S and so I cant fairly hold NatWest responsible for that or for the spending 
that took place on his account.
I have listened to the call between NatWest and Mr S when the second loan was taken out 
and I think that is the crucial call as it was during that call that the loan was agreed. Im 
satisfied that Mr S asked NatWest about taking out one loan to use to repay his debts and 
buy a car and that NatWest gave him the calculations. I think Mr S thought that his existing 
loan had a lower interest rate than the one he was offered and asked NatWest to provide a 
quote for just a car loan.
Im satisfied that NatWest made clear what the interest rate would be, and that Mr S agreed 
to the loan terms and conditions. Im also satisfied that during that call there was no mention 
of the possibility of a consolidation loan in the future and/or after three payments were made. 
So, I dont think Mr S was misled by NatWest and that it was his choice to agree to the loan 
and in doing so agreed to the loan terms and conditions. I also think Mr S didnt have to 
agree to those terms and conditions and it was made clear to him what the interest rate and 
repayment in total would be.
I have looked at NatWests records and I cant see any mention after the loan was taken out 
about a consolidation loan and about its possibility after three payments. I have made clear 
that I cant fairly conclude that the loan was mis-sold when Mr S agreed to the terms and 
conditions and during the call in which the loan was taken out there was no mention of that.
I appreciate NatWests final response letters are not clear about that issue, and it has offered 
Mr S a payment of £100. I think on balance at the time NatWest sent those letters, it hadnt 
investigated this complaint in detail. And its of course up to Mr S to decide if he wishes to 
accept that offer.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt acted unfairly or made a mistake about Mr Ss two 
main complaints about the loan and the overdraft. And so, I cant fairly order NatWest to 
either remove the interest on one or both loans or write off the second loan.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2021.
