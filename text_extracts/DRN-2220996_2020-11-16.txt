The complaint
Mrs H says Evergreen Finance London Limited  trading as MoneyBoat - irresponsibly lent 
to her.
What happened
This complaint is about three short-term loans MoneyBoat provided to Mrs H between          
April and October 2019. Mrs Hs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Highest 
Repayment*
1 12/04/2019 12/04/2019 2 £400.00 £247.24
2 18/07/2019 22/08/2019 6 £500.00 £139.65
3 31/10/2019 Outstanding 2 £400.00 £247.24
At the time of writing this decision, loan 3 remains outstanding.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Hs complaint and thought the loans from loan 2 
onwards shouldnt have been given because proportionate checks would have shown Mrs H 
was struggling to manage her money. MoneyBoat disagreed and asked for the complaint to 
be reviewed by an ombudsman. So, the matter has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think 
less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish 
whether Mrs H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mrs Hs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why.
Our adjudicator thought MoneyBoat had carried out proportionate checks for loan 1. Mrs H 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about this loan, I wont be making any 
further findings on it. 
I think MoneyBoat ought to have realised that Mrs H wouldnt have been able to make her 
repayments for loan two sustainably without taking out more lending. I can see MoneyBoat 
did income/expenditure and credit checks on Mrs H before it lent her loan 2. And I can see 
that MoneyBoat has provided its findings from those checks, including the reports from the 
credit checks, to us. 
Having reviewed all of this, I think the information the credit check showed ought to have 
prompted MoneyBoat to verify what Mrs H was telling it  such as asking for copies of her 
bank statements. 
The credit check reports show that Mrs H already had several outstanding debts including 
other short-term loans as well as longer term loans. There had also been several new 
accounts opened in the six months prior to her taking out loan 2 as well a number of 
searches. This information was apparent each time MoneyBoat did a credit check. So, it was 
aware from the information it has provided, that it was likely Mrs H would be unable to 
sustainably repay not just loan 2 but any subsequent loans. I think this was shown by the 
fact loan 3 remains outstanding.  
Had MoneyBoat done proportionate checks and reviewed her bank statements, its likely to 
have seen that Mrs H was borrowing from several other short-term lenders. For example, in 
June 2019 alone, Mrs H was either borrowing or repaying loans from nine other short-term 
lenders. And the repayments for these loans would have been increasing her monthly 
outgoings. I think this was a clear indication that Mrs H was in a debt cycle and relying upon borrowing 
to repay borrowing. So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 2 and 3 and 
MoneyBoat should put things right.
Putting things right
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt MoneyBoat should buy it back if MoneyBoat is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat cant buy the debt back, then 
MoneyBoat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) MoneyBoat should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs H towards 
interest, fees and charges on loan 2, not including anything MoneyBoat has already 
refunded.
B) MoneyBoat should calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by 
Mrs H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs H originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 3, and 
treat any repayments made by Mrs H as though they had been repayments of the principal 
on this loan. If this results in Mrs H having made overpayments then MoneyBoat should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
MoneyBoat should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on loan 3. If this results in a surplus, then the 
surplus should be paid to Mrs H. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then 
MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs H. MoneyBoat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal MoneyBoat has already written-
off.
E) MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Hs credit file in 
relation to loans 2 and 3. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat must 
give Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
I partially uphold this complaint and Evergreen Finance London Limited should put things 
right as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2020.
