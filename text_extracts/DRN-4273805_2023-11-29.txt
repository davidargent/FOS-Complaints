The complaint
M complains about difficulties completing a business profile review with National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest). 
What happened
Ms director, Mr J, has explained that it has held a business account with NatWest since 
2011 and had previously completed a business profile review in 2018, submitting documents 
in paper format. Mr J says the process was quick and straight forward to complete. 
In March 2022 NatWest contacted M and explained it needed to carry out a business profile 
review. This time, NatWest asked for documents to be submitted via its online business 
banking facility. A follow up request was issued in April 2022 reminding Mr J to complete the 
review online. On 9 June 2022 NatWest contacted M and thanked Mr J for starting the 
review process. NatWest advised further information was required, including an Ownership 
Structure Chart. NatWest advised guidance on how to proceed could be found online. 
Mr Js told us he spoke with someone at NatWest in July 2022 and was told M had complied 
with the information required. NatWest says it has no record of that call and that Mr J hadnt 
submitted everything required to complete its review. 
On 6 July 2022 NatWest wrote to M again and confirmed the information noted in its 
previous correspondence remained outstanding. NatWests letter explained that if the 
information wasnt received by 5 August 2022 it would restrict Ms account. On 5 August 
2022 NatWest wrote to M to say it had applied the account restrictions as the information it 
needed hadnt been supplied. Mr J was asked to call. NatWests contact notes show it tried 
to call Mr J on 8 August 2022 and 24 August 2022 without success. 
On 27 October 2022 Mr J wrote to NatWest and explained hed been abroad when its letter 
of 5 August 2022 had been received. Mr J raised concerns that NatWest had restricted the 
use of Ms business account and the funds it held. Mr J explained that the restrictions meant 
payments, including direct debits, werent made which had caused difficulties and charges to 
be incurred. 
No response to Mr Js letter was received so he called NatWest on 30 November 2022. 
During the call, the account restrictions were lifted. On 1 December 2022 Mr J spoke with an 
agent at NatWest and, between them attempted to complete the outstanding Ownership 
Structure Chart. But the chart submitted wasnt right and rejected. An appointment for Mr J 
to speak with an agent on 12 December 2022 at 12pm was made. 
An agent at NatWest called Mr J around an hour later than was promised. But Mr Js told us 
he didnt feel comfortable answering the security questions asked so the appointment didnt 
continue. Mr J called back the following day and the Ownership Structure Chart was 
completed and submitted to the relevant team. The account restrictions were removed by 
NatWest on 14 December 2022. 
NatWest issued a final response to Ms complaint on 20 December 2022 and said its 
account had been correctly restricted as not all the information required to complete the 
business profile review had been supplied. NatWest advised it had written to confirm its 
intention to restrict Ms account if the information wasnt provided. NatWest didnt uphold Ms 
complaint and said that Mr J had the option of referring it to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service. 
Mr J wrote back to NatWest on 3 January 2023 and asked a number of questions, explaining 
he didnt feel its final response fully answered Ms complaint. On 8 March 2023 NatWest 
wrote to M to confirm its business profile review was complete but no response to Mr Js 
letter was issued. Mr J contacted NatWest again to see whether a response to his letter 
would be issued. NatWest sent Mr J an email on 20 March 2023 confirming it had issued its 
final response on 20 December 2022 and M had been given referral rights for the Financial 
Ombudsman Service if Mr J remained dissatisfied. 
An investigator at this service looked at Ms complaint. They thought NatWest had 
reasonably restricted Ms account following requests for information to complete the 
business profile review. The investigator didnt agree that NatWest had made mistakes or 
treated M unfairly and didnt ask it to take any further action. 
On Ms behalf, Mr J asked to appeal and said NatWests initial request was for a certificate 
of incorporation for a Ltd company (D) that formed part of the ownership structure of M. Mr J 
has explained this was submitted to NatWest. Mr J also said that the work required to 
resolve the account issues caused by NatWests restrictions had taken around 15 hours to 
complete which had caused a loss to M. Mr J asked to appeal Ms complaint so its been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under.
In response to the investigator, Mr J said that he had complied with NatWests requirements 
by submitting a certificate of incorporation for D, the limited company that forms part of the 
ownership structure for M. Mr J says this was confirmed over the phone as being the 
information NatWest required to complete its business profile review. But NatWest has told 
us it has no record of giving Mr J that advice and explained it had been requesting an 
Ownership Structure Chart from M since the business profile review process started. Ive 
looked at the available information to see what I think is most likely to have occurred. 
I can see NatWests initial correspondence asked Mr J to log in and start the business profile 
review for M. On 9 June 2022 NatWest emailed Mr J and said he needed to supply two more 
pieces of information. The first were details to help NatWest verify the identity of the 
individuals controlling M. The second request was for an Ownership Structure Chart to be 
supplied. NatWest says it needed this due to the way Ms ownership is structured. NatWest 
sent Mr J a follow up email on 7 July 2022, reiterating its request for the same information and explaining the account would be restricted if the request wasnt complied with. Which is 
what NatWest went on to do on 5 August 2022. 
I understand Mr Js told us he was informed the information hed already submitted was 
sufficient. But NatWest has explained theres no record of a call of that nature. And its 
pointed out that the certificate of incorporation Mr Js told us he was asked to submit wasnt 
the information it had requested in its correspondence with M. 
Where the events of a complaint are disputed by the parties involved Ill base my decision on 
the balance of probabilities. That is, what I consider most likely to have occurred taking all 
the available information into account. Im sorry to disappoint Mr J, but I havent seen 
anything that shows NatWest misled him or advised that its business profile review had been 
completed before the account restriction was put in place on 5 August 2022. From what Ive 
seen, I think its more likely that NatWest still required Mr J to submit further information on 
Ms behalf, which is why it continued to request he make contact to complete the business 
profile review. 
NatWest applied an account restriction on 5 August 2022 which meant Ms account wasnt 
making payments. Mr Js explained that because he was abroad for an extended period he 
received NatWests letter on his return which led him to wrote to it on 27 October 2022. 
Whilst I understand Mr J feels the restriction of Ms account was unreasonable, its a step 
NatWests terms and conditions allow it to take in the circumstances. I dont doubt the 
account restriction caused a lot of inconvenience to M, but I havent found evidence to 
support it was unfairly or incorrectly applied by NatWest. 
The account restriction was removed when Mr J spoke with NatWest on 1 December 2022 
but reapplied a short time later as the business profile review process wasnt completed. 
Once Mr J was able to go over the ownership structure of M with an agent on 13 December 
2022 and NatWests records were updated, the restriction was removed. Im satisfied that 
was fair as M had complied with the business profile review. 
Ive listened to various calls Mr J had with NatWest on Ms behalf. I understand why Mr J 
found the process frustrating and longwinded. But I felt the agents Mr J spoke with were 
professional and sought to help. I agree there were some service issues, like the promised 
call back on 12 December 2022 being an hour later than agreed. But overall, I didnt find 
evidence to show poor service. During the call on 1 December 2022 the agent Mr J spoke 
with tried to assist. But they werent from the team that completes the business profile 
reviews so whilst they attempted to help Mr J update the ownership structure chart, they 
werent able to do so. However, the agent arranged for another member of staff from the 
relevant team to call Mr J on 12 December 2022 at 12pm. Im satisfied that was reasonable 
in the circumstances. 
Once Mr J spoke with the relevant team on 13 December 2022 all the information required 
was submitted and subsequently approved. The account restriction was removed the 
following day. Im satisfied that removing the account restriction within 24 hours of receiving 
the final pieces of information required to complete the business profile review was 
reasonable. 
NatWest issued its final response to M on 20 December 2022 and explained that if Mr J 
remained dissatisfied he had the right to refer the complaint to this service. Mr J sent a 
detailed letter, requesting a substantial amount of additional comment, on 3 January 2023. 
But NatWest went on to explain it had already issued its final response to Ms complaint on 
20 December 2022 and wasnt looking to correspond further on the matter. I understand 
Mr J wanted a more comprehensive response and explanation from NatWest in relation to 
Ms complaint. But once a business issues a final response and includes referral rights to this service its not obliged to continue corresponding. Im satisfied that NatWests letter 
dated 20 December 2022 confirmed it was its final response to Ms complaint and how to 
refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service. I havent been persuaded that 
NatWest acted unfairly when it declined to provide further comment. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr J as I can see how strongly he feels in this matter. But the 
information provided by both parties shows NatWest consistently asked for an Ownership 
Structure Chart to be supplied going back to when the business profile review started. And 
Im satisfied that once that information was supplied by M, NatWest completed its review 
without unreasonable delay. I appreciate the account restrictions caused M a reasonable 
level of inconvenience but I havent been persuaded NatWest acted unfairly or outside the 
terms and conditions of the business account. For the reasons Ive given above, I havent 
been persuaded to uphold Ms complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2024.
