The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly recorded a default on 
his credit file after it closed his current account. 
What happened
On 10 September 2019 NatWest wrote to Mr R and explained it had taken the decision to 
end its banking relationship with him. NatWest said Mr R had 60 days to make new banking 
arrangements and repay any outstanding balances. NatWests letter asked Mr R to contact it 
immediately if he wasnt able to repay the money he owed. Mr R has told us he didnt 
receive NatWests letter. 
As the outstanding balance wasnt repaid, the account was passed to NatWests recoveries 
team. Mr R went on to agree a payment plan of Â£25 per month. During this period, the 
account was recorded as being in arrears with the credit reference agencies. In April 2020 
NatWest defaulted the account and reported its decision to the credit reference agencies. 
Mr R complained and NatWest responded on 9 June 2020. NatWest agreed it had made a 
mistake and waited too long to default the account. NatWest says that should have been 
done in December 2019, not April 2020. NatWest said it would arrange for the default to be 
back dated to 7 December 2019 and remove the arrears information reported after that date. 
Mr R referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. She thought 
NatWests decision to default the account was reasonable and that it had dealt with Mr Rs 
complaint fairly so didnt ask it to do anything else. Mr R asked to appeal so his complaint 
has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do understand why Mr R is upset and that this situation will have an impact on his credit file 
for several years. But I havent found that NatWest made an error by taking the decision to 
close his accounts and report a default on Mr Rs credit file. As there are a number of issues, 
Ill deal with each in turn. 
NatWest says it reviewed Mr Rs accounts and took the decision to close them after giving 
60 days notice. NatWest also says the overdraft was repayable on demand. Ive checked 
the account terms and they say NatWest can chose to close an account for any reason as 
long as it gives 60 days notice. NatWest can also request repayment of an overdraft at any 
time. NatWest wrote to Mr R on 10 September 2019 and closed the account 60 days later. 
Im satisfied the account terms allowed NatWest to close Mr Rs accounts and ask him to 
repay the overdraft. 
I understand that crux of this case is that Mr R says he didnt know about NatWests 
intention to close his account as he didnt receive its letter. NatWest has sent a copy of the 
letter along with evidence of the correspondence it sent Mr R. I appreciate Mr R didnt 
receive the letter, but Im satisfied the letter is correctly addressed and that NatWest wrote to 
him as it claims. 
I havent found that NatWest made any errors by taking the decision to close Mr Rs 
accounts and request repayment of his overdraft. As Ive said above, Im also satisfied 
NatWest sent Mr R the required 60 day closure letter as it claims. I havent found anything 
that shows NatWest made an error or treated Mr R unfairly when it decided to close his 
account. 
NatWest says it waited too long to default the account and has taken steps to remove the 
arrears information it reported in 2020 and back date the default to 7 December 2019. I 
agree with NatWest that the 7 December 2019 default date more accurately reflects what 
happened. NatWest has sent evidence to show it has updated the credit reference agencies 
and that the default balance is reported as reducing in line with Mr Rs payments. Whilst I 
agree NatWest shouldve applied the default on 7 December 2019, Im satisfied it has now 
taken steps to correct the error and removed the arrears information. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr R but I havent found any evidence that NatWest has made a 
mistake or treated him unfairly. NatWest acted in line with the account terms when it decided 
to end its banking relationship with Mr R. And Im satisfied it wrote to him with its decision on 
10 September 2019. As Im satisfied NatWest has dealt with Mr Rs complaint fairly, Im not 
telling it to take any further action.  
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
