The complaint
Ms M says NewDay Ltd, trading as Opus, has mis-handled her credit card account.
What happened
Ms M paid off the balance of her credit card account in April 2018. The following day 
NewDay received a further payment of £100, leaving her account in credit by £124.60.
Ms M said NewDay told her it could only refund the credit amount to her to another credit 
card, which she said wasnt possible as she didnt hold any other credit cards at the time. 
She wanted payment of the outstanding amount (plus interest) to be made by cheque, 
together with clarification as to why NewDay felt she was due a refund of £24.60 rather than 
£124.60.
Dissatisfied with NewDays response on the matter, Ms M brought her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked into the complaint and didnt recommend that it 
should be upheld. In summary, they felt NewDay had treated Ms M fairly overall and that it 
didnt need to do anything further to resolve the complaint.
Because Ms M didnt agree with the investigators findings, the complaint was passed to me 
to review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute that Ms M paid off her account balance in April 2018 or that her account 
was left in credit for several years. The main issues for me to consider are whether NewDay 
was to blame for any delays in the refund being paid and whether its offered to refund the 
correct amount.
Having considered the issues, Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Im satisfied from the information provided that NewDay processed two separate refunds to 
Ms M in September 2018. One was for £100 and the other was for £24.60. It seems the 
refund of £100 was successfully paid into the account for which NewDay held details. I dont 
think it was unreasonable for NewDay to use the account details that it held in the 
circumstances. 
Unfortunately, the refund for £24.60 was rejected by Ms Ms bank and the credit remained 
on Ms Ms NewDay account. I cant see that NewDay was at fault for this second refund not 
being paid. I recognise Ms M would like to know why the refund wasnt paid. Its open for 
Ms M to contact her bank for more information about that if shed like  but I cant see that 
NewDay did anything wrong in this regard.
Ive seen copies of Ms Ms NewDay account statements from 2018 to 2023 and I can see 
that they show the account was in credit for £24.60. So, Im satisfied Ms M was aware, or 
ought to have been aware, that the account was in credit and by how much. That being the 
case, I dont consider that NewDay was responsible for the delay between the unsuccessful 
attempt to refund the amount in September 2018 and the date she complained to NewDay 
about the issue in 2023. Which in turns means Im not persuaded any interest should be 
added to any refund of the credit balance.
NewDays confirmed that it cant issue a cheque for the credit balance refund but that it can 
transfer the remaining credit to a bank account of Ms Ms choice. If Ms M hasnt done so 
already, she can provide those details direct to NewDay. 
My final decision
For the reasons given, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2023.
