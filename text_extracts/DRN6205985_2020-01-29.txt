Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  have been upheld in respect of loans  6 to 9. 
Sunny didnt agree with that view. It said that it undertook various checks around whether it 
was right to lend to Miss P. It said that it had undertaken checks  each time Miss P applied 
for a loan and the repayments  appeared affordable. It said our adjudicator  was not correct  
when she said the borrowing  had remained the same. It drew my attention to the differing 
amounts set out above. There was no outstanding balance on any of Miss Ps loan 
accounts, which indicated  to Sunny that no detriment was caused by this borrowing. 
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN62059852But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan repayments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication  a 
consumer could sustainably make their repay their loans. But it doesnt  automatically follow  
this is the case.  This is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint. Miss P didnt dispute our adjudicators view 
about loans 1 to 5. In light of that, I havent  considered what  happened with these loans any 
further.  
Ive looked carefully  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss P with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen  that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. If it was, Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ps case, I think our adjudicator was right and 
that this point was reached by loan 6. At this point Sunny should have realised Miss P was 
not managing  to repay her loans sustainably. Miss P had taken out six loans  in just over two 
months. After repaying loans 1 to 3, she took a new loan for £250  the next day to be repaid 
over another six months. Another  loan was taken out four days later.  She applied for Loan 6 
five days after repaying loans 1 to 3.  At this stage, Sunny ought to have realised  it was more 
likely than not Miss P was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous 
loan was leaving in her finances  and that her overall indebtedness was increasing.
As I said above, in its response to our adjudicator,  Sunny said she was wrong to conclude  
Miss Ps borrowing had remained the same.  But looking at the evidence before me, loan 1 
Ref: DRN62059853was for £150  and loan 6 was for the same  amount. So I think  our adjudicator was quite right 
to say that the loan amount had not changed.  Again, by the time Miss P applied for loan 6, it 
should have been clear  to Sunny that Miss P was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in their income,  but to meet  an ongoing need. In effect,  Miss P had paid large 
amounts of interest  to service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
With all of this in mind, I think that Miss P lost out because Sunny continued to provide 
borrowing from loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans that Miss P borrowed was likely to have  had negative  
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 9 Sunny  will need  to take action  to put 
things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges paid on loans  6 to 9.
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 9 should be removed from 
Miss Ps credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited must  put things right for Miss P as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 February  2020.
