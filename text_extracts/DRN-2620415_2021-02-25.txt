The complaint
Mr E complains that NewDay Ltd didnt help him with a dispute on his card. Then he said it 
put markers on his card accounts which caused his credit score to drop.
What happened
Mr E said he rang NewDay about a problem he had with an airline ticket. Mr E said the
adviser he spoke to was rude and unhelpful. Mr E told us that he raised a complaint about
the agent, then some time later he found that he had markers on his credit file. Mr E told us
that he had asked NewDay to remove these, and it took markers off one of the three cards
he held with NewDay, but put these markers on the other two accounts.
Mr E said hed experienced poor service, and his credit file had been affected. He wanted
NewDay to fix his credit file, and pay £1,000 in compensation.
NewDay said it didnt think its agent had been rude. And it didnt think the markers on Mr Es
file would affect his credit rating. But when this complaint came to us, it listened to the call
Mr E had with it again, and it said that it thought it shouldve offered to make a chargeback
request for Mr E. It didnt think that would be likely to have been successful, but it still
thought it shouldve made the offer. It offered to pay Mr E £75 to make up for that.
NewDay said no adverse information has been recorded on any of Mr Es NewDay card
accounts. There were query markers on two of his accounts, which were recorded as part of
this complaint. NewDay said that doesnt have an adverse effect on credit file information.
NewDay said the markers would be removed once the complaint is resolved.
NewDay said it had sent Mr E the call recording he wanted. It couldnt send this in an
alternative digital format.
Mr E didnt want to accept NewDays offer. He was adamant that the markers NewDay had
put onto his credit file had caused his credit score to drop dramatically.
Our investigator asked NewDay to take the dispute markers off Mr Es credit file. It then did
so.
Mr E said that his credit score was now going back up, but he then told us markers were still
on his account.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that the markers
had affected Mr E adversely, because he hadnt applied for credit while they were on his
credit file. But she said that query markers being on Mr Es account would have made it
seem like he either had a missed or late payment query for some time. She said that wasnt
clear, and was mis-leading.
Our investigator said NewDay should have looked into the issues raised thoroughly and
removed the markers on the cards as they didnt accurately reflect the how the account was
being managed and were misleading. Because it hadnt, she said NewDay should pay Mr E
an additional £75, making his total compensation £150.
NewDay said it wouldnt pay more. It said that when it gets a complaint, a hold is placed on
the account, to stop action like collections activity and the account being sold, whilst the
complaint is under review. NewDay said that given the number of complaints that it deals
with, if the query status was causing problems with credit files, it would expect to see a lot of
complaints about this. And it doesnt. It wanted an ombudsman to consider this complaint.
Because NewDay didnt agree with our investigator, this case was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to ask 
NewDay to do more than it had already offered to do. This is what I said then: 
Mr E first contacted NewDay to tell it about a flight ticket hed bought on the card. Mr 
E thought that the person the ticket was for, wouldnt be able to travel. So Mr E had 
asked the airline for a refund. He said it initially agreed to that. But then the airline 
said it would only refund a small amount of the payment. (I understand that this ticket 
was in fact later used.)
Mr E said he felt the agent he spoke to about the ticket was rude and unhelpful. Ive 
listened to the relevant call. I understand that Mr E felt very strongly about what the 
airline had done, but I dont agree that NewDays agent was rude or unhelpful.
NewDay has said it thinks that it shouldve offered to make a chargeback request for 
Mr E, although it thinks that a chargeback in these circumstances was unlikely to 
succeed. It has pointed out that the airline would simply be able to deny that it had 
offered Mr E any refund, and a chargeback request wouldnt be able to check the 
content of calls between Mr E and the airline. But NewDay has still offered Mr E £75 
because it didnt offer the chargeback.
I also think that a chargeback in these circumstances wouldve been very unlikely to
succeed. The circumstances that Mr E has described are ones which I would usually 
expect to be covered by travel insurance. And I understand that the person 
concerned was later able to travel, after all. So I dont think that Mr E is worse off 
because NewDay didnt offer a chargeback request.
Our service wont necessarily expect a business to offer a chargeback in 
circumstances where it was unlikely to succeed. But I note what NewDay has said, 
that Mr E had found the airline unhelpful and difficult to contact, and I agree that it 
wouldve been good customer service, in this instance, to put forward a chargeback 
request for Mr E, and get the airlines response to this.
Mr E complained about the service he received, and NewDay has noted this 
complaint on two of the three cards it held with him. Mr E says this has affected his 
credit file.
NewDay has told our service that it usually does this in order to avoid certain actions 
being taken on a card account while a complaint is ongoing. So, for example, this 
marker would stop a card debt from being sold while a complaint was live. But 
NewDay says this marker shouldnt have any negative consequences for Mr Es 
credit file. It suggests that if this dispute has affected Mr Es credit score, he could 
discuss that with the relevant agency.I can see that Mr Es credit score with one agency did drop, month on month, in the 
early part of 2020. He has shown us that this agency suggested the dispute on his 
NewDay cards might be an issue.
Lots of different things can affect a credit score. I think there are two questions I need 
to look at in this case -
Firstly, is it most likely that Mr Es score was affected by these two dispute 
markers?
Secondly, if Mr Es score was affected by these markers, did this cause a 
detriment to Mr E? In other words, was he somehow worse off because of 
this?
Ill look at each of those issues in turn.
Is it likely Mr Es credit score was affected by these markers?
I can see that Mr Es credit score was going down each month at the start of 2020, 
and that the credit reference agency he uses suggested that the disputes might be 
affecting his file. 
That agency appears to make the same suggestion to clients about disputes markers 
as it does for missed or late payments.
When Mr E brought his complaint to our service, we asked NewDay to take this 
marker off. It did that in May. Mr Es credit score started to rise again in May. If Mr Es 
credit score was affected by dispute markers, then I wouldnt have expected it to start 
to rise again so quickly.
Thats because updates to credit files usually take more than just a few days to take 
effect. And Mr E told us that these markers were still on his credit file in August. I 
would have expected them to be removed by then. But if the markers were still on his 
credit file in August, then its not clear why his credit score started to rise in May.
I think its worth noting at this point that Mr E has an unusually large amount of 
unused credit. The screenshots he sent us showed that he was using about 1% of 
the overall credit available to him, which stood at over a quarter of a million pounds. 
Because Mr Es credit file is so different to most, its particularly difficult to conclude 
what may have affected his score. 
It's difficult to see if NewDays actions did affect Mr Es file, or not. On balance, 
because Mr Es credit score doesnt seem only to have changed at the same time as 
these markers went on or came off, I think its a little more likely that these markers 
werent the reason Mr Es score was changing.
But whether or not NewDay caused these changes might not be a key issue, if the 
changes to Mr Es credit file didnt actually affect him. So Ill look at the remaining 
question.
If Mr Es score was affected, did this cause a detriment to Mr E?
Mr E hasnt told us that he applied for any additional credit or loans during this time. I 
cant assume that any such applications would not have been successful.As Ive set out above, Mr E has a very significant amount of unused credit available 
to him. So even if Mr E was put off from applying for further loans or credit in this 
time, I cant say that Mr E is likely to have been disadvantaged by that.
I dont think that Mr E has been adversely affected by changes to his credit score.
provisional conclusion
I can see that Mr E was very concerned about the changes to his credit score. But 
even if what NewDay did had affected his score, I cant say that Mr E was worse off 
because of this. So I dont think that NewDay has to pay Mr E the £1,000 in 
compensation that he asked for. 
But it is clear that NewDay did put markers on Mr Es account. It has certainly done
something which caused Mr E concern. And we now know that it didnt need to do 
this. NewDay has told us it didnt need these markers in Mr Es case, and when we 
asked it to remove them, NewDay took them straight off.
NewDay has already offered Mr E £75 to make up for what it thinks was poor service 
on a phone call he had with it. I can see that service could have been better on this 
call. And I also think that when NewDay made this offer, it could also have offered to 
remove the markers on Mr Es account. I think that wouldve been better service too.
Ive thought carefully about this case, and I do think that a payment of £75 would 
provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint, as an apology for areas 
where NewDays service could have been better.
I understand that NewDay hasnt yet paid this money to Mr E, so Ill ask it to do so 
now.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay said it would arrange a payment of the amount Id suggested. Mr E sent a 
substantive reply.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E said this wasnt a dispute about a chargeback, he was asking for advice. He said a 
marker for a missed or late payment should never have been put on his accounts. 
NewDay has told us that no late payments have been recorded on Mr Es three NewDay 
cards. Ive checked all three of Mr Es NewDay cards, and I havent seen anything to 
suggest that a marker for a missed or late payment was put on Mr Es credit file by NewDay. 
This complaint is about dispute markers.
Mr E said he never had a recording of the call that I had listened to, and NewDay had also 
told our investigator that there was not a recording available. 
NewDay sent this call recording to Mr E. Mr E told us he received this, but that he objected 
to the format in which it was sent, and NewDay said it couldnt change this for security 
reasons. I cant see that NewDay has ever suggested to our service that the recording wasnt 
available, or that it has refused Mr Es request to send the recording to him.
Mr E said he sent evidence of his credit file and Id noted that the credit reference agencies 
stated that NewDays action had had an adverse effect on his score. So Mr E said that when 
I said it had not, that was a contradiction. 
I looked closely at the changes in Mr Es credit score, and said that it was hard to relate 
these to what NewDay did, because the changes didnt happen at the same time. On 
balance, I thought it was less likely that this is what had caused the changes in Mr Es credit 
score that he complained about. 
I did take into account that Mr E had sent us a note from his credit file that says he has either 
arrears or payment queries which are impacting his credit score. I think it is surprising for a 
credit reference agency to suggest that disputes markers would have the same impact as 
arrears. I dont think I can assume that any potential lender wouldve assessed Mr Es credit 
file in the same way. 
Mr E said that moving the complaint from one card to the other cards was very clearly 
wrong, he thought it was also unlawful. He said even after NewDay said it had removed the 
markers, they were still on the account. 
NewDay removed the dispute marker on one account, then it put the markers on two other 
accounts when Mr E renewed the dispute. Ive explained I dont think NewDay needed to do 
that. But Ive also said that I need to consider what the impact of this was.
Mr E said that it was irrelevant whether he had £250k credit available or not, or whether or 
not he had applied for other credit or not. He didnt think I should have reduced the amount 
that he would receive, when our investigator had suggested £150. He said that wasnt 
enough to deter NewDay from behaving badly, or to force it to respond more quickly to a 
complaint. He wanted £1,000. 
Our service doesnt make awards to punish businesses for things they have got wrong, or to 
force them to behave differently in future. We dont have any powers to do that. So I couldnt 
make the award that Mr E wants for the reasons hes set out, even if I agreed with his 
assessment of this complaint. 
What I have to do is look at the individual circumstances of each case, and assess the 
impact that a problem had on the complainant. So I do think its directly relevant to consider 
the impact on Mr E. And I explained in my provisional decision, I didnt think that there was 
any adverse effect on Mr E from changes to his credit score. I did think that what NewDay 
did was unnecessary in this case, and had caused concern to Mr E. And NewDay itself had 
identified that its service could have been better. I thought that £75 would provide a fair and 
reasonable outcome to this complaint. I still think that now.
Ive considered what Mr E has said carefully, but I havent changed my mind. Ill now make 
the award I originally proposed.My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must pay Mr E £75.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 March 2021.
