The complaint
R, a limited company complains that WorldPay Limited is responsible for some fraudulent 
transactions as they were not submitted using 3D verification.
R wants WorldPay to refund the transactions and implement the relevant security regulation 
to prevent the same thing happening to other businesses. 
What happened
R supplies items through its online store and had used WorldPays merchant payment 
services since it opened an account in October 2020.
In September 2021, WorldPay was prompted to carry out a review of Rs account after a 
series of chargeback notifications. WorldPay then gave R notice of immediate termination of 
its contract. And WorldPay told R that it would retain money in its account for 120 days to 
cover any future chargebacks that may arise.
The investigator didnt recommend that Rs complaint be upheld. He didnt think that 
WorldPay had made a mistake or that it should be liable for Rs losses.
R wasnt happy with the investigators recommendation. R said WorldPay should be liable 
for the chargebacks as it hadnt complied with the regulation requiring 3D authentication.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised Rs complaint in my own words but our rules allow me to do 
this. Although I appreciate that R is concerned about the impact WorldPays actions have on 
other businesses, we deal with individual complaints about the service someone has 
received. It would be for the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority  to investigate 
WorldPays business practices and procedures more generally. 
Im grateful to R for confirming that it doesnt dispute WorldPays terms and conditions. As 
Im satisfied that WorldPay acted fairly and in line with the terms of Rs account when it took 
the decision to close the account and retain the money left in the account for 120 days, I 
dont think I need to say anything more than the investigator already explained in his view.
Instead, R is concerned that WorldPay didnt subject the fraudulent transactions to 3D 
verification in line with UK regulations. And that as a result, WorldPay should be held 
responsible for Rs losses. So, my decision focusses on this aspect of Rs complaint.
New regulations came into effect in September 2019 that required payment service 
providers (PSPs) to apply strong customer authentication (SCA). The Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) gave the PSPs until March 2020 to implement SCA for online banking. The 
FCA gave the e-commerce industry until March 2022 to implement SCA for online payments. 
WorldPay explains that its customers need to ensure that as a minimum, they have enabled 
3D Secure Version 1 on their online payment pages. 3D Secure (3DS) is the method used to 
provide SCA.
Where a customer uses their own or a third party payment platform instead of a WorldPay 
hosted payment page, the customer needs to make sure the payment platform asked for a 
minimum of 3DS to be completed when payment details are submitted. WorldPay itself has 
no control over the other payment platforms and cant make the changes itself. WorldPay 
says this applies to customers whove integrated any kind of XML installation. 
As R uses an Invisible XML installation, WorldPay doesnt have any control over what details 
Rs payment platform requests when payment details are submitted. WorldPay just facilitates 
the communication between the payment platform and the card issuer.
WorldPay says it needs to facilitate 3DS requests to the card issuer if the customers 
payment platform makes them. So, it has enabled 3DS on Rs platform since it was created. 
However, WorldPay cant force R to use the authentication on their platform, so if Rs 
payment platform doesnt request 3DS to be completed, WorldPay cant be held responsible 
for this.
WorldPay says the fact that 3DS had not been completed, wouldve been made available to 
R through its business manager log in  giving R the option not to go ahead with supplying 
goods to the customer. WorldPay has given this service evidence of one of the chargeback 
transactions where the payment details have a question mark rather than a tick, under the 
heading 3D Secure Matched.
As the investigator has said, its for the merchant  in this case R  to make sure 3DS is 
completed. Im satisfied that WorldPay gave R the option of requesting and completing 3DS 
since its account was opened in 2020. This means I cant find that WorldPay is responsible 
for the fraudulent transactions and subsequent chargebacks. I appreciate this is likely to 
disappoint R.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2022.
