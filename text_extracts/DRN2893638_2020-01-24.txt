Mrs W says she felt trapped  at the time into further borrowing with no option but to take out 
these expensive loans.  She doesnt think that Mr Lender checked  thoroughly to see if the 
loans were affordable  for her. She told us that she paid back  the first five loans with difficulty. 
The last loan was paid late  and only after she entered a debt management plan. 
Mr Lender says that before the loans  were provided it carried out thorough affordability and 
credit checks. Mr Lender says that based  on the information it gathered,  the lending  was 
affordable for Mrs W.
When Mrs Ws financial circumstances  changed  after shed taken out loan 6, Mr Lender  
supported her by agreeing an affordable repayment  plan. This worked for a while   then 
Mrs W entered a debt management  plan to help her manage all her payments. She was 
finally able to repay loan 6 in March 2018  almost 4 years after shed taken  out the loan. 
In its final response letter  Mr Lender  also offered to refund the interest Mrs W had paid on 
loan 6. But Mrs W didnt feel this went far enough  to put things right for her  and our 
adjudicator agreed. 
Our adjudicator thought that there  wasnt enough to say that loans  1 to 4 shouldnt have 
been provided. But he felt that by loan 5, Mrs Ws borrowing pattern should have alerted 
Mr Lender to the fact that she was having problems managing her money and it shouldnt 
have given her any further loans. He thought  that by the time of loan 5, there was a 
significant risk Mrs W wouldve been  unable to sustainably meet  the repayments for this loan 
 and any subsequent loans.
 
Mr Lender didnt accept  our adjudicators view and said it lacked detail and reasoning.  It said 
what our adjudicator said about loan 5 was factually incorrect  and untrue as Mrs W made all 
the repayments on time as per the agreement.  Mr Lender asked for a review so this 
complaint comes to me to make  a final decision.  
Ref: DRN28936382my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mrs W could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts  and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr Lender was required to establish whether Mrs W could sustainably  repay  her loans  - not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that it wasnt wrong  for Mr Lender to give Mrs W loans 1 to 4 on 
the basis of the information it had recorded about her, including  her income and outgoings. It 
was early in the lending  relationship and so I think the checks were enough for Mr Lender to 
agree to lend.  
Ref: DRN28936383As Mrs W hasnt raised any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to 
loans 1 - 4, I dont think that I need to say more about them.
Looking at Mrs Ws borrowing pattern I can see that she asked to take out loan 5 the next 
day after she repaid  loan 4  and she borrowed the same amount again. 
And this followed a track record that Mr Lender could see of borrowing quickly after repaying 
previous loans  Mrs W took out loan 2 within eleven days of paying loan 1, and loan 3 just 
two days after paying loan 2. Loan 4 started  just a few days  after she had paid loan 3. 
Mrs Ws first couple of loans had been  for £500  by now shed twice  paid back £700 loans  
and she was asking  to borrow £700 for a third time by loan 5..
This would suggest  that she was having problems managing her money and couldnt afford 
to pay back what she had borrowed  without  borrowing again.  
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for Mr Lender  to think that it was likely Mrs W would be 
able sustainably to repay loan 5, or any further loans and it shouldnt have provided this 
loan, or any further  loans  to her. 
So Im upholding  Mrs Ws complaint about loans 5 to 6.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs W towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 5 and 6, including payments made  to a third party where applicable,  but 
not including  anything already refunded.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mrs W which  were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs W originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) Pay Mrs W the total of A plus B.
D) Remove any adverse  information  Mr Lender put on Mrs Ws credit file in relation to loans 
5 and 6. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to deduct tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
should give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax it deducted if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Ws complaint  about loans 5 and 6 and PDL Finance Limited (trading  as 
Mr Lender) should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
