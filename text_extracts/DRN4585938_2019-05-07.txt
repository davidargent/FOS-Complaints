complaint  
Mr T complains that Uncle Buck Finance LLP (Uncle Buck) lent to him when he was not able 
to afford it. He says that if Uncle Buck had reviewed his lending history it would not have lent 
and its  constant stream of lending escalated his difficulty.  
background 
I attach my provisional decision dated 17 April 2019, which forms part of this final decision 
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why  
I intended to uphold Mr Ts complaint in part. I invited both parties to provide any further 
comments they may have by 1 May 2019 before I reached a further decision.  
Mr T has received my provisional decision and has emailed to tell us that he has nothing 
further to add. I have not heard from Uncle Buck.  
my findings  
I hav e reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice at the time the loans were off ered.  
I am satisfied that Mr T received my provisional decision. And as Uncle Buck has not 
provided any further arguments, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in my 
provisional decision on 17 April 2019.  
putting things right  what Uncle Buck is to do 
Uncle Buck should put things right by doing what I have set out here:  
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on Loans 3 to 9 and Loans 11 and  12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of  settlement*;
remove any negative payment information about Loans 3 to 6 and Loans 11 and 12
from Mr Ts credit  file;
the number of loans taken in the first lending chain means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So  all entries about Loans 7 to 9 should be removed from
Mr Ts credit  file
Uncle Buck can set off any monies arising from the redress against any monies Mr T may 
owe it, but to be clear this should only be in respect of the principal sum borrowed. Any 
unpa id charges and interest would need to be removed first and any payments made to the 
outstanding loan treated as if Mr T had paid down the principal.  
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. It must give
Mr T a certifi cate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Uncle Buck
intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it must do so after
deducting the tax.

The highlighted loans are not in dispute.  
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and thought that Uncle Buck should put things right 
for Mr T in relation to Loans 7, 8 and 9. This was on the basis that Uncle Buck had lent to Mr T so 
often that i t was unsustainable and as well as calculating redress our adjudicator thought that Uncle 
Buck should remove the credit file entries for Loan 7 to 9.  
There was an outstanding balance on Loan 12 and our adjudicator did think it was appropriate for 
Uncle Buck to offset the money it owed Mr T from the money he owed Uncle Buck. That would have 
left a small outstanding balance for Mr T to repay on Loan 12.  
Uncle Buck agreed with our adjudicators view and so its concession for Loans 7 to 9 means that I do 
not consider these to be in dispute any more. The agreement and therefore the offer to pay Mr T the 
redress in line with that opinion was sent to Mr T.  
Mr T did not agree with our adjudicators opinion and so did not accept the monies offered by Uncle 
Buck. Mr T asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint. He says that his low credit score and 
the defaults registered should have been a cause for concern before Loan 7. And the fact he took 
Loan 12 on the day he repaid Loan 11 should have acted as an alert to Uncle Buck.  Ref: DRN4585938  
4 The complaint remains unresolved (apart from Loans 7 to 9) and so has been passed to me for a 
decision.  
my provis ional findings  
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules 
and good industry practice at the time  the loans were offered.  
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether 
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The key element was 
that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things, 
including how much was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid.  
Uncle Buck says it checked by searching with a credit bureau and did affordability checks. The first 
check included verifying personal and financial details and bank account information. After that the 
searches it carried out used a level of search which i t says gave very up -to-date results. It describes 
this as  a real time, industry specific, data sharing service.  
Uncle Buck also explained that it was aware of the customer base it had and so a  customer having a 
default on their credit file, or other ac counts opened within six months, would not result in the 
application being declined. We look at all the information as a whole when assessing whether we 
would lend to an applicant.  
It also explained that another search it carried out  independently verif ied information about [Mr] 
Ts monthly income and expenditure. It has told us that it was satisfied that Mr Ts declared salary 
income of about £1,800 net a month was accurate based on these searches. Its searches came 
back with this being £1,820.  
And based on what it saw from these checks Uncle Buck says it decided to lend to Mr T.  
Uncle Buck has sent to us two credit bureau search results for each of the Loans 3, 5, 7 to 9 and 10 
to 12. For Loan 6 it has sent us one search  the shorter one only. It has explained that the formats of 
the searches are such that they are not used usually for manual interpretation. It has summarised 
what it describes as the key findings for some of the loans and these are very brief and restricted to 
a narrow band of  criteria. I agree  the search result documents are very difficult to read as pdf 
documents. But I have used them and successfully gathered information about Mr T which I refer to in 
my decision.  
Uncle Buck has sent account notes as well to which I ref er when relevant in the decision. These show 
when Uncle Buck and Mr T were in contact with each other by email or by telephone. I have not 
received copies of any email correspondence between the parties.  
Mr T has provided for us his personal credit file w hich shows many details for 6 years going back to 
July 2012.  
Mr T has explained that he was in a debt management plan from late 2013. He had accounts with 
Bank B which I can see were in default. Bank B registered three defaults against his name in late 
2013 and early 2014 and the three amounts came to about £12,100. And he has explained that as the 
Bank B accounts became part of the debt management plan then those accounts have had to close 
and he cannot get access to them. But these pre -date most of these  loans with Uncle Buck and so 
are not likely to be  relevant.  Ref: DRN4585938  
5  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr Ts credit file reveals that his account with Bank C commenced late 2013. I can see that in his 
applications for the loans from Uncle Buck he gave the Bank C account details. We have asked for 
these statements but Mr T has explained that asking for thes e will have a poor effect on his wellbeing 
because of the telephone calls and correspondence it will generate. So we do not have copies. I 
understand this entirely but it does limit the picture I have received of Mr Ts financial situation for 
each loan.  
 
I can see from his personal credit file that Mr T had a short term loan account with a different lender 
(Lender L) which became part of the debt management plan in late 2013 and it took him five years to 
repay it. And Mr T was in arrears with another short  term loan provider (Lender E) for all of 2014 and 
in January 2014 a third short term payday and instalment loan provider (Lender CN) had registered a 
default against his name for over £1,000.  
 
Mr T had a mortgage account and from late 2013 through all of 2014 and large parts of 2015 it was in 
arrears.  
 
So it is against this background that I review the loans offered to Mr T. And although the credit 
searches Uncle Buck has sent to us are difficult to read I do think that most if not all of the items I 
have discovered from his personal credit file are highly likely to have registered on the business 
searches carried out.  
 
The fact that these comprehensive searches are relied on heavily by Uncle Buck to demonstrate 
proportionate, thorough and up to date checks  for each loan leads me to think that its highly likely 
Uncle Buck knew of Mr Ts situation when he applied for the loans  certainly from Loan 3. I explain 
below. I have not received any credit searches for the dates around Loan 1 or Loan 2 and some of t he 
other loans as I have listed above.  
 
Loan 1 
 
This was a £100 payday loan and the repayment amount was about £135 repayable later in 
December 2014. Mr Ts declared income was £1,800 plus other income of £100 and it was Mr Ts first 
loan application to Un cle Buck. So I consider that it need not have done more for this loan as I think 
that it was proportionate for Uncle Buck to have asked for and got this information. I do not plan to 
uphold the complaint in relation to Loan 1.  
 
Loan 2 
 
Loan 2 was for three times the amount of Loan 1 (£300) but was due to be repaid over three months 
at about £137 each month. So I would have expected Uncle Buck to have known Mr Ts income at 
least in order to be a proportionate check. I say this because th e repayments were relatively low 
compared to his declared income of £1,900 which was made up of £1,800 net take home pay plus  
£100 other monthly income (unspecified). Uncle Buck had this information.  
 
Uncle Buck also had Mr Ts declared expenditure for his  monthly mortgage/rent, credit card and other 
credit repayments, utility bill commitments, transport costs and food bill for a month. All these 
amounted to £1,405 and so on the figures Mr T gave to Uncle Buck then I think its likely it would have 
calculat ed that Mr T could afford £137 a month for Loan 2.  
 
I do not plan to uphold the complaint in relation to Loan 2.  
 
Loan 3 
 
Loan 3 was for £250 and applied for a few days after repaying Loan 2 early. So I would have 
expected Uncle Buck to have known about Mr  Ts income and his expenditure to satisfy what I would 
consider to have been proportionate checks for the third loan in this lending chain. It did have that 
information and was much the same as the figures outlined above.  Ref: DRN4585938  
6  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Usually Id say that it was likely that Uncle Buck would have calculated that Mr T was able to afford 
the three £117 (rounded sum) loan instalments due for Loan 3. But my review of the credit bureau 
searches done at the time of Loan 3 show a number of things inclu ding:  
 
Code RN  sum of all active accounts regular payment field - £1,409 
Code PJC  total value of short term loans last month - £120  
Code RR  value of all current defaults - £12,043  
Code TM  total balances on active accounts excluding mortgages - £18,746 
Mortgage / fixed term total value - £97,449  
 
This was information that Uncle Buck had on file for Mr T. These figures combined with the 
information I have gained from Mr Ts personal  credit file lead me to consider that it had the 
information to place it on notice that Mr T had financial issues. And I think that more should have been 
done. I dont think that it  was. 
 
Using the information Uncle Buck had at the time, which was that Mr T had told Uncle Buck his 
income was £1,800 plus £100 (total £1,900), then deducting the RN figure above would leave a sum 
of about £491. The RN figure above would not likely have included food and travel costs. Mr T 
declared to Uncle Buck on his applicati on for Loan 3 that these costs were £250 and £100 
respectively. This would reduce the sums left over to about £141 using the information Uncle Buck 
had available to it.  
 
These Loan 3 instalments were going to be £117 so I think its likely that Uncle Buck would have 
realised that Mr T was not able to afford this loan easily or at all. And I say this because to be left with  
£24 for a month for those additional payments which inevitably crop up is too little an amount. 
I am planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint  for Loan 3.  
Loan 4 
 
Mr T applied for Loan 4 and his declared expenditure figure had increased slightly to be a combined 
declared figure of about £1,505  the food and transport figures being the same. This loan applied for 
was bigger than Loan 3 and the r epayments were due to have been £132 a month. And I think that by 
this time, the fourth loan in the lending chain, I think that some additional checks ought to have been 
carried out to see if Mr T had any outstanding short -term loans.  
 
I have not been give n any credit search results for Loan 4 and so looking at the information from the 
Loan 3 search I make the same comments as before. And I can see from the Uncle Buck account 
notes that a  Repeat Loan - Affordability Check Complete note was added on 29 May  2015. And I can 
see that Mr T had called in that day and so Uncle Bucks representatives are likely to have spoken to 
him. So they had the chance to speak to Mr T with the credit search results done for Loan 3 on file. A 
note I & E reviewed suggests tha t the representative did check this income and expenditure.  
 
I combine this information with what I have outlined as being information from Mr Ts personal credit 
file which I summarised earlier in this decision. And overall I think that if Uncle Buck had carried out 
the checks it ought to have done then it would have realised Mr T was not able to afford this loan 
easily or at all.  
 
I am planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint for Loan 4.  Ref: DRN4585938  
7  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Loan 5 
 
By this stage in the lending relationship  August 2015 - Uncle Buck would have known from its own 
records that Mr T had taken a series of instalment loans with sums which had increased from Loan 2 
and then stayed at about the £300/£275 mark for several mo nths. And then he applied for Loan 5 for  
£300 and the instalment repayments were due to have been about £152 a month which were higher 
than for the previous loans. This was in August 2015 which would have been 9 months after his first 
loan and still he was  coming back for more and on the day he repaid Loan 4.  
 
I think that proportionate checks at this stage ought to have included verifying Mr Ts income, 
expenditure plus his regular financial commitments, his short -term loan commitments and gaining a 
good o verview of Mr Ts financial position.  
 
One way to have done this was looking at his bank statements. As I have not been given them for this 
period Ive not been able to check what Uncle Buck would have seen if it had carried out these 
proportionate checks using that method. But Ive used the information available to me and from Mr T 
to piece together, so far as I am able, what that may have been like.  
 
The summary of what Uncle Buck describes as the key findings of the credit searches provided by 
Uncle Bu ck does show that it was aware Mr T had 1 default in the previous 12 months and 5 in the 
past 3 years.  
 
The credit bureau search results done for Loan 5 reveal that his monthly regular payments were  
£1,467, total balances on active accounts excluding mortgages was £17,752, value of all current 
defaults had increased since February 2015 to £14,942 and total value of all current delinquent 
accounts was £15,243.  
 
So although I may not have Mr Ts bank st atements I consider that Uncle Buck had enough 
information to realise that it was likely that Mr T was having issues financially and that it was likely he 
was not going to be able to afford this loan easily or at all. And likely he had some underlying reas on 
to continually return for these high -cost loans.  
 
I am planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint for Loan 5.  
 
Loan 6 
 
Loan 6 was for £250 and applied for in November 2015 about a week after repaying Loan 5. This was 
the sixth loan in this chain and by this po int Uncle Buck had been lending to him for almost a year, 
taking loans almost sequentially during that time. So I would have expected a full and comprehensive 
review of Mr Ts financial position to have been carried out.  
 
Uncle Buck has not given me any cr edit bureau search results nor a summary of its key findings 
either. So I do not think that one was carried out. I will look to the search done in August 2015 and 
from that I think its highly likely that the situation for Mr T was much the same in Novem ber 2015.  
 
One way to have done a comprehensive review of Mr Ts situation was by looking at his bank 
statements. As I have not been given them for this period Ive not been able to check what Uncle 
Buck would have seen if it had carried out these proporti onate checks using that method. But Ive 
used the information available to me and from Mr T to piece together, so far as I am able, what that 
may have been like. I consider that Uncle Buck had enough information to realise that it was likely 
that Mr T was having issues financially and that it was likely he was not going to be able to afford this 
loan easily or at all.  
 
I am planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint for Loan 6.  Ref: DRN4585938  
8  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Loan 7 to 9  
 
Our adjudicator upheld Loans 7 to 9 as she thought that it wouldve been clear to a responsible lender 
such as Uncle Buck that the loans werent being used for what they were intended for and were 
becoming unsustainable for Mr T to manage.  
 
Uncle Buck has agreed and so I do not plan to say more here. Ill include these loans in the putting 
things right section below for completeness.  
 
Loan 10  
 
There was a gap in the lending before Mr T applied for Loan 10 in August 2017 and so in fairness to 
the parties I  do think that the period of time was enough of a gap in the lending relationship for Uncle 
Buck to be expected to have undertaken fewer checks.  
 
For Loan 10 Uncle Buck knew Mr Ts income as £1,820 having verified it through credit checks, and 
Mr T had dec lared his income as being about £1,800. Mr T declared that his expenditure was £1,250. 
So with instalment repayments of about £110 each for three months the loan looked affordable on the 
face of it.  
 
The search Uncle Buck had carried out revealed that the value of all current defaults figure and the 
total balances on active accounts excluding mortgages figure had reduced by about £4,000 each from 
the searches done a few months earlier. And his regular monthly payments figure had come down to 
about £1,325. T he value of the defaults was still high but was historic  over three years old. So on 
the information Uncle Buck had and after a significant gap in the lending relationship then I think it 
reasonable that Loan 10 was  approved.  
 
I do not plan to uphold the  complaint for Loan 10.  
 
Loan 11  
 
This loan was for £500 - double the amount of Loan 10. Mr T applied for it a few days after repaying 
Loan 10. The instalment sums were higher at about £231 for two months and £225 was the last 
repayment due on 17 November 2017. Id expect Uncle Buck to know of Mr Ts income and his 
expenditure. But Uncle Buck had carried out a credit search and I have the results for those. I refer to 
those below.  
 
Mr T had told Uncle Buck that his income was £1,820 and his outgoings were £ 1,250.  
 
The Uncle Buck Credit search showed that the current balance on the latest STL account was £414 
which may have been Loan 10 but as it had been repaid a week earlier and as Uncle Buck has said to 
us that it subscribed to the credit bureau search result serv ice which gave it up -to-date information 
then I think it was a point worth checking. And the credit search result I have seen done at this time 
does reveal that Mr T had a history of having had a lot of other short term -loans  34 at least and their 
total value was recorded as being about £11,000. So I think that having got this information I do not 
think it was able to be ignored.  
 
So I looked at Mr Ts personal credit file and I have been able to discover that he had started to use 
other payday lenders. I  know from records that Mr T had an outstanding instalment loan with another 
short -term lender and that was costing him about £141 a month. And in late August 2017 he had just 
taken an instalment loan with a different short -term loan provider (£385 repayab le over 6 months and 
his credit file reveals it was £114 a month).  
 
I also am aware from Mr Ts personal credit file that around 26 September 2017 Mr T took a longer 
term loan for around £3,000 repayable at £150 month commencing in October 2017. This was t aken 
out after getting the Uncle Buck Loan 10 and a significant increase in long term borrowing.  Ref: DRN4585938  
9  
  
 
 
 
 
 
All of these figures lead me to think that Mr T would likely have had about £165 a month left over. And 
I think that Uncle Buck had acc ess to enough information to know about these points or be on notice 
about them such that specific enquiries with Mr T would have revealed these details.  
 
On the evidence I have at the moment I think that Uncle Buck likely assessed Mr T as being able to 
afford these wrongly as I think that the Loan 11 was unaffordable.  
 
I am planning to uphold the complaint in relation to Loan 11.  
 
Loan 12  
 
Mr T applied for Loan 12 for £450 on the same day that he was due to repay Loan 11. This was the 
third loan since August 2017 and the amounts had been increasing. Loans which are essentially 
back -to-back can be an indication that the applicant was strugg ling with finances.  
 
Mr T told Uncle Buck much the same information about his income and expenditure as he did for 
Loan 11, and I think that it ought to have known Mr Ts outstanding short term lending commitments.  
 
I know from records that Mr T had an out standing instalment loan with another short -term lender and 
that was costing him about £141 a month as mentioned earlier but Mr T had taken another with that 
same lender on 3 September 2017 (£675 for a year at about £65 a month). And Mr T was still 
repayin g the other one with that lender and repaying the Uncle Buck Loan 11. And in October 2017 
Mr T had taken a loan for £395 repayable as a payday loan on 18 December 2017 (£607 repayment 
amount). This is revealed on the credit searches sent from Uncle Buck un der code UMC. And the  
£3,000 loan commitment taken in September 2017 continued.  
 
So I think that the combination of Mr Ts declared income, expenditure and the search results plus the 
other STL Mr T owed would lead a responsible lender to think that it was  not right to lend to Mr T.  
 
I am planning to uphold Mr Ts complaint for Loan 12.
