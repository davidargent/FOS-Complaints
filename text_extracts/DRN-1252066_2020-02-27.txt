The complaint
Miss V says Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
What happened
Miss V bought the policy in 2003 at the same time as taking out a credit card via a postal 
application. 
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the complaint. Miss V disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Miss Vs case.
Ive decided not to uphold Miss V's complaint for the following reasons. 
Miss V ticked a box on her application form to indicate she wanted PPI. So, I think Capital 
One made her aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and that she chose to take 
it.
Capital One didnt recommend the PPI to Miss V so it didn't have to check if it was right for 
her.
Its possible the information Capital One gave Miss V about the PPI wasn't as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Miss V doesn't appear to have been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didn't cover  and based on what I know about her circumstances it looks like the 
policy couldve been useful to her. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped 
her buying it. 
Ive taken into account Miss Vs comments, including what she's said about being wary of 
PPI because of a previous experience. But these points dont change my conclusion. She 
clearly indicated she wanted PPI in this instance, by ticking the form on the application form.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I don't uphold Miss V's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss V to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 March 2020.
