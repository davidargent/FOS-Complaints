*At times,  Mr S had more than one loan outstanding at the same time  this is the highest total 
amount due in any one month
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint  and thought  the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed, so the complaint was passed to me.
Sunny has now made an offer in line with our recommendations for loans eleven to fifteen.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN03190652But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that loans six onwards shouldnt  have  been  provided to Mr S as the 
pattern of his borrowing  meant that Sunny shouldve been alerted to the possibility he was 
having problems  managing his money. 
Sunny said that settling  loans early didnt show that Mr S was having problems managing his 
money. It also said that the amounts  Mr S borrowed fluctuated and this shows he only 
borrowed what he needed. 
But I disagree. Rapidly  repaying an instalment loan, and then quickly applying for another 
could indicate  that there  were underlying issues with the way Mr S was managing  his 
money, and Mr S did this several times. And while the amounts Mr S borrowed did fluctuate, 
his overall indebtedness mostly increased, as some of his loans overlapped. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN03190653Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
six. 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out six loans within four months   at times overlapping 
with existing loans,  and sometimes within days of paying off previous loans. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr S was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £150  and loan, and loan six was for the same  amount   and 
also overlapped with loan five, taking his overall indebtedness to its highest level to 
date. At this point  Sunny ought  to have known that Mr S was not likely  borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in his income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  loan six onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within days  of settling. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan fifteen was 
taken out a year after Mr Ss first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr S had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Mr S borrowed was likely  to have  had negative  implications on 
Mr Ss ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Pay Mr S the offer it has already made  for loans eleven to fifteen;
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid loans six to eleven;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan six onwards  should be removed 
from Mr Ss credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN03190654my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2020.
