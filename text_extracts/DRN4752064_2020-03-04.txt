K820x#14complaint
The Royal Bank of Scotland  Plc (RBS) has offered to refund some of the interest and fees it 
charged to Miss Ws loan because it didnt  meet  its requirement under the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 (CCA). However,  it has used  the refund to reduce a debt from which 
Miss W was discharged when her protected trust deed  came to an end. Miss W doesnt think 
this is fair.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 17 February  2020. A copy of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint and explains why I dont 
think RBS needs  to pay Miss W any money.
Miss W and RBS have both confirmed that theyve received my provisional decision and say 
they have nothing to add.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I havent  received any comments or evidence in reply to my provisional decision,  I 
confirm the findings I made therein. My reasons remain the same.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, I dont think 
The Royal Bank of Scotland  Plc needs to pay Miss W any money. It doesnt need to do 
anything.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 April 2020.

complaint
The Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc (RBS)  has offered to refund some of the interest and fees it charged 
to Miss Ws loan because it didnt meet its requirement under the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 (CCA). 
However, it has used the refund to reduce  a debt from which Miss W was discharged  when her 
protected trust deed came to an end. Miss W doesnt think this is fair.
background
In 2007, Miss W borrowed £32,151, including  £7,151 to pay for a payment protection insurance  (PPI)  
policy. The loan term was supposed to be 84 months.
In 2011, Miss W granted a trust deed  which  became  a protected trust deed  for her creditors.  A 
protected trust deed is an alternative to bankruptcy (which is called  sequestration in Scotland).  It is a 
legally binding  agreement between a consumer  and her creditors,  which is administered by a trustee. 
The consumer transfers her property to the trustee,  who has the power to collect and realise assets, 
and distribute the estate among the creditors according to their respective rights and preferences. 
(Payments to creditors are usually called  dividends.)  A trust deed will invariably include provisions 
relating to the discharge of the consumer  from her debts, the restoration to her of any surplus,  and the 
discharge of the trustee.
Miss W was discharged from her debts on 11 August 2016  and her trustee  was discharged on 
29 December 2016.
In September 2018, RBS wrote to Miss W to say it had reviewed its past compliance with the CCA. 
Specifically, it said it had checked to see whether it had sent her a compliant Notice of Sums  in 
Arrears (NOSIA)  when  she missed some loan payments  in 2008. It hadnt  so it wasnt entitled to 
charge her any interest or fees between 17 November 2008  and 10 May 2017 (the period  of 
non-compliance).  It offered to refund the interest and fees charged to the loan during this period  
(£6,629.49) and used it to reduce monies owed  and left unpaid when  the trust deed came to an end. 
Miss W doesnt think this is fair.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. When considering  what is, in my opinion,  fair and reasonable  in all 
the circumstances of the case, Im required by DISP 3.6.4  R of the Financial  Conduct Authority  (FCA) 
Handbook to take into account:
(1)relevant:
(a)law and regulations;
(b)regulators  rules, guidance and standards;
(c)codes  of practice; and
(2)(where appropriate)  what  [the ombudsman] considers to have been good industry  practice at 
the relevant  time.
When the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, Ive made  my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  that is, what I think is most likely  to have happened given the available 
evidence and the wider circumstances.
Regrettably, the information provided by RBS about Miss Ws accounts since 2011 is incomplete and, 
in places, inconsistent. However, Ive summarised  the available information  below.
Ref: DRN47520643RBS has provided  a list of the last 15 transactions for Miss Ws loan account. When she 
granted her trust deed, she owed  £32,419.04.  
It looks like Miss W received some  compensation in 2013 for some mis-sold PPI policies, 
which reduced the amount she owed by £20,256.36 to £12,162.68.  
In November 2016,  theres a payment of £1,254.87, which reduced the amount Miss W owed 
to £10,907.81.
RBS has sent us its internal records for Miss W, which show the actions taken by its staff after 
Miss W granted  her trust deed. An entry from January 2017 says RBS received a final 
dividend of £1,284.90. 
However, as it was supposed to be £0.0387 for every £1 owed, someone at RBS realised  
Miss Ws trustee  had calculated  its dividend  on its original claim, which was, according  to a 
note added in September 2011, £33,194.93. After it used  Miss Ws PPI compensation  to 
reduce the amount  she owed, it submitted  (or should have submitted) a revised  claim for 
£12,162.68 and was therefore due £470.69 instead. 
In May 2017, RBS repaid the difference (£814.21) to Miss Ws trustee.
I understand Miss W had another debt with RBS, which may explain the discrepancy between 
her loan balance (£32,419.04) and the claim submitted (£33,194.93) and the discrepancy 
between the November payment (£1,254.87) and the dividend (£1,284.90).  The ratio is the 
same. On balance, I think the November  2016 payment was a dividend  payment.
However, Miss Ws loan balance wasnt subsequently amended  to reflect the refund to the 
trustee. After the revised dividend  payment of £470.69, Miss W owed £11,691.99 not 
£10,907.81.
The final transaction  on the list of transactions Ive seen is described as a loan rebate, and it 
reduced the amount  Miss W owed  by £4,690.34.  The amount owed and left unpaid when the 
trust deed came to an end was therefore £7,001.65.
Miss W has stressed that shes been discharged from all her debts  and obligations  so RBS should 
pay her the refund.
RBS says it still has a right of set-off,  which means it can use her refund to reduce any monies owed 
and left unpaid when her trust deed  came to an end, even if shes been discharged from her debts.
I dont think the language of set-off is particularly  helpful in this case. Nor do I think its necessary, in 
this case,  to consider the effect of a trust deeds termination on the final distribution of an estate.  
Ill explain why.
RBS accepts that it should not have charged Miss W any interest or fees between  17 November 2008 
and 10 May 2017. By doing so, it increased the amount  she owed by £6,629.49. In other words,  if it 
hadnt charged Miss W any interest or fees during  this period, shed have  owed £6,629.49 less than 
she did when she granted her trust deed. 
As Ive explained above, when her trust deed came to an end, Miss W owed £7,001.65. It follows  that 
if RBS hadnt charged any interest or fees to the loan during this period, shed have still owed 
£372.16. Essentially, RBS increased a debt Miss W didnt  fully repay.
As Miss W didnt pay any extra because of the interest and fees, I dont think  RBS needs to pay her 
any money.
What it must do, and what its done, is adjust the discharged  debt so that it accurately  reflects  the 
amount Miss W would have owed if it hadnt charged any interest  or fees during the period of non-
compliance. As its adjusting a debt rather  than refunding  money Miss W paid, I dont think  it makes a 
difference whether  Miss W has been discharged from the debt or not.
Finally, I accept that RBS received a larger dividend  than it would  have done if it hadnt charged 
Miss W any interest or fees during the period of non-compliance. After all, the dividend is a 
Ref: DRN47520644percentage of the amount claimed. However, it is Miss Ws other creditors who have lost out, not 
Miss W. Miss Ws trustee was appointed to look after the interests of her creditors  and hes 
confirmed that he has no interest in this complaint. So I dont think I need to consider this point 
further.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I dont think The Royal Bank of Scotland  Plc needs to pay 
Miss W any money.
So unless the comments and evidence  I get by 17 March 2020 change my mind, I wont tell it to do 
anything.
