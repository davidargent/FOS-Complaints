The complaint
Mr M complains that his monthly payments to his Buy To Let (BTL) mortgage from Accord 
Mortgages Limited (Accord) didnt reduce after he made lump sum reductions to the 
balance.
What happened
Mr M had a BTL mortgage from Accord. In October 2020, the balance was £82,208 and it 
was on a fixed rate of 3.79% until 31 December 2020. Monthly repayments were £260.56. 
He wanted to bring down the balance so he could reduce the loan to value ratio (LTV) in 
order to take advantage of a fixed rate offer from Accord. On 6 October 2020 he paid in 
£321.25, and on 13 October 2020, he paid in £6,300  reducing the balance to £75,587. He 
applied for the transfer to the new product. He asked Accord when the repayments to his 
mortgage would reduce because of the lump sum reductions. The monthly repayments 
stayed the same  and were £260.56 on 1 December 2020 and 1 January 2021. They 
reduced to £131.22 on 1 February 2021. 
Mr M complained that the monthly payments shouldve been reduced much earlier than they 
did  and hed been told so by Accord. He thought that Accords communications were 
confusing when he called them, and in dealing with his complaint.
In February 2021, Accord wrote to Mr M and said no change had been made to the 
payments as hed reduced the balance of the mortgage to apply for the new fixed rate 
product. After Mr M complained, Accord explained what had happened - in their final 
response in March 2021. They said Mr M had been misinformed when he called Accord on 
14 October 2020  when he was told the payments would reduce the following month. He 
shouldve been told that payments would normally reduce on 1 December 2020. They 
apologised for that error. 
Accord said that this was because of the way their systems work. Interest is calculated daily 
and applied monthly, but repayments are adjusted subsequently. So, in Mr Ms case, that 
wouldve been after the next payment was made in November 2020. So, the new amount 
would have been due on 1 December 2020.
But, they added that because of the product transfer that Mr M had applied for - this meant 
that payments wouldnt reduce until 1 February 2021. This was how Accords processes 
worked. So, the monthly payments stayed the same until then. This meant that because 
lower amounts of interest were applied for the months of November 2020 and December 
2020  to reflect the lower balance of the mortgage - Mr M had slightly overpaid on 1 
December 2020 and 1 January 2021. The total amount of overpayment was £46.08. They 
offered to send this back to him  but that wouldve increased the amount of the mortgage by 
the same amount.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator considered that Accord had explained 
things clearly in their final response. But the first letter in February 2021 hadnt helped and it 
wouldve been better if Accord had explained to Mr M what to expect at that time. And so  
she said they should pay compensation of £100 to Mr M.
Mr M disagreed and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. He said Accords call 
handlers had told him the payments would reduce following the reduction in the balance, but 
they didnt. He referred to two calls - on 13 October 2020, when he said he was told that 
payments would reduce in December to £238.73. And on 14 October 2020, he said he was 
told they would reduce from December 2020. He confirmed that the product transfer was not 
part of his complaint. He said that compensation of £200 was more reasonable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at what happened here  and Accords final response in March 2021 sets this out 
accurately. Its important to say that the way that Accords processes work is that  interest 
is calculated daily and applied monthly  but payments are changed in arrears. So  that 
means that in Mr Ms case, we would expect to see interest reducing because of the lump 
sum payments, but the monthly payment wouldnt be changed until the month after. This 
service doesnt provide an audit function to check mortgage accounts, but I think its helpful if 
I set out what I can see. 
Mr M was sent statements for his mortgage on 1 January 2021 (for 2020) and on 10 March 
2021 (for the period from January 2021 to March 2021). Interest on Mr Ms previous balance 
(at the fixed rate of 3.79%) was around £260.56 a month. After he paid in the two amounts 
totalling £6,621.25, the balance reduced from £82,208 to £75,587. On 1 December 2020, the 
interest reduced to £235.40. And on 1 January 2021, the interest reduced to £239.64. So  
that looks right in the light of the lower balance. 
But  the repayments remained at £260.56 on 1 December 2020 and on 1 January 2021  
because they werent changed. So, for those months, Mr M paid more in repayments than 
he needed to  as Accord said in their final response. But I want Mr M to see that the cost of 
his mortgage  the interest charged  did come down because of his reducing the balance. 
Accords processes were that in Mr Ms case, the payments shouldve been reduced on 1 
December 2020. But they werent, because when he made the lump sum payments in 
October 2020  he also applied to transfer to a new fixed rate product. This was effective 
from 1 January 2021  with the new payments starting on 1 February 2021. Accord told us 
that because of that, their systems meant that the payment on 1 December 2020 wasnt 
adjusted  and everything was changed with effect from 1 February 2021.
So  Accord followed their processes, and I can see that Mr M did benefit from being 
charged less interest after the reductions to his mortgage.
Therefore, the crux of this complaint comes down to what Mr M was told by Accord. Ive 
listened to the calls between Mr M and Accord.
On 13 October 2020, Mr M arranged to pay in £6,300 and this was done. He was then told 
by the call handler in November (2020) you pay £260.56. That was correct. But he then 
said, in December (2020), the payment drops to £238.73. That wasnt correct.
On 14 October 2020, there was another call. On that, the call handler couldnt tell Mr M what 
the new payments would be  he said this was because of the pending product transfer. But 
he also said, the payments will be updated so you will pay less for the remaining months to 
the end of December (2020). So  this was misleading to Mr M, and we wouldve expected 
the call handler to have known about the effect of the product transfer on the repayment 
schedule. Accords letter dated 4 February 2021 wasnt helpful as it didnt answer Mr Ms questions  it 
just said the overpayment would not have amended the (repayments) as the 
overpayment was specifically used to reduce the LTV only on the account. 
But on the other hand, I found Accords final response in March 2021 to be thorough and 
explained what happened well. And, Mr M was also sent the statements which covered the 
period in question  for 2020 and up to March 2021. So, he couldve seen what had 
happened.  
Mr M considers that he should receive more compensation than the £100 suggested by our 
investigator. Ive considered this. Our service has set out criteria for this purpose. We think 
awards between £100 and £300 might be suitable where there have been repeated small 
errors, or a larger single mistake, requiring a reasonable effort to sort out. I can appreciate 
that Mr M was caused some stress and anxiety by some confusing messages from Accord  
but equally, there hasnt been any financial loss. And so  I consider that the payment of 
£100 is reasonable for what happened.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Accord Mortgages Limited must:
Pay £100 compensation for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
