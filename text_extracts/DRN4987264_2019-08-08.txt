K822xcomplaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd didnt refund him £200 after a cash  machine failed to 
dispense this amount  to him. Hes also unhappy with the service provided  by NewDay.  He 
wants NewDay to pay him compensation for distress  and inconvenience  caused by its poor 
service. 
background 
In September  2017, Mr C attempted to withdraw £200 from a cash  machine. He says the 
cash machine didnt dispense the amount requested. But his account was still debited. 
The cash  machine that Mr C used wasnt owned by NewDay but by bank B. Mr C called 
bank B immediately to report the machine hadnt dispensed any money to him. Bank B 
confirmed that there was a problem with the machine and told Mr C to raise a dispute  with 
his credit provider, NewDay, so that the transaction could be reversed. 
Mr C complained to NewDay and raised  a dispute  about the £200  transaction.  Mr C told 
NewDay that bank  B had acknowledged the failed  transaction. And he asked NewDay  for a 
refund. 
NewDay looked into Mr Cs complaint and initially couldnt locate the disputed  transaction  
from looking at Mr Cs September 2017 account statement. So they declined  Mr Cs claim.  
However, in June 2018, after reviewing  Mr Cs statements  again  NewDay  was able to 
identify the disputed transaction by looking at Mr Cs October 2017 account statements. 
NewDay accepted  it made a mistake.  To put things right NewDay  refunded the £200 
transaction. It also refunded Mr C £56.95  associated  interested and £6.00 cash advance  fee. 
And offered Mr C £150 compensation  for the trouble and upset  caused.  Mr C didnt accept 
NewDays offer. He wants more compensation. He says he made  numerous  phone calls to 
NewDay and spent  several hours on hold with various departments trying to get things 
sorted out. He says this caused him a great deal of frustration and distress.  
An investigator looked into Mr Cs complaint.  He thought the offer of £150 was fair. Mr C 
disagreed. He says £150 isnt enough to reflect the amount  of stress and inconvenience hes 
suffered.  As no agreement has been reached the case has come to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come  to the same  findings and conclusions as the investigator. I know  
this will be a disappointment to Mr C. So Ill explain  why.
Everyone agrees  that NewDay made  a mistake and shouldve provided  Mr C with better  
customer service.  So Ive focussed on whether the offer made by NewDay does enough to 
put things right for Mr C.
NewDay has refunded  the £200  that was debited from Mr Cs account incorrectly.  It has also 
refunded Mr C £56.95  associated  interested  and the £6.00  cash  advance  fee. So Im 
Ref: DRN49872642satisfied Mr C hasnt lost out financially. And NewDay has put Mr C back in the position  he 
wouldve been in had the mistake not happened. 
I understand Mr C is upset that the £200 refund  is recorded on his account  statement as a 
credit gesture of goodwill. He wants the refund to appear as such on his statement to reflect 
the withdrawal was refunded. Hes told our investigator that a good will gesture is a goodwill 
gesture. It is not a refund.  
Our investigator has confirmed with NewDay that the £200 goodwill  credit paid into Mr Cs 
account on 8 June 2018 is a refund. And its provided evidence to support  this. So despite  
what Mr C says, Im satisfied that he has received a refund.  I also want  to point out that its 
up to a bank to decide its policy and procedures  that includes how it records  information on 
statements it issues to its customers.  Its not something which  this service  would normally  
interfere with. Concerns  about banks practices would be a matter for the regulator  of the 
bank  The Financial  Conduct Authority.
Mr C says £150 isnt enough for the distress, time and energy hes wasted  trying  to resolve 
things. He says when he called NewDay he was kept on hold for hours  and had to explain 
his case over and over again  which was frustrating. He also says NewDay took too long to 
sort things  out despite being  provided  with clear information by him on the day of the 
disputed transaction.  So I can understand Mr Cs frustration.  
The amount  of compensation fairly payable is a matter for my judgement and Ive taken into 
account our published guidance about  this. Mr C hasnt provided  any additional information 
to show the costs involved in making the calls,  so my investigation and award is based on 
what we are aware of, the stress and inconvenience  Mr C has told us the situation caused  
him. NewDay has apologised for falling short on the standard  of service they aimed to 
provide and have  offered to pay Mr C £150  in compensation. 
I appreciate the situation mustve been frustrating for Mr C. But I think  the offer NewDay has 
made to put things  right, as summarised  above,  is fair and reasonable given the overall 
circumstances of the case,  including the concerns Mr C has raised about the way the bank 
handled his complaint. So I dont  think it needs  to do anything  else to put things right. 
my final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must pay Mr C £150 to compensate for poor customer 
service. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 September 2019.
