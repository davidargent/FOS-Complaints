The complaint
Mr W complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn No. 1 Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr W under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
he electronically signed in August 2020. He says that there were some faults with the car so 
he told the dealer that he wanted to reject the car within 30 days of it being supplied to him 
but it didnt agree. He then complained to Moneybarn and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert in October 2020. The experts report concluded that 
there were faults with the car which required further investigation but would have been 
developing when the car was supplied to Mr W.
The dealer didnt accept the experts finding so Moneybarn arranged for the car to be 
checked by a manufacturers dealer. It found no fault with the car. Moneybarn paid Mr W 
£100 because of the time that it had taken to deal with his complaint and £39.60 to 
reimburse him for the cost of some repairs to the cars headlights  and it refunded one 
monthly payment of £265.61. Mr W wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was anything wrong with the car so he didnt think that Moneybarn had 
supplied Mr W with a car that was of unsatisfactory quality. He didnt think that it would be 
fair or reasonable to ask Moneybarn to take back the car.
 
Mr W has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in 
summary, that all the faults identified in the inspection report havent been considered, the 
independent expert wasnt asked to look at the issue with the cars headlights and the 
manufacturers dealer only investigated the ticking noise. He says that the exposed wires 
under the bonnet should have been checked but havent been considered.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr W - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr W was about five years old, had been driven for 
104,337 miles and had a price of £10,089;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr W complained to Moneybarn about four specific faults with the car: a clicking 
noise from the drivers side of the car, difficulty with the gears, a seatbelt warning 
light and a fault with the stop/start function;
Moneybarn arranged for the car to be inspected in October 2020 and the experts 
report identified a clicking when the car was slowing down which required further 
investigation and broken and frayed wires under the bonnet, and it said that a new 
battery may be required which could be affecting the cars start/stop system (but it 
said that it didnt fail at the time of inspection);
the dealer didnt accept the experts findings and Moneybarn arranged for a further 
investigation of the car by a manufacturers dealer in December 2020  it 
investigated the noise issue but no fault could be found and it conducted a health 
check on the car  but no issues were found  the cars mileage was recorded as 
107,437 at that time;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the manufacturers dealers health check 
of the car would have identified any broken and frayed wires under the bonnet of the 
car if they had been a cause of concern;
the car had passed an MOT test in August 2020  before it was supplied to Mr W  
and no advisories were noted  the MOT test includes checking that a cars 
headlights are working properly and the car wouldnt have passed an MOT test if 
there had been a fault with its headlights at that time;
the car also passed an MOT test in August 2021 when its mileage was recorded as 
112,797  so, in the year that hed had the car, Mr W had been able to use it to drive 
more than 8,000 miles;
the car had been driven for 104,337 miles when it was supplied to Mr W and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there were any faults with the 
car at that time that would have caused it not to have been of satisfactory quality for 
a car of that age and mileage;
Moneybarn has paid Mr W £100 because of the time that it took to deal with his 
complaint and £39.60 to reimburse him for the cost of some repairs to the cars 
headlights and it refunded one monthly payment of £265.61  which is more than I 
would have required it to do in these circumstances;
Mr W says that Moneybarn has recorded missed payments on his credit file  but 
that didnt form part of his original complaint to Moneybarn (or this service) so Im 
unable to consider it in this decision (if Mr W wants to complain about the information 
that Moneybarn has recorded on his credit file he should first make a complaint to it 
and then, if hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a separate 
complaint to this service); 
its clear that Mr W feels strongly that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it 
was supplied to him and that he should be able to reject it but Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality at that 
time; and
I sympathise with him for the issues that hes experienced but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Moneybarn to allow Mr W 
to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any more compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
