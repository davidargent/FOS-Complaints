The complaint
Miss C complains that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly when it increased her credit card limit 
in 2021. 
What happened
Miss C applied for a credit card with NewDay in 2020. The following year NewDay increased 
Miss Cs credit limit and in 2021 the credit card limit was increased again. In 2022, Miss C 
complained to NewDay that it had acted irresponsibly when it increased her credit card limit 
in November 2021 and explained that her income had now reduced.
NewDay told Miss C it believed it had acted responsibly but decided to uphold the complaint 
because of Miss Cs change in circumstances. NewDay refunded any late payment and over 
limit charges for period after the November limit applied, and refunded cash advance fees for 
the same period. NewDay also agreed to refund a proportionate amount of interest applied 
since the increase. Miss C felt that NewDay should also reduce her credit card balance to 
the level it was before the increase in November 2021, so she brought her complaint to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service. One of our Investigators looked into things and thought that 
the remedy offered by NewDay was a fair and reasonable one. Miss C asked that an 
Ombudsman decides the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Miss C will be disappointed, but Ive decided that the remedy NewDay offered 
is a fair and reasonable one. I will now explain why.
There isnt a specific set of checks that lenders have to complete before approving an 
application for credit. In this case, Im satisfied NewDay looked at Miss Cs credit file and 
considered what Miss C said in her application before deciding to provide her with a credit 
card. NewDay took into account the income Miss Cs said she earned at the time and 
recorded that Miss C had no adverse credit information.
The crux of Miss Cs complaint relates to the November 2021 credit limit increase. Ive seen 
that NewDay was also considering an application for another credit card within its group of 
companies. However, its important for me to clarify that whilst the second credit card 
application was approved with a relatively small credit limit, the card was cancelled quickly 
and has never been used. So, my decision has focussed on the increase in the credit limit 
for Miss Cs existing card.
Miss C believes the credit limit on her existing card shouldnt have been increased because 
she was only making minimum payments. NewDay investigated and decided that having 
reviewed the information available and the comments from Miss C, it would uphold her 
complaint about the credit limit increase in November 2021.
Because NewDay accepted it shouldnt have increased Miss Cs credit limit in 2021, I only 
have to consider whether the remedy it provided was a fair and reasonable one in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Miss C strongly believes that NewDay should also reduce 
her credit card balance to what it was before the credit limit increased in November 2021. 
However, I think this would be unfair as Miss C will have used the funds in question. But I 
would expect NewDay to refund all the interest, fees and charges added as a result of the 
funds that were irresponsibly lent and ensure that the consumer paid no more than the 
amount lent. In this case, NewDay refunded the late payment and over limit charges since 
the November 2021 increase, and refunded cash advance fees as well as refunding a 
proportionate interest amount to the account. So, in the circumstances of this case I consider 
what NewDay has already done is fair and reasonable and I wont be asking it to do anything 
else in this regard.
NewDay has confirmed it has applied the refund of interest to Miss Cs credit card account 
although it may help Miss C if NewDay confirms to her when this was paid 
My final decision
Ive decided that the offer made by NewDay Ltd to resolve Miss Cs complaint was a fair and 
reasonable one and I wont be asking it to do anything else in this regard.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
