The complaint
Mr H complains about the service he has received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal) when trying to withdraw funds from his account. 
What happened
Following an unsuccessful transaction, £5.30 was sent by a company to PayPal in order for 
this to be refunded to Mr H. As Mr H didnt have a PayPal account, he set one up and linked 
his debit card to his PayPal account. Mr H says the account set-up included a fee of £1 
being debited and then credited back into his debit card account. However, Mr H was then 
told by PayPal his debit card wasnt eligible so they couldnt refund the £5.30. PayPal then 
asked for details of Mr Hs bank account, so he complained. PayPal responded and 
explained a team member helped with Mr Hs query and they were able to provide a 
resolution.  
Our investigator looked into things for Mr H. He thought PayPal hadnt made an error in 
relation to the balance withdrawal. Mr H disagreed so the matter has come to me for a 
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr H will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
PayPal say the £5.30 cant be withdrawn as Mr Hs debit card isnt coming up as an eligible 
card. PayPal say some debit cards may not be listed on a customers account as eligible for 
instant transfer and this isnt something which can be changed or overturned by PayPal. 
From the information provided, I can see Mr H has attempted to withdraw the funds from his 
PayPal account to his debit card a number of times  but all attempts have been 
unsuccessful. PayPal say theyre unable to advise why some debit cards are eligible for 
withdrawal and others arent as this is determined by the card issuer. I can see this led to 
some confusion as this appeared to suggest it was determined by the bank which issued   
Mr Hs debit card. I think its important to clarify a card issuer is the financial business with 
which a consumer has a card account and has issued the debit card, and a card scheme is 
the business that runs the payment network and links the relevant parties in a transaction. 
I can see Mr H then approached his card issuer direct in light of PayPals comment. And, 
theyve said there are no blocks in place on Mr Hs debit card that would prevent Mr H from 
sending or receiving payments from PayPal. 
PayPal then explained Mr Hs debit card doesnt have capability to do the withdrawal and 
referred to the card scheme which applies to Mr Hs debit card. PayPal say a card scheme 
provider sends PayPal a file with all eligible cards with instant withdrawal capability, and 
based on eligibility, PayPal provide withdrawal capabilities to relevant users. PayPal say the 
debit card provider doesnt allow instant withdrawals on Mr Hs debit card so this is why he 
isnt able to withdraw the funds. Mr H has therefore approached the card scheme provider 
and theyve explained they have contracts with client banks (card issuers), and the client 
banks have contracts with merchants, processors and cardholders. They say PayPal is a 
third-party processor so their contract is with the client banks. And its the client banks who 
are responsible for all account management and billing enquiries. They signpost Mr H back 
to the client bank  and card issuer in this case. And, I can see the card issuer again confirm 
there are no blocks on Mr Hs debit card and point out that PayPal were able to debit and re-
credit £1 into Mr Hs account  which they say shows this method was authorised and 
accepted. 
I do understand Mr Hs frustration here as he wants to withdraw the £5.30 from a PayPal 
account he has had to create in order to receive a refund from a company. PayPal have 
referred to the card issuer and card scheme being responsible for Mr Hs debit card not 
being eligible. Mr H has made enquiries with both and their comments arent consistent with 
PayPals account. So, I do acknowledge why Mr H remains unconvinced with PayPals 
explanation and why he believes the issue relates to PayPals system. 
My role requires me to say how a complaint should be settled quickly and with minimal 
formality and so Ill focus on what I consider to be the crux of the complaint. Where evidence 
is inconclusive or contradictory  as some of it is in this case - Ill make my decision on the 
balance of probability, thats to say what I consider more likely to have happened. Ill also 
keep in mind what I consider to be fair and reasonable to both parties.
In this case, while I have carefully considered the comments from the card issuer and card 
scheme, Im persuaded by a screenshot of the system information provided by PayPal. This 
shows a review by PayPals technical team and an error message which was displayed 
following Mr Hs attempt to withdraw the funds to his debit card. The error message says   
Mr Hs debit card doesnt have capability for instant withdrawal. This is also supported by a 
screenshot provided by Mr H which lists his debit card and says These cant be used for 
transfers. So, while I accept there is a problem preventing Mr H from withdrawing his funds, 
its not clear who specifically is responsible for this and the underlying cause. What is clear 
though is that Mr Hs debit card isnt eligible and I havent seen any compelling evidence 
which persuades me this is an error caused by PayPals systems. As mentioned above, I 
have taken into account comments from the card issuer and card scheme. But, given 
PayPals comments that not all debit cards are eligible, the screenshot provided by PayPal 
persuades me that their system is working in the way it should. And, on this basis, I believe 
its more likely than not, the reason Mr H isnt able to withdraw the funds is down to his debit 
card not being eligible  and this is outside of PayPals control.   
I note Mr H is understandably concerned about how PayPal were successfully able to debit 
and re-credit £1 to the same debit card theyre now claiming is ineligible. PayPal say they 
were able to re-credit the £1 to Mr Hs debit card as they initially debited the same amount 
from Mr Hs debit card. They say the £5.30 was credited by another company, so the same 
process cant be applied  and this will require an eligible debit card. I understand Mr H feels 
a process of validation has occurred here to show PayPal are able to carry out a transaction 
using his debit card. 
I dont dispute a transaction has occurred here so I wish to reassure Mr H I do understand 
why he remains concerned and why hes querying why a similar process cant be followed. 
But PayPal have explained their process and while its not clear why PayPal have a process 
that allows them to validate a debit card for a £1 debit and re-credit transaction but not for 
funds credited by a separate company, this is their process. So, similar to what Ive said 
above, this is an intended feature of PayPals system and nothing Ive seen suggests this is 
an error or that the process has been applied unfairly to Mr Hs case. While I havent seen any evidence to suggest theres been an error by PayPal, I do accept, 
and its not disputed, that theres £5.30 in Mr Hs PayPal account which is owed to him. I 
think its important to make it clear at this point that our service doesnt have the power to 
direct a business to change their processes. But, we can look to see whether a business has 
applied their processes fairly  and thats what Ive done here. I can see Mr H has set out 
some options on how PayPal can transfer this to him and I can see our investigator has put 
these to PayPal but theyve explained their process allows two options in these 
circumstances. The first is for Mr H to enter his bank details to his PayPal account and 
withdraw the funds or he can provide PayPal with an email address associated with a friend 
or family members PayPal account so the funds can be transferred to them. In keeping with 
our remit as an alternative dispute resolution service to determine complaints quickly and 
with minimal formality, Ive considered whether I think PayPal have offered a fair and 
reasonable solution in the circumstances of this case  and I think they have. 
I note Mr H is concerned about providing his bank details to PayPal and I can see he has 
provided screenshots which show he removed his credit card from his PayPal account but a 
later screenshot shows the credit card still listed on Mr Hs profile information. I do 
acknowledge why this will cause Mr H to feel apprehensive about entering his bank details to 
his PayPal account, but its not clear from the screenshot whether this page lists all cards 
ever linked to the account or just the active cards. But, PayPal say Mr Hs bank account 
details will be safe and secure and Mr H is able to delete his bank account details from his 
PayPal account once the funds have been transferred to his bank account. And, he can also 
delete his PayPal account at this point  which I think is an additional step available to Mr H 
if he remains concerned about his bank details showing on the profile information section of 
an active PayPal account. In addition to this, PayPal have also offered a separate solution 
which wont involve Mr H providing his bank details. So, in the circumstances of this case, I 
think PayPal have offered fair and reasonable solutions for Mr H to claim the £5.30. 
I understand Mr H will be disappointed, and I do acknowledge why a consumer will want to 
know specifically who is at fault if theres a problem. But, despite there being conflicting 
accounts, I havent seen any evidence there has been an error by PayPal. I wish to reassure 
Mr H Ive read and considered everything he has sent in, but if I havent mentioned a 
particular point or piece of evidence, it isnt because I havent seen it or thought about it. Its 
just that I dont feel I need to reference it to explain my decision. This isnt intended as a 
discourtesy and is a reflection of the informal nature of our service. And, its also for this 
reason that Ive considered PayPals proposals as being fair and reasonable and a way 
forward for Mr H to claim the funds owed to him. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
