K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly  and 
unreasonably when dealing with their application to borrow more money under a mortgage.  
They want  the early  payment  charge  refunded
background
Mr and Mrs P had a mortgage with NatWest, which if repaid early  would  mean theyd have to 
pay an early repayment  charge (ERC). They wanted to borrow  more money to consolidate 
unsecured debts and applied  for a further advance to NatWest. Mr and Mrs P said that 
NatWest made them wait months  before  declining  the application, which  caused  them  
financial hardship. Another lender was willing to give them a mortgage,  including  the extra  
money, so Mr and Mrs P repaid the NatWest mortgage early, paying the ERC. Mr and Mrs P 
thought as another lender was willing to lend,  NatWests lending  policy was irresponsible.
Mr and Mrs P complained to NatWest.  It said it took about a week from application to decline 
the application to borrow more money.  NatWest noted that it allowed an appeal,  but the 
information within Mr and Mrs Ps credit records contained negative information about  their 
ability to repay and the explanation from Mr and Mrs P wasnt  sufficient to persuade it to 
allow the application to proceed. Mr and Mrs P continued to challenge the decision and 
NatWest said that another application was made,  though it was again unsuccessful  and 
appealed. NatWest felt it had tried to help Mr and Mrs P as much as possible as they werent 
willing to accept the initial decision.
Mr and Mrs P complained to us. The adjudicators  view was that Mr and Mrs P did appeal 
NatWests refusal to lend twice and it was their decision  to do so, rather  than go elsewhere.  
He also said that it was Mr and Mrs Ps choice  to repay the mortgage early. The adjudicator  
didnt uphold  the complaint.
Mr and Mrs P disagreed. They said that this service had taken NatWests  side.  Mr and Mrs P 
denied appealing  more  than once.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lenders are able to use their commercial judgement about to whom  to lend and how much. 
That isnt something  with which this service would  interfere,  provided that the lending  
policies are applied  fairly  and reasonably.  And lenders are able to take different  views about 
lending and risk, so the fact that one lender  will lend when another wont doesnt mean either 
is at fault. Its also worth  noting that the term irresponsible lending generally is used when 
someone thinks a loan shouldnt have been  granted, not when the application is declined.  
Its not irresponsible to refuse to lend.
In Mr and Mrs Ps case, I dont think NatWest  was unfair or unreasonable in applying  its 
lending policies. Lenders must ensure  that any loans are affordable and there  were  
reasonable grounds for NatWests concerns within the credit records.  
Ref: DRN30645622Mr and Mrs P also complain about the time taken by NatWest. But it declined both 
applications about a week after they were made;  it was the appeal  that took time. 
Mr and Mrs P chose  to appeal (and more than once); this is shown by the information and 
letters that they sent to try to persuade NatWest  to change its mind. But NatWest was clear 
that for an appeal to succeed, new evidence of Mr and Mrs Ps ability to repay would be 
required and no such evidence was received.
Mr and Mrs P want the ERC  refunded. But the ERC  was clearly  set out in the mortgage offer 
they accepted,  and it was Mr and Mrs Ps choice to repay the mortgage early, knowing of the 
ERC before they did so (as shown by the correspondence at the time and the complaint to 
this service). Mr and Mrs P couldve got a second  mortgage for example and kept the 
original mortgage,  or taken other  steps.  NatWest is entitled to the ERC  and it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable for it to be refunded.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to accept or reject my decision 
before 15 November 2019.
