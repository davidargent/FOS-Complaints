The complaint
Mr and Mrs K complain that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly reduced the borrowing 
limit on their secured facility. They ask that their credit files are corrected and for suitable 
compensation. Mr K has dealt with the complaint throughout.
 
What happened
In 2004, Mr and Mrs K took out a NatWest One account. This was a current account which 
allowed them to borrow up to a specified limit, with the borrowing secured on their house. 
NatWest said they were in arrears and exceeded their borrowing limit. It took possession of 
their house. It recorded adverse information on Mr and Mrs Ks credit files. Mr K says 
NatWest wrongly reduced their borrowing limit, making it appear theyd exceeded it.
Mr and Mrs K raised a number of complaints. Were not able, under our rules, to look into all 
of these complaints. I wrote to the parties setting out what parts of Mr and Mrs Ks 
complaints we can, and cant, look into.
I said we cant look into Mr and Mrs Ks complaint that NatWest wrongly reduced the facility 
borrowing limit, as this was brought to us outside our time limits. I said we wont re-visit any 
matters which had been decided by a court. And we cant look into Mr and Mrs Ks concerns 
about the way NatWest dealt with their complaint as complaint handling isnt a regulated 
activity.
I said we can look into Mr and Mrs Ks complaints that:
NatWest reported incorrect information to the credit reference agencies, on and after 5 
February 2013 (except in so far as this relates directly or indirectly to the borrowing limit).
NatWest sent statements with incorrect information.
NatWest said it would waive legal fees, but didnt do this.
Discrepancies in valuations of the property delayed its sale after NatWest took 
possession.
I sent a provisional decision to the parties setting out what I thought about this complaint. In 
summary, I said that I thought NatWests offer to correct Mr and Mrs Ks credit files, and pay 
£600 compensation for any upset, was fair and reasonable.
Mr and Mrs K didnt agree. Mr K sent further comments and evidence. Some of this relates 
to parts of the complaint that Ive already explained we cant look into. And some relates to 
new issues that werent part of the complaint when it was brought to us. I wont be looking 
into these issues here. 
Having read what Mr K has said, I havent changed my decision, or the reasons for my 
decision from those set out in my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Much has happened in relation to Mr and Mrs Ks account with NatWest over nearly 15 
years. Consistent with our informal approach, I wont set out everything thats happened, or 
every disputed fact, event or comment. 
Mr K said in his response to my provisional decision that he doesnt agree with the evidence 
provided by NatWest, which he says is factually incorrect. I should say here that where the 
evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of 
probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the 
available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr K also said NatWest wasnt entitled to take the steps it has. In particular, he wants 
NatWest to acknowledge it was wrong to reduce the facility limit: Ive explained I cant look 
into this part of Mr and Mrs Ks complaint. 
What happened  in brief
Mr and Mrs K opened an account with NatWest in 2004. They could borrow up to the facility 
limit, and repay and reborrow within the facility limit. The debt was secured on their property. 
The account didnt require monthly payments of a fixed amount, but Mr and Mrs K had to 
pay their net income into the account. Any borrowing had to be repaid within the 20-year 
term and before they retired.
The terms of the facility set out circumstances in which NatWest was entitled to demand 
repayment, reduce the facility or forbid further withdrawals. This included exceeding the 
facility limit without NatWests prior agreement or breaching another obligation which wasnt 
remedied within a reasonable time. Mr K asks that I note that he disputes that NatWest had 
the right to demand repayment. 
NatWest issued a demand for repayment of the total debt outstanding in 2010, saying Mr 
and Mrs K had exceeded the facility limit. The demand said NatWest could apply to court for 
possession and would register details of the amount outstanding with credit reference 
agencies. In 2012 NatWest started possession proceedings.
Court action was stayed by a court order issued in early 2013, which attached terms agreed 
by NatWest with Mr and Mrs K (known as a Tomlin order). Under the agreed terms Mr and 
Mrs K would make payments of £2,000 per month and repay the debt before the end of 
2015. It is disputed whether it was agreed that the facility limit would be reduced, after 
NatWest agreed to write off £50,000 of the outstanding debt.
Mr and Mrs K made payments which covered the agreed monthly payments up to October 
2014. After this, monthly payments werent maintained. Mr and Mrs K didnt repay the debt 
by the end of 2015. NatWest asked the court to lift the stay and make an order for 
possession.
In 2016 Mr and Mrs K applied to the court to have the Tomlin order and the attached terms 
set aside. The court dismissed Mr and Mrs Ks application and restored NatWests 
possession application. NatWest took possession of the property in 2018. It recorded a 
default on Mr and Mrs Ks credit files.
Was the information reported by NatWest on Mr and Mrs Ks credit files fair?Before the complaint came to us, NatWest agreed that some of the information it recorded 
on Mr and Mrs Ks credit file wasnt right. It offered to correct this by removing adverse data 
recorded between November 2013 and October 2014, make changes so that Mr and Mrs Ks 
credit files show missed payments from November 2014, and record a default in June 2018 
(when it took possession of the property) rather than later in 2018. It offered £600 
compensation. Mr and Mrs K say this isnt fair.
The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) issued principles for the reporting of arrears to 
credit reference agencies. This requires lenders to report data that is fair, accurate, 
consistent, complete and up to date. Lenders have to report missed payments and arrears. 
ICO says the purpose of reporting arrears is to indicate at the earliest opportunity that a 
customer is showing signs of potential financial difficulty.
The original facility, taken out in 2004, allowed Mr and Mrs K to borrow up to the facility limit, 
and repay and reborrow within the facility limit. But in 2010 NatWest issued a demand for 
immediate repayment of the total amount outstanding. I dont think its reasonable to say Mr 
and Mrs Ks right to borrow or reborrow under the facility continued after NatWest issued a 
demand for immediate repayment of the total amount outstanding.
The terms of Mr and Mrs Ks account say that NatWest will report information about their 
account to the credit reference agencies. And the demand for repayment also told them this. 
I dont think it was necessary for this to be included in the terms attached to the Tomlin 
order.
The purpose of the Tomlin order was to hold possession action while Mr and Mrs K repaid 
the debt on the agreed terms. It didnt re-instate Mr and Mrs Ks right to borrow under the 
facility, or say they could choose how much they repaid each month. Just the opposite  Mr 
and Mrs K agreed to make monthly payments of £2,000 and repay the debt in total by the 
end of 2015.
That said, I think it would be unfair for NatWest to record payments as missed or late while 
Mr and Mrs K made payments as agreed under the Tomlin order. But when they stopped 
making payments in late 2014, I think it was fair for NatWest to record this on their credit 
files.
I dont think it changes matters that Mr and Mrs K stopped making agreed payments in late 
2014 and NatWest didnt take possession until mid-2018. During this time Mr and Mrs K 
didnt make payments and its fair that their credit files reflect this.
NatWest has taken possession of Mr and Mrs Ks property and I think its fair that it records a 
default on their credit files.
I think theres an argument here that NatWest should have recorded the default earlier. 
Either in mid-2015 when Mr and Mrs K hadnt made agreed payments for six months, or in 
late 2015 when they didnt repay the debt as agreed.
However, I can see from NatWests notes that during this time Mr and Mrs K disputed what 
had been agreed in 2013 and raised complaints with NatWest about issues relating to the 
account and the security property. They applied to court for the Tomlin order to be set aside. 
I appreciate that NatWest might not have thought it fair to record a default until these matters 
were resolved.
I think its right for NatWest to record a default on Mr and Mrs Ks credit files in June 2018, 
when it took possession of the property.NatWest accepts that it did record some incorrect information on Mr and Mrs Ks credit files. 
I havent seen evidence that this prevented Mr and Mrs K accessing credit. If they did have 
difficulty getting credit, I think its more likely this was due to their financial circumstances. 
And, while I appreciate how upsetting this situation is for Mr and Mrs K, I think this is also 
largely due to their difficult circumstances, rather than an error by NatWest in recording 
information on their credit files. 
I think NatWests offer to correct Mr and Mrs Ks credit files, and pay £600 compensation for 
any upset, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
In response to my provisional decision Mr K provided copy extracts from his credit report. 
The extracts were not from recent credit reports so any issues Mr K is concerned about 
might by now have been updated. If not, Id remind both parties that my decision is that 
NatWest should correct Mr and Mrs Ks credit files as it has offered to do. 
Other complaint issues
NatWest agreed that the automated monthly statements sent to Mr and Mrs K didnt contain 
correct information. It sent manual statements with correct information, and arranged to stop 
the automated statements being sent. I think this is fair.
NatWest said it had waived legal fees, as agreed with Mr and Mrs K. It said the reason there 
was no refund shown on Mr and Mrs Ks account is because the legal fees were never 
applied to the account. I think this is a reasonable response to Mr and Mrs Ks concerns.
NatWest said it has received more than one valuation of the property. I think NatWest is 
entitled to have the property valued before marketing it for sale, and its for the valuer to 
assess the value of the property. While I can understand Mr and Mrs Ks frustration, I dont 
think its fair to say NatWest made an error if different valuers put different valuations on the 
property.
Putting things right
I think NatWests offer to make changes to Mr and Mrs Ks credit files and pay £600 
compensation is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Mr K says he intends taking this matter to court. If Mr and Mrs K dont accept my decision, 
they will be free to take this to court if they want to do so. They might consider taking legal 
advice first. Mr K also says he will raise his concerns about inaccuracies in information 
provided by NatWest with ICO (the Information Commissioners office), as of course he is 
entitled to do. 
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should make the changes to Mr and 
Mrs Ks credit files and pay £600 to them, as it offered to do, to the extent it hasnt already 
done so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K and Mr K to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 April 2021.
