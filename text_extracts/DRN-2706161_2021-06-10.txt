The complaint
Mr B and Mrs B complain that Legal & General Investment Management Limited didnt pay 
the amount it should have done when Mr B instructed it to sell an investment.
What happened
On 16 March 2020 at 11.30 Mr B called L&G and instructed it to sell units in the L&G UK 
Equity Income Fund (the fund) to the value of £2,400. At the time of his call the value of the 
investment was shown as £2,553. 
The terms of the account with L&G state that withdrawals instructions will be processed at 
the next valuation point, which was 12 midday. Mr B checked what the value of the 
investment was at the 12 midday valuation point, when he got home later on the 16 March 
2020, and this showed the same value as before he placed the trade. 
However, the total value of the investment at the valuation point was £2,223.75 and as he 
had instructed L&G to sell units to the value of £2,400 it had sold all the units.
In its response to his complaint L&G said Mr B hadnt been told he would receive £2,400 and 
he had been told the value couldnt be guaranteed. However, it said it could have been 
clearer about what would happen if the value fell below £2,400. It explained that, as the 
value of the units at the valuation point was lower than the amount he had asked for, it had 
withdrawn 100% of the investment.
L&G explained there had been a delay in the updating of price on its systems, which it said 
usually takes place at 4pm. This meant that when he had called on 17 March 2020 it had 
been unable to tell him what he was due to receive. It said it subsequently called to let him 
know he was getting back less than the £2,400.
L&G explained that the delay in receiving the prices affected its online service but that when 
Mr B checked the price it would have stated it was the previous days price. However, it said 
it recognised Mr B may not have noticed this as he wasnt expecting it. It offered trouble and 
upset of £50 for the service failures.
One of our investigators considered the complaint but didnt think it needed to do anything 
more. She said, based on the evidence she had seen, that the trade was placed at 11.36am 
on 16 March 2016 in accordance with Mr Bs instructions. She wasnt satisfied that Mr B 
would have done anything differently if he had been aware that he would only get £2,223. 
She said she wasnt recommending it pay more than the £50 it had offered for trouble and 
upset.
Mr B didnt agree with the investigator. He said that he had instructed L&G to sell at 11.30am 
on 16 March 2020 and was informed that the sale would be at the next valuation point at 12 
midday. He said he checked at 6pm that evening what the price was at 12 midday and the 
price was shown as £2,553 and knowing the sale was at 12 midday that was what he was 
led to believe he would receive. He said when checking L&Gs website customers rely on the 
figures given and base decisions on these and there was nothing to show the figure could be 
different from the figure shown. He said L&G should honour the figure of £2,553 and not go 
back on its word. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr Bs disappointment that he didnt receive the amount he thought he was 
going to. However, I dont think he is entitled to the difference between the amount he 
thought he was going to get and the amount he did get or any other redress over and above 
the £50 already paid by L&G.
I am satisfied that he has received what he was entitled to, based on the instruction he had 
given to L&G for withdrawal. I acknowledge that he contacted L&G on 16 March 2016 after 
checking the price of his units which showed his units amounting to a total value of £2,553. 
There was a discussion around this figure and based on this he decided he wanted to take 
out £2,400 and leave the balance invested. 
However, the figure of £2,553 was based on the last valuation point on Friday 13 March 
2020 and he was told that he would get the next valuation point which was 12 midday on 16 
March 2016. 
When Mr B checked what the value at 12 midday was  when he got home at 6pm  it still 
showed his investment was valued at £2,553. This was incorrect as the price had dropped at 
the valuation point at 12 midday, but the information hadnt been updated.
The position wasnt clarified when he first spoke to L&G on 17 March 2020, having checked 
and seen the value had dropped to £2,223. As the price at 12 midday still hadnt been 
updated at the time, the person that he spoke to couldnt confirm what Mr B would get. 
But he wasnt told that he was guaranteed to get £2,400 with a balance remaining in the 
investment. L&G did then call him later and confirmed that the figure of £2,223 was right and 
was based on the value as at 12 midday the previous day.
In response to the investigators opinion Mr B said when he got home at 6pm he checked 
what the price was at the 12 midday valuation point and that price still showed £2,553. I am 
satisfied that this was the wrong information and was as a result of the price not being 
updated when it should have been.
However, whilst this may have raised an expectation in Mr B that he would receive the 
£2,400 he wanted  and leave a small amount still invested  his decision to sell wasnt 
obviously based on what he saw at 6pm on 16 March 2020. His decision to sell was made at 
11.30 based on the price at the previous valuation point, and in the knowledge that his sale 
would be priced at the next valuation point.
I am not persuaded that he was told when placing the trade that he was guaranteed to get 
£2,400. The fact that he checked - at 6pm on 16 March 2020 - what the price had been at 
the 12 midday valuation point, shows that he was aware the price could be different from the 
figure he had been given at the time of placing the trade. I say that because if he didnt think 
that, there would have been no reason to check the price. In the circumstances Im not 
persuaded he was misled at the time of making the trade.I think L&G is responsible for Mr Bs subsequent misunderstanding as to what he would get 
arising from the price not being updated when he checked at 6pm on 16 March 2020. L&G 
has said that the price is usually updated on its systems at 4pm, so he should have seen the 
correct figure of £2,223. But any misunderstanding at this point clearly had no bearing on his 
earlier decision to sell.
L&G acknowledges that he wouldnt necessarily have noted that the figure was as at the 
previous valuation point and not 12 midday on 16 March 2020. So, I think he reasonably 
thought at that point that he would receive the £2,400 and was only made aware this wasnt 
the case when L&G telephoned him on 17 March 2020 to confirm the figure was £2,223.  
L&G were unable to clarify the position when he first telephoned on 17 March 2020 and only 
did so later that day.
I am satisfied that the unit value of his units at the next valuation point was 34.27 pence and 
that based on the number of units he held he was only entitled to receive £2,223.75 as a 
result of that. As he had instructed L&G that he wanted to withdraw £2,400, it correctly sold 
all his units. In the circumstances Mr B has received what he is entitled to from his 
investment and isnt due anything more.
L&G has paid him £50 for trouble and upset and I think this is reasonable in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint for the reasons I have set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 July 2021.
