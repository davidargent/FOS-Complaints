The complaint
Mr M complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with BMW Financial 
Services that he signed in December 2018. He complained to the dealer, and then to BMW 
Financial Services, about some issues with the cars diesel additive system and tyres. The 
issue with the diesel additive system was repaired but Mr M continued to have issues with it 
and the dealer offered to replace two tyres and BMW Financial Services agreed to replace 
the other two as a goodwill gesture.
Mr M remained unsatisfied with the car and BMW Financial Services said in January 2020 
that he could reject it and that it would keep his deposit as payment for the excess mileage 
that hed driven. Mr M said that he should receive a refund of all the money that hed paid for 
the car and that BMW Financial Services should deduct an amount for fair usage - which he 
said would leave him with about £2,500. 
He complained to this service and BMW Financial Services offered to pay him £350 as a 
gesture of goodwill. Our investigator concluded that Mr M had been inconvenienced because 
of the length of time that the issue was ongoing and because he had to make multiple trips 
to the dealer  but he said that the £350 offered by BMW Financial Services was in line with 
the level of compensation that hed expect in these circumstances. He couldnt see that 
there was enough evidence to support the amount of compensation that Mr M felt was due 
to him.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary 
that:
BMW Financial Services has told lies and been incompetent in dealing with his 
complaint; 
the job cards show the times that the car was returned to the dealer and another 
manufacturers dealer  and hes provided evidence about the distances that he 
travelled to return the car;
hes been told that BMW Financial Services is given extra time when dealing with 
complaints; and
hes provided evidence of his requests for access to premium replacement cars.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
I dont consider that the evidence shows that BMW Financial Services has lied to 
Mr M or been incompetent in dealing with his complaint  and this service tries to be 
fair to all parties in dealing with a complaint and it doesnt allow BMW Financial 
Services more time to deal with a complaint than would be provided to other 
businesses or consumers in similar circumstances;
BMW Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that 
it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr M was about three and a half years old, had been 
driven for 34,470 miles and had a price of £31,885;
Mr M made an advance payment of £445 and agreed to make 48 monthly payments 
of £499.79 and an optional final repayment of £14,759.72 for the car to be supplied to 
him  and there was an annual mileage limit of 12,000 miles with a charge of 10.22p 
for each mileage in excess of that; 
he complained to the dealer and another manufacturers dealer about some issues 
with the cars diesel additive system and tyres;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality because of its tyres or that the dealer told Mr M that the car had 
new tyres  and the dealer offered to replace two tyres and BMW Financial Services 
agreed to replace the other two as a goodwill gesture;
a fault with the cars diesel additive system has been repaired but the fault continues 
and no further repair was made because Mr M wanted to reject the car;
BMW Financial Services said in January 2020 that Mr M could reject the car  the 
cars mileage at that time was 53,328 and it said that excess mileage charges would 
be £598.69 but it would keep his deposit of £445 as payment for the excess mileage; 
Mr M had been able to use the car to drive 18,858 between December 2018 and 
January 2020  and I consider that its fair and reasonable that he should pay for that 
use  Mr M says that he should receive a refund of all the money that hed paid for 
the car and that BMW Financial Services should deduct an amount for fair usage;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for BMW Financial Services to keep the 
monthly payments that Mr M has made under the agreement for the use that hes 
had from the car (and for it to keep his deposit of £445 as payment for the mileage 
that hes driven in excess of the mileage limits set out in the agreement);
the dealer provided Mr M with replacement cars when he requested them  he says 
that they were demonstrator cars not courtesy cars and were provided to him 
because hed agreed to buy another car but then changed his mind  but Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require BMW Financial Services to refund to him any of his monthly payments because it didnt provide 
those cars to him; 
Mr M stopped making monthly payments to BMW Financial Services and says that it 
recorded the arrears on his credit file which he said stopped him from moving forward 
with plans for him and his family  BMW Financial Services has agreed to remove 
the arrears from his credit file and Im not persuaded that hes provided enough 
evidence to show that hes suffered a financial loss as a result of the information that 
BMW Financial Services recorded on his credit file; and
Mr M has described in detail the distress and inconvenience that he says that hes 
been caused by these events  and I sympathise with him for the issues that hes 
had with the car and the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused  but 
BMW Financial Services has offered to pay him £350 and I consider that to be fair 
and reasonable compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hes been 
caused  and Im not persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified in 
these circumstances.
Putting things right
Mr M has rejected the car and returned it to the dealer and BMW Financial Services says 
that it has ended the hire purchase agreement. It says that it has also removed any adverse 
information about the arrears from his credit file. I consider that to be fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require BMW Financial Services to refund to Mr M the deposit that he paid for the car or any 
of the monthly payments that hes made under the agreement.
These events have caused Mr M some distress and inconvenience. I find that it would be fair 
and reasonable for BMW Financial Services to pay him £350 to compensate him for that 
distress and inconvenience. But Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me 
to require it to pay Mr M a higher amount of compensation than that or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and I order BMW Financial Services 
(GB) Limited to pay him £350 to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that 
hes been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2021.
