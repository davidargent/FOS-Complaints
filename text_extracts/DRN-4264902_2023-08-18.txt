The complaint
Mrs L complains about the advice given by Fairstone Financial Management Limited 
(Fairstone) to transfer the benefits from her defined-benefit (DB) occupational pension 
scheme to a personal pension. The crux of Mrs Ls complaint is that she believes the original 
transfer advice was unsuitable for her and it didnt meet her needs. Mrs L feels shes lost out 
as a result.
What happened
Mrs L approached Fairstone towards the start of 2020 to discuss her pension and retirement 
needs. 
In February 2020 Fairstone completed a fact-find to gather information about Mrs Ls 
circumstances and objectives. Amongst other things this recorded that Mrs L was 52 years 
old; she was married; she was working part-time; she jointly owned her home; she had no 
liabilities; she had around £5,000 in savings; and she wanted to retire early at age 55 on a 
joint income of around £2,000 a month. Fairstone also carried out an assessment of Mrs Ls 
attitude to risk, which it deemed to be balanced. 
On 1 April 2020, Fairstone advised Mrs L to transfer her pension benefits into a personal 
pension and invest the proceeds in a portfolio of funds Fairstone deemed matched Mrs Ls 
attitude to risk. In summary, the suitability report said the reasons for this recommendation 
were
To enable Mrs L the flexibility to draw the level of income she required to bridge the 
gap in the early stages of retirement before reducing it once her state pension and 
her partners pension were payable. 
To provide better death benefits than the DB scheme could provide by allowing any 
unutilised funds to be left to her named beneficiaries.
In 2022 Mrs L complained to Fairstone. She said that it had failed to carry out a 
recommended fund switch following her annual review and she asked for a refund of her 
advice fees. Mrs L also said that the matter had led her to question whether all the advice 
she received from Fairstone was suitable and appropriate for her needs.
Fairstone didnt uphold Mrs Ls complaint. In summary it said that the fund switch was a 
recommendation, which needed Mrs Ls acceptance before it could happen. It acknowledged 
that it shouldve followed things up when it didnt receive Mrs Ls acceptance of the 
recommendation, for which it apologised  but it said it didnt constitute negligence. It said 
because there was no evidence that the advice Mrs L received was in any way negligent or 
inappropriate, it would not be refunding the advice fees. 
It apologised that Mrs L was offered this refund by the adviser prematurely and before an 
investigation into matters had taken place. It offered Mrs L £150 by way of apology.
Dissatisfied with its response, Mrs L referred her complaint to our service.. An investigator 
deemed that Mrs Ls complaint was, at the heart of it, one about the suitability of the original 
advice to transfer her DB pension, so they let Fairstone know and asked it for copies of the 
advice paperwork. The investigator upheld the complaint and required Fairstone to pay 
compensation. In summary they said the advice wasnt suitable. They said Mrs L couldve 
met her objective of wanting to provide her sons with a lump sum each when she was 55-60 
by remaining in her DB scheme; they didnt think Fairstone had done enough to explore the 
option of Mrs L taking early retirement from the DB scheme; death benefits shouldnt have 
been prioritised over providing Mrs L with advice about what was best for her retirement  
there are other products available to cater for this such as whole of life or term assurance; 
and because the critical yield was high, Mrs L wasnt going to improve on the benefits 
available to her through her DB scheme. The investigator added that theyd considered the 
cashflow forecast produced at the time of the advice  but they said this was only a forecast 
and wasnt guaranteed. They said Mrs L didnt have the capacity for loss and she shouldnt 
have been exposed to investment risk. They said if suitable advice had been given to Mrs L 
to remain in the DB scheme, she wouldve likely followed that advice.
The investigator also clarified that, because they were upholding the complaint about the 
suitability of the transfer advice, they didnt need to consider Mrs Ls complaint about the 
alleged failure of Fairstone to carry out the pension investment fund switch.
Fairstone disagreed. It provided a substantive response. And while I have read it in full, I 
havent set out everything here. It said its primary objection was to our consideration of a 
complaint about the suitability of the original transfer advice. It said Mrs L made no mention 
of this in any of her correspondence. It said it isnt fair that Mrs L complained about one 
issue, and then complained to us about a different issue without it being given the 
opportunity to investigate first. It said for this reason, it doesnt believe the complaint is within 
our jurisdiction and it asked this to be determined prior to any merits decision.
Fairstone also set out why it disagreed with the investigators conclusions. In summary it 
said:
The critical yield isnt relevant in this case because Mrs L wasnt looking to match her 
DB scheme benefits. In any event, the shortfall shown in the TVC was discussed with 
her.
Mrs L and her husbands spending was covered from other secure sources. She had 
a need for £6,000 a year from age 55  the cashflow analysis based on matching the 
scheme pension showed as its most pessimistic the funds would run out at age 86. 
But this was only for illustrative purposes because Mrs L didnt need this level of 
income.
Mrs Ls needs would not have been met by taking the scheme pension at 55. Mrs L 
had a stated income need below the schemes pension and she wanted to pass 
funds to her children  she was happy to trade the guaranteed income for flexibility.
Mrs L didnt accept a lower level of benefits, it was her preference.
It did provide life assurance quotes an alternative means of providing death benefits 
 albeit this was of secondary importance to Mrs L as her primary objective was 
flexibility.
It disagreed with the investigator that Mrs Ls capacity for loss was low.
It believed Mrs L was familiar with investments and their associated risk given her 
previous occupation
It believes Mrs L was in a fully informed position to accept the advice.
It doesnt believe the investigator can speculate on what Mrs L would or wouldnt 
have done if it had advised against the transfer and so doesnt believe this is 
relevant.
The investigator wasnt persuaded to change their opinion. In relation to Fairstones point 
about our powers to consider the complaint, they said that email correspondence between 
Mrs L and the adviser showed that she was questioning whether the advice was suitable. So while poor customer service might have been the trigger for Mrs Ls complaint, they said it 
was not a different complaint that was referred to our Service or from that received by 
Fairstone.
The complaint was therefore referred to me to make a final decision.
I can see that Fairstone indicated that it wanted to make further representations  but 
despite being reminded of the deadline for responses of 15 August 2023, it hasnt sent us 
anything more. I think if Fairstone wanted to say anything more it wouldve done so by now  
so in the circumstances I think it is safe for me to proceed with my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken into account relevant law and regulations, regulators rules, guidance and 
standards and codes of practice, and what I consider to have been good industry practice at 
the time. This includes the Principles for Businesses (PRIN) and the Conduct of Business 
Sourcebook (COBS). And where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, 
I reach my conclusions on the balance of probabilities  that is, what I think is more likely 
than not to have happened based on the available evidence and the wider surrounding 
circumstances.
The applicable rules, regulations and requirements
The below is not a comprehensive list of the rules and regulations which applied at the time 
of the advice, but provides useful context for my assessment of BUSINESS's actions here.
PRIN 6: A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
PRIN 7: A firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its clients, and communicate 
information to them in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.
COBS 2.1.1R: A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best 
interests of its client (the client's best interests rule).
The provisions in COBS 9 which deal with the obligations when giving a personal 
recommendation and assessing suitability. And the provisions in COBS 19 which specifically 
relate to a DB pension transfer.
Having considered all of this and the evidence in this case, Ive decided to uphold the 
complaint for largely the same reasons given by the investigator. My reasons are set out 
below.
The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), states in COBS 19.1.6G that the 
starting assumption for a transfer from a DB scheme is that it is unsuitable. 
So, Fairstone should have only considered a transfer if it could clearly demonstrate that the 
transfer was in Mrs Ls best interests. And having looked at all the evidence available, Im 
not satisfied it was in his best interests.
Firstly, Id like to address Fairstones point about the investigator not addressing the 
complaint Mrs L made but instead went on to consider the suitability of the advice, which 
was not a concern Mrs L had raised or something it had been given the opportunity to 
respond to. It says this complaint is therefore not in our jurisdiction.I think the investigator has explained the position clearly. But to clarify - Im satisfied this is a 
complaint I can look at. Our role is to look at the whole picture and think about what lies at 
the heart of a complaint. And Im satisfied that the crux of Mrs Ls complaint is about the 
suitability of the advice she received to transfer her DB scheme pension benefits to a 
personal pension. Just because Mrs L might not have articulated her complaint fully or used 
the language Fairstone might have expected her to use when complaining about the 
suitability of the original transfer advice (notwithstanding that I think Fairstone ought to have 
reasonably understood this from what Mrs L said in her emails to the adviser during the 
course of her complaint) this doesnt mean we cant consider what we feel Fairstone 
shouldve looked at when it considered Mrs Ls complaint. 
Notwithstanding our inquisitorial remit, I can see the investigator told Fairstone that they 
would be looking at the suitability of the transfer advice well before they issued their 
assessment, allowing, in my view, sufficient time for it to investigate and consider the matter. 
While Fairstone chose not to do that, it has set out the reasons why it believes the advice it 
provided to Mrs L was suitable in response to the investigators assessment - so it has 
provided its defence of the case. Im therefore satisfied I can decide this case fairly based on 
the evidence provided by both parties. And Im also satisfied, for the reasons above, that it is 
not necessary for me to separately consider the matter of jurisdiction of this complaint 
before providing my final decision about the merits of it.
Financial viability 
While I agree with the investigator that the transfer wasnt financially viable because it was 
highly unlikely the annual growth rate of 16.62% required to match Mrs Ls DB scheme 
benefits at her preferred retirement age of 55 was achievable, as Fairstone has said, it didnt 
recommend the transfer to try and improve on Mrs Ls benefits or because it thought Mrs L 
would be better off in retirement by doing so. It recommended it for other reasons, which I 
will discuss below. So I dont think it is necessary for me to expand on my reasons why I 
dont think the transfer was financially viable. 
But I want to take the opportunity here of highlighting my concerns about Fairstones 
assessment of Mrs Ls willingness to adopt a balanced attitude to risk with her pension 
monies and its classification of her as an experienced investor. Im not persuaded Mrs L was 
either given her circumstances at the time. Its not entirely clear to me how Fairstone 
assessed and arrived at Mrs Ls attitude to risk - but she had no prior direct investment 
experience, any money she had was in cash and at 52 approaching the tail end of her career 
based on her preferred retirement age, she had limited opportunity to replace capital. It 
strikes me that Mrs Ls circumstances better described someone who ought to be taking a 
cautious or low risk approach. 
As for Mrs L being an experienced investor and Fairstones argument that Mrs L was familiar 
with investments and their associated risk - despite its belief this was the case, the advice 
paperwork also records that Mrs L didnt see herself that way. And based on Mrs Ls 
circumstances as Ive described above, I think the evidence supports that. 
Fairstone appears to have placed significant weight on Mrs Ls previous occupation within 
the financial services sector and her job title. But this was around 10 years prior to the 
advice and Mrs L has said her role did not involve her giving advice on or discussing 
investments. She said anything related to that was referred to a specialist because she 
wasnt qualified to do so. So while Mrs L might have had a basic understanding of 
investments and the concept of risk, I dont think it is fair or reasonable for Fairstone to have 
assumed Mrs L was an experienced investor purely based on her previous role and job title.In any event, as I will go on to explain below, Im not persuaded there was any real need for 
Mrs L to take any risk with her DB scheme benefits to achieve her retirement objectives.
Flexibility and income need
The primary reason Fairstone appears to have recommended the transfer was to provide 
Mrs L with flexibility - the ability for her to draw the level of income she required to bridge the 
gap in the early stages of retirement before reducing it once her state pension and her 
partners pension were payable.
But Im not persuaded Mrs L had a genuine need for flexibility  I think it was simply a 
feature or a consequence of moving to a personal pension arrangement.
Mrs L indicated that she wanted to retire at 55, so before her DB schemes normal retirement 
age of 60. Firstly, Mrs L didnt need to transfer her DB scheme benefits to enable her to 
retire early  she already had that option available to her. I accept Mrs L couldnt take her 
DB scheme benefits flexibly. While she could opt to take a cash lump sum and a reduced 
income, she had to take these at the same time. But Mrs L doesnt appear to have had a 
genuine need to access her tax-free cash and leave her funds invested until a later date.
Fairstone recorded that Mrs L wanted to give her children some money  around £10,000 
each. But because this was a gift as such and not something that was timebound  i.e. there 
wasnt a fixed time or date by which Mrs L had to do this - I see no reason why she couldnt 
have done this at the same time as taking her income from her DB scheme  whether that 
was at age 55 or anytime up to her normal retirement age. I think Mrs L couldve commuted 
some of her DB scheme income for a £20,000 lump sum and still had sufficient income to 
meet her needs, as I will set out below. So I dont think Mrs L needed flexibility this way.
While Fairstone didnt carry out what I consider to be a comprehensive income and 
expenditure analysis in retirement, Mrs Ls initial (joint) income need at 55 was deemed to be 
£1,500 net a month - £1,000 of which would come from her husbands earning as he still 
intended to continue working. So Mrs L needed around £500 net a month from her pension. 
Because Mrs Ls income need was lower than her DB scheme income would provide, 
Fairstone recommended the transfer as it would allow Mrs L to only draw the income she 
needed to bridge the gap until her state pension and her husbands DB pension were 
payable, whereupon she could reduce it further (or cease it altogether based on Fairstones 
cashflow modelling.)
I accept that transferring to a personal pension would allow Mrs L to control the level of 
income she took and that it appears she needed less than her DB scheme pension would 
pay her at 55. While Mrs Ls DB scheme trustees wouldnt provide an early retirement quote, 
Fairstones analysis using reasonable assumptions indicated shed likely be entitled to 
around £10,200 a year. But just because Mrs Ls DB scheme income was greater than her 
initial need and that when her state pension, her current occupational pension and her 
husbands pension became payable it would result in surplus income, this is not in my view, 
a compelling reason to justify a transfer out of the scheme. 
I do not consider that surplus income is detrimental. This is because Mrs L could use that 
extra income to improve her standard of living, she could save it, or she could use it to gift to 
her children as it appears was her wish.
Ultimately I think Mrs Ls needs couldve been satisfied by remaining in the DB scheme  I 
see no reason why Mrs L needed to take on investment risk by transferring out of the 
scheme altogether to achieve things.I can see that Fairstones cash modelling showed that by having control over the amount of 
income she took, it was possible for Mrs L to cease drawing an income altogether from her 
fund once her state pension became payable at 67. But as I will go on to discuss in more 
detail below, this appears to have been produced to demonstrate how Mrs L could also meet 
her objective of wanting to pass on any unused pension monies to her children / family. But I 
dont think this was a suitable reason for the transfer either. 
Overall, Im not persuaded it was in Mrs Ls best interests to transfer her DB pension 
benefits to achieve flexibility that Im not persuaded she really needed.
Death benefits
Fairstone says that better death benefits was a secondary objective of Mrs Ls. But it 
nevertheless appears to have been a key reason why it recommended Mrs L transfer her DB 
scheme benefits. The suitability report recorded that Mrs L was aware she could leave her 
DB scheme as she didnt need immediate access to it  but that if she was to die, this would 
leave her husband with a 50% spouses pension, which would not be sufficient for his income 
needs once he retires and little or no provision for the benefit of her children, which was one 
of the key drivers behind you wanting to secure the transfer value now.
Death benefits are an emotive subject and of course when asked, most people would like 
their loved ones to be taken care of when they die. The lump sum death benefits on offer 
through a personal pension was likely an attractive feature to Mrs L. But whilst I appreciate 
death benefits are important to consumers, and Mrs L might have thought it was a good idea 
to transfer her DB scheme to a personal pension because of this, the priority here was to 
advise Mrs L about what was best for her retirement provisions. In my view, a pension is 
primarily designed to provide income in retirement  not as a legacy planning tool.
I also think the existing death benefits attached to the DB scheme were underplayed. Mrs L 
was married and so the spouses pension provided by the DB scheme wouldve been useful 
to her spouse if Mrs L predeceased him. And unlike the adviser, I think it wouldve provided 
a sufficient income to meet his needs once he retired. It might not have fully met his needs, 
but he had his own DB pension, his state pension and likely a spouses benefits from Mrs Ls 
current workplace pension. I dont think Fairstone made the value of this benefit clear 
enough to Mrs L. This was guaranteed and it escalated  it was not dependent on 
investment performance, whereas the sum remaining on death in a personal pension was. 
And as one of the scenarios Fairstone produced in its cashflow analysis shows, the potential 
existed for there not to have been a large sum left/the fund may have been depleted - 
particularly if Mrs L lived a long life.  In any event, Fairstone should not have encouraged 
Mrs L to prioritise the potential for higher death benefits through a personal pension over her 
security in retirement.
Im mindful that Mrs L already appears to have had lump sum death benefits available 
through her current workplace pension. And ultimately her children likely stood to inherit the 
family home. But if Mrs L genuinely wanted to leave a legacy for her children, which didnt 
depend on investment returns or how much of her pension fund remained on her death, I 
think Fairstone shouldve instead explored life insurance. 
I appreciate that the suitability report mentioned a whole of life policy as well as a term 
assurance policy both with sum assureds of around £422,000. 
This was apparently discounted by Mrs L for around eight reasons bullet pointed in the 
suitability report. In addition Mrs L didnt want an additional cost. But I dont think that this 
was a balanced way of presenting this option to Mrs L.Basing the quote on the transfer value of Mrs Ls pension benefits essentially assumed that 
she would pass away on day one following the transfer, and that isnt realistic. Ultimately, 
Mrs L wanted to leave whatever remained of her pension to her children, which could be a 
lot less than this if she lived a long life, if investment returns were poor and/or she did draw 
more income than was modelled. So, the starting point ought to have been to ask Mrs L how 
much she would ideally like to leave to her children, after taking account of the existing 
means listed above, and this couldve been explored on a whole of life or term assurance 
basis, which was likely to be cheaper and more affordable to provide. I think this is what 
ought to have been ultimately recommended to Mrs L to meet this objective.
Overall, I dont think different death benefits available through a transfer to a personal 
pension was a compelling reason to transfer. And I dont think that insurance was properly or 
fairly explored as an alternative.
Suitability of investments
Because Im not persuaded that Mrs L was a truly balanced risk investor, I dont think the 
investment recommendation was suitable. But as Im upholding the complaint on the 
grounds that a transfer out of the DB scheme wasnt suitable for Mrs L, it follows that I dont 
need to consider the suitability of the investment recommendation. This is because Mrs L 
should have been advised to remain in the DB scheme and so the investments wouldnt 
have arisen if suitable advice had been given.
Likewise, and as the investigator clarified, Mrs Ls complaint about the alleged failure of 
Fairstone to carry out the recommended fund switches falls away in light of my findings 
above.
Summary
I dont doubt that the flexibility, control and potential for higher death benefits on offer 
through a personal pension would have sounded like attractive features to Mrs L. But 
Fairstone wasnt there to just transact what Mrs L might have thought she wanted. The 
advisers role was to really understand what Mrs L needed and recommend what was in her 
best interests.
I accept that the suitability report provided detailed information and Fairstone says that Mrs L 
watched several videos so she understood the pros and cons of transferring. But ultimately 
Fairstones advice needed to be suitable and I dont think the advice given to Mrs L was 
suitable. Mrs L was giving up a guaranteed, risk-free and increasing income. And in my view, 
there were no particular reasons which would justify a transfer. Mrs L shouldnt have been 
advised to transfer out of the scheme just to have flexibility that Im not persuaded she really 
needed, and the potential for higher death benefits wasnt worth giving up the guarantees 
associated with her DB scheme. I think Mrs L couldve met her objectives by remaining in 
the DB scheme  Im not persuaded she needed to accept investment risk and transfer her 
scheme benefits to achieve things.
So, I think Fairstone shouldve advised Mrs L to remain in her DB scheme.
Of course, I have to consider whether Mrs L would've gone ahead anyway, against 
Fairstones advice.
 
I can see in response to the investigators assessment Fairstone said it doesnt believe the 
investigator can speculate on what Mrs L would or wouldnt have done if it had advised 
against the transfer and so doesnt believe this is relevant. But it is relevant because it is 
necessary for me to consider causation. And rather than speculate, Ive considered all of the relevant evidence to determine what I think would most likely have happened had Fairstone 
provided Mrs L with suitable advice. 
Having done so, Im not persuaded that Mrs L wouldve insisted on transferring out of the DB 
scheme, against Fairstones advice. I say this because, as I said above, despite Fairstones 
assessment of Mrs L, Im not persuaded she was an experienced investor or someone who 
possessed the requisite skill, knowledge or confidence to go against the advice they were 
given, particularly in complex pension matters. Mrs Ls pension accounted for the majority of 
her private retirement provision and I think her true attitude to risk was lower than that 
assessed by Fairstone. So, if Fairstone had provided her with clear advice against 
transferring out of the DB scheme, explaining why it wasnt in her best interests, I think she 
wouldve accepted that advice.
Im not persuaded that Mrs Ls concerns about her death benefits were so great that she 
wouldve insisted on the transfer knowing that a professional adviser, whose expertise she 
had sought out and was paying for, didnt think it was suitable for her or in her best interests. 
If Fairstone had explained that Mrs L could meet all of her objectives without risking her 
guaranteed pension, I think that wouldve carried significant weight. So, I dont think Mrs L 
would have insisted on transferring out of the DB scheme.
In light of the above, I think Fairstone should compensate Mrs L for the unsuitable advice, 
using the regulator's defined benefits pension transfer redress methodology. 
Putting things right
A fair and reasonable outcome would be for the business to put Mrs L as far as possible, into 
the position she would now be in but for the unsuitable advice. I consider Mrs L would have 
most likely remained in the occupational pension scheme if suitable advice had been given. 
Fairstone must therefore undertake a redress calculation in line with the rules for calculating 
redress for non-compliant pension transfer advice, as detailed in policy statement PS22/13 
and set out in the regulators handbook in DISP App 4: 
https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/DISP/App/4/?view=chapter. 
For clarity, Mrs L has not yet retired, and she has no plans to do so at present. So, 
compensation should be based on the schemes normal retirement age of 60, as per the 
usual assumptions in the FCA's guidance.
This calculation should be carried out using the most recent financial assumptions in line 
with PS22/13 and DISP App 4. In accordance with the regulators expectations, this should 
be undertaken or submitted to an appropriate provider promptly following receipt of 
notification of Mrs Ls acceptance of the decision.
If the redress calculation demonstrates a loss, as explained in policy statement PS22/13 and 
set out in DISP App 4, Fairstone should:
calculate and offer Mrs L redress as a cash lump sum payment,
explain to Mrs L before starting the redress calculation that:
- their redress will be calculated on the basis that it will be invested prudently 
(in line with the cautious investment return assumption used in the 
calculation), and
- a straightforward way to invest their redress prudently is to use it to augment 
their DC pension
offer to calculate how much of any redress Mrs L receives could be augmented rather than receiving it all as a cash lump sum,
if Mrs L accepts Fairstones offer to calculate how much of their redress could be 
augmented, request the necessary information and not charge Mrs L for the 
calculation, even if she ultimately decides not to have any of their redress 
augmented, and
take a prudent approach when calculating how much redress could be augmented, 
given the inherent uncertainty around Mrs Ls end of year tax position.
Redress paid to Mrs L as a cash lump sum includes compensation in respect of benefits that 
would otherwise have provided a taxable income. So, in line with DISP App 4, Fairstone may 
make a notional deduction to cash lump sum payments to take account of tax that 
consumers would otherwise pay on income from their pension. Typically, 25% of the loss 
could have been taken as tax-free cash and 75% would have been taxed according to Mrs 
Ls likely income tax rate in retirement  presumed to be 20%. So making a notional 
deduction of 15% overall from the loss adequately reflects this. 
Where I uphold a complaint, I can award fair compensation of up to £375,000, plus any
interest and/or costs that I consider are appropriate. Where I consider that fair compensation
requires payment of an amount that might exceed £375,000, I may recommend that the
business pays the balance.
My final decision
Determination and money award: I uphold this complaint and require Fairstone Financial 
Management Limited to pay Mrs L the compensation amount as set out in the steps above, 
up to a maximum of £375,000.
Recommendation: If the compensation amount exceeds £375,000, I also recommend that 
Fairstone Financial Management Limited pays Mrs L the balance.
If Mrs L accepts this decision, the money award becomes binding on Fairstone Financial 
Management Limited.
My recommendation would not be binding. Further, its unlikely that Mrs L can accept my 
decision and go to court to ask for the balance. Mrs L may want to consider getting 
independent legal advice before deciding whether to accept any final decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2023.
