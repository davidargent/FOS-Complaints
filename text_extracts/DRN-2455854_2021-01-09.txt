The complaint
Mr N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly excluded him from its 
branch.
What happened
Mr N says he went to a NatWest branch and was unable to pay his credit card bill as 
NatWest couldnt identify him. He says he returned the following day but was told he was 
banned from the branch due to the incident the day before. Mr N says he wasnt abusive in 
branch or aggressive. He would like a full apology and access to a branch as well as a 
goodwill gesture. Mr N accepts he has a loud voice.
NatWest says Mr N become aggressive in his tone when he attended its branch and so 
made the decision to exclude him from the branch. It says Mr N can now attend its branch.
Mr N brought his complaint to us, but our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought we were not NatWests regulator and so it was not our role to tell NatWest how it 
deals with these issues. The investigator didnt think any video evidence would provide 
evidence of what took place as it is unlikely it would contain sound and also thought Mr N 
was now able to attend the branch.
Mr N doesnt accept that view and in summary says the onus is on NatWest to prove he 
acted as they allege and says the burden of proof is on NatWest. He has also made of list of 
questions he would like NatWest to answer and disputes it told him he was aggressive in 
branch.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint. I appreciate that Mr N will be disappointed with my decision and I also appreciate 
how strongly he feels about this complaint.
I dont think it possible to be sure what took place in branch as both sides provide different 
versions of events. I dont think it matters that a video is not available as its unlikely it would 
have had sound. And I make clear to Mr N that we are not a court and we dont require 
NatWest to prove its case as Mr N suggests.
Im satisfied that its up to NatWest to decide what steps it takes in these circumstances and 
its up to it to decide with whom it has a business relationship. But in any event NatWest has 
said Mr N can attend its branch. I dont think it necessary to ask NatWest to answer the 
questions Mr N has raised. I think it inevitable NatWest will say Mr N acted inappropriately 
and Mr N will no doubt maintain he did not. I have made clear that I cant fairly conclude 
what took place.
I appreciate Mr N says he has a hearing difficulty, but he accepts NatWest was unaware of 
that and so it would be unable to make any reasonable adjustments if necessary. No doubt 
Mr N will tell NatWest that, if he wishes to continue his banking relationship with it, and if he 
intends to attend the branch in question again.
I also appreciate Mr N questions why NatWest didnt say he was aggressive in branch. But I 
can see NatWests final response letter uses that term and Mr N told us that is what he was 
accused of in his complaint form. So, Im satisfied NatWest has made clear what its issue 
was with Mr N and that he must have known that as he told us that is what NatWest said 
was the reason for the branch exclusion.
Overall, I cant fairly conclude NatWest has acted unfairly or in a discriminatory manner. I 
accept that its unlikely Mr N will accept my decision, but Im satisfied this brings an end to 
what we in trying to resolve this dispute informally can do.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2021.
