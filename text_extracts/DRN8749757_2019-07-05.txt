K821x#15Complaint
Mr F has complained about short-term  loans granted  to him by CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading 
as QuickQuid. Mr F says he couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid  didnt take 
appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
Background
QuickQuid agreed eleven  short-term loans  for Mr F between  September 2014 and July 2017. 
Each loan was repayable over between two and three months. 
Several of Mr Fs loans were topped up, sometimes on more  than one occasion.  This is 
where he took out further borrowing under the same  agreement,  before paying  back the 
initial amount  borrowed.  He also re-financed  loan 4, this is where he took out further  
borrowing, extending the term of the agreement,  and rescheduling the remaining payments. 
Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Fs complaint already. She only reviewed the 
sale of loans 1  4 and loan 8, as at the point the complaint was being assessed, QuickQuid 
had already agreed to refund the interest and charges Mr F paid on loans 5  7 and 
loans 9  11 in line with our approach. And based  on her review, she recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. 
She initially thought  that the checks QuickQuid  carried out on loans  1  3 were 
proportionate, but she thought that checks carried out on loans 4 and 8 were not. She 
thought that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks  on these  loans, it wouldve 
likely concluded that loans 4 and 8 wouldve  been  unaffordable for Mr F, and therefore,  as a 
responsible lender, QuickQuid would not have agreed to them.
Ref: DRN87497572She also initially thought, that from the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loan 1, it shouldve  
seen that this loan wouldve also have been  unaffordable for Mr F. However  after a further 
review, she has since  revised  her opinion on this matter  as she thought loan 1 should  no 
longer be upheld and informed Mr F accordingly.  
At the point this case has come to me as on ombudsman, Mr F has accepted the 
adjudicators findings.  QuickQuid however has disagreed with the findings. So as no 
agreements been  reached at this stage, the case  has come  to me, as an ombudsman, for a 
final decision.
As it seems loans 1  3; loans 5  7; and loans 9  11 are no longer in dispute; my decision 
will focus on QuickQuids decision to approve  the remaining  loans  loans 4 and 8. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate checks when  Mr F 
applied for his loans.  These checks seem to have  included asking Mr F for information about 
his income and expenditure, and for loan 8, comparing the information provided  by Mr F, 
against data from the Office of National Statistics. Based on its checks  it felt it was 
reasonable to lend to Mr F.
The adjudicators opinion set out in detail, why he thought  Mr Fs case should  be upheld  in 
part, which Ive summarised above.
QuickQuid, in response to the adjudicators opinion, said amongst other things, that starting  
1 March 2015, it had implemented an affordability review that was consistent  with the FCA 
(Financial Conduct  Authority) Handbook  and was in place at the time it received  
authorisation by the FCA. And that its assessment was conducted properly and individually 
for each  of these applications after this date.
QuickQuid has raised  this generic argument across  many cases  brought  to our service. And 
this service has addressed this  specific point by QuickQuid  in several previous decisions, so I 
wont expand on it any further  here.  As by now, QuickQuid will be aware  that my role is to 
look not only into the rules  and regulations  set by the regulator  at the time of borrowing, but 
also the law, good industry  practice  and all the available evidence and arguments, to help 
decide whether  I think what  the business  has done is right or not.  So my decision will focus  
on the specifics of Mr Fs complaint and what both parties have said about this.
Having looked  at the specifics in this case,  I dont  think QuickQuid was right to provide Mr F 
with some of his loans.  Ill explain  why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Fs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
Ref: DRN87497573the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Fs complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr F would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks  have 
shown that Mr F would have been able to do so?
When Mr F applied for loan 4, hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for around seven 
months. So by now,  I think QuickQuid shouldve been gaining  a full understanding  of Mr Fs 
financial commitments, including his short-term credit commitments before  agreeing  to lend 
any further funds  at this stage. 
QuickQuid recorded  Mr Fs monthly  income as £1,542 when he applied  for loan 4. But had it 
carried out proportionate checks, I think it wouldve seen  that in addition the £1,025  it had 
recorded for his outgoings, he also owed a further  £325 to other short- term lenders at this 
time. This meant that his disposable monthly  income  was actually closer to £190  a month.
Given that the highest monthly repayment due on loan 4 was around £250,  proportionate 
checks wouldve shown QuickQuid that the repayments on loan 4 were not sustainably 
affordable for Mr F. And therefore as a responsible lender, I dont  think  QuickQuid wouldve 
agreed to this loan or the subsequent re-finance knowing this.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ref: DRN87497574Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive  looked to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point 
was already reached by the time he applied for loan 8. I say this because:
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid at this point. 
And was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
the amount  Mr F was borrowing had steadily been increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably 
I think that Mr F lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Fs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loan 8 because the overall pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr F in some 
other way.  
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuid should have approved loans  4 or 8 for Mr F, and I think  
Mr F lost out as a result. 
What QuickQuid needs to do to put things right 
QuickQuid has already agreed  to remove any interest and charges Mr F paid towards loans 
5  7; and loans 9  11 including  any top-ups or re-finances of these loans, so it should still 
do this.
I also think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loans 4 and 8. So it needs to refund all 
the interest and charges Mr F paid towards  these.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  4  11, including  all top-ups and 
re-finances of these loans;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*; 
Ref: DRN87497575-remove any negative information  about loans 4 7, including  all top-ups and 
re-finances from Mr Fs credit  file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 11, including  top-ups and 
re-finances should be removed from Mr Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Fs complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
