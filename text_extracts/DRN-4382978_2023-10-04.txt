The complaint
D complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) converted a USD inward payment to 
GBP.
What happened
D had a Barclays business account. Ds director sold some shares in a company. The
amount received was USD581,762. This was received by Barclays and converted into GBP
on 18 March 2022. The GBP credit was £439,377.69. The rate was 1.324.
Ds director (who I will refer to as Mr C) complained. He said he had given instructions to
Barclays relationship manager that USD were to be held in a bank account in USD and not
converted to GBP. He said he advised Barclays the payment was to be in USD. At no time
was he told that D would need to open a USD currency account. The situation wasnt helped
by the fact that Barclays changed the RM in January 2022  and he left Barclays in April
2022.
Ds director evidenced call logs to and from his phones to show the calls between himself
and Barclays. He said the exchange rate losses were £64,050 as at December 2022.
Barclays said the communications between the bank and Mr C indicated that Barclays could
accept a USD payment into a GBP account, but that would be converted into GBP as the
account could only hold GBP. The only way for USD not to be converted is to have the
payment paid into a USD account. When payments are received in another currency, the
amount is automatically converted at the prevailing exchange rate. Barclays couldnt find any
evidence to say Mr C was advised that the payment wouldnt be converted. Barclays listened
to one call  on 19 January 2022, and on that, the call handler said the payment would be
converted. Barclays didnt uphold the complaint.
D brought its complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclays acted reasonably and didnt
uphold the complaint. He listened to the calls on 19 January 2022 and 3 February 2022 
and found no evidence that D was advised that the funds would not be converted to
GBP.
Our investigator said - on the call on 19 January 2022, the call handler said the amount
would be converted, and the calls on 3 February 2022 and 24 February 2022 were
inconclusive. Barclays terms and condition also say that non-GBP payments will be
converted into GBP.
D's director didnt agree and asked that the complaint be looked at by an ombudsman, so it
has come to me to do that.
I made a provisional decision which said:
Barclays terms and conditions say Payments into your account: Well convert the payment
into the currency of your account. To do this, we use the Barclays reference exchange rate
plus a margin, which creates the exchange rate. So, these are clear - Barclays will convert
non-GBP payments into GBP.
But thats not the end of the story. The crux of this complaint is the communications between
Mr C (for D) and Barclays, and whether Barclays acted reasonably here.
I reviewed the emails between Barclays and Mr C. The relevant one is dated 24 February
2022  this included Funds will be paid in USD. Of itself, I dont think its reasonable for me
to conclude that meant Mr C wanted to hold the funds in USD after they were received.
Mr C has provided a log of calls between himself and Barclays. We asked Barclays for all
calls and a call log to ensure we had all the information. Barclays provided calls as follows
(and I listened to them):
19 January 2022: Mr C advised the large payment was to arrive and wanted to ensure the
account of D could receive it  as it was to be in USD. Barclays call handler confirmed the
account could receive such a payment and said:..it will come in in USD into the sterling
account and (it will) convert over if that makes sense Mr C said thats good to know
So  at that time, Barclays made a reference that a conversion to GBP would be needed.
But  I think its reasonable to say that this first call was about general information gathering
 and whether the account could receive an inward payment. I dont think its reasonable for
Barclays to rely on this call as evidence to argue that Mr C was told that a currency
conversion would take place, and to dismiss his complaint.
3 February 2022: This is the important call in the context of this complaint. Mr C advised his
RM that the USD payment of around 0.5M USD was to arrive in the next four weeks and he
had confirmed (previously) that the account was set up to receive USD. He then said he
wanted to hold it in USD and at some stage convert it into sterling
He then said he didnt want it eating up foreign exchangeso (I want) to hold it in USD for a
while Barclays didnt say this call had been listened to in their final response letter  so it
appears Barclays didnt consider this call when investigating Ds complaint. So here, having
listened to the call  Im satisfied that Mr C told Barclays that he wanted to hold the funds in
USD. Mr C was specific and precise in what he said.
Barclays RM then went onto discuss savings and investments with Mr C and there was no
further reference to the payment itself. Mr C said he intended to make some GBP
investments with the money. But - I think its reasonable to have expected Barclays to have
told Mr C that the current account couldnt be used to hold USD  and that to do so, D
needed to open a currency account in USD. And  then arrange that or provide the guidance 
for D to do that.
24 February 2022: Mr C called the RM. He said closure of the transaction was imminent. Mr
C said, the payment will come through in USD, so I wanted to be clear that nothing will be
rejected or sent back or whateverthe funds will (then) sit in the account.. The call then
went on to discuss what Barclays would need to do to receive the money  i.e. their
regulatory checks. So this call  was about ensuring the funds would be received into the
account and not returned to the sender.
Mr C says there are other calls, but weve seen Barclays call logs and there arent any
others.
On the call on 19 January 2022  Barclays made a comment that the funds would be
converted to GBP. But in the call on 3 February 2022 - Mr C told Barclays he wanted to hold
the USD in that currency. I consider that the call on 3 February 2022 is more important than
the earlier call. And on it, Mr C told Barclays that he wanted to hold the funds in USD. I
therefore would have expected Barclays RM to have picked that up and advised Mr C that aGBP account could not hold USD and told him a USD currency account was needed. But
unfortunately, he didnt.
I now need to establish what Ds reasonable losses were. Mr C argues that the GBP/USD
exchange rate was such that the losses were GBP68,224 on 15 September 2022  when his
solicitors wrote to Barclays, and the losses increased to GBP73,912 on 18 October 2022.
But I dont think its reasonable to accept these figures  as there is no evidence to suggest
that the USD wouldve been held until that time. I need to establish a methodology that is fair
and reasonable to both D and Barclays  based on what happened or was likely to happen
in the circumstances. I say that as the core principle of this service is to put a customer back
in the position they wouldve been in had the error not occurred.
Looking at Mr Cs calculations:
- Mr C has used an average exchange rate  and the important rate to be used is
Barclays spot rate for converting USD to GBP. This will be different to the rates used
by him.
- I dont think its reasonable to assume that Mr C wouldve held the USD until that
time. I heard him say on the call on 3 February 2022 that he intended to invest in
GBP with the money. He wasnt specific about when and how much. But I can see
from Ds statements that payments totalling £300,000 were made (in GBP) by
October 2022. There had also been another payment of £100,000 on 6 April 2022.
- The payments/investments were:
Date Amount Payment
6 April 2022 £100,000 Transfer/payment
28 April 2022 £50,000 Investment Fund
13 May 2022 £25,000 Investment Fund
24 May 2022 £25,000 Investment Fund
14 June 2022 £25,000 Investment Fund
17 June 2022 £50,000 Investment Fund
24 June 2022 £80,000 Investment Fund
14 July 2022 £25,000 Investment Fund
18 October 2022 £20,000 Investment Fund
Total £400,000
So - it appears that a lot of the money wouldve been converted to GBP to make
those investments /payments. So  for those reasons, I think it is fair to calculate Ds
losses by assuming D wouldve opened a USD currency account to receive the USD
in March 2022. And then  convert the USD to GBP on the dates shown (and for the
amounts of investments made) by reference to the rates as at each date.- That leaves £39,377 to be accounted for. I will take views from either D or Barclays
as to how to deal with this. Mr C (for D) might like to evidence how that money was
used and when - which I will consider. But otherwise, I am minded to not deal with
any loss on that amount .
I am proposing to uphold this complaint. And ask Barclays to:
- Calculate the conversion of each payment as per the schedule at Barclays spot rate
on the dates shown by comparison to the rate used on 18 March 2022 (1.324) and
refund the difference.
Responses to the provisional decision:
Barclays accepted it. Ds director also did, with the following comments (in summary):
- He said he had spent more than £3,000 in legal fees, which couldve been avoided if 
Barclays had resolved the complaint when it was put to them. He said these should 
be reimbursed.
- On the remaining £39,377  he showed evidence that a further purchase if GBP was 
made on 29 December 2022, bringing the total purchase of GBP to £425,000. So  
that should be taken into account.
I now need to consider these comments and make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On the legal fees, as a principle, our service doesnt agree to the reimbursement of such 
fees  on the basis that it was Ds directors decision to use solicitors. Complaint handling 
services at firms (and our service) do not normally need such services to reach fair 
decisions. So  I set this point aside. 
On the further purchase of GBP25,000, I agree that it is reasonable to include this in the 
refund calculations and we put this to Barclays to work out the relevant refund.
Putting things right
Barclays calculated the refund to be USD28,900 as follows:
- £425,000 was converted at the (original) rate of 1.324 = USD562,700.
- £425,000 should have been converted at 1.256 (average weighted customer rate 
across the ten transactions) = USD533,800.
So  Ds loss is USD562,700 less USD533,800 = USD28,900.
We have looked at Barclays calculations and are satisfied they are reasonable.In responding to this final decision, Ds director should advise how he wants to refund to be 
paid  in USD or GBP. If GBP, it will be converted at Barclays customer spot rate as at the 
date of settlement.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Barclays Bank UK PLC must:
- Refund the exchange loss of USD 28,900. Ds director should advise how he wishes 
this to be paid  in USD or GBP.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2023.
