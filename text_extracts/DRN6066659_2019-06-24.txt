K820x#14complaint
Mr K complained that his National Westminster Bank Plc debit card wouldnt work when he 
was on holiday.
background
Mr K told us that he went into a branch of NatWest  and told it that he was going overseas on 
holiday, and told it exactly where he was going. He said that when he got there, his card 
wouldnt work. Hed used  cash he took with him for the first three  or four days, but then he 
couldnt get money out. He told us hed checked that he had money in the account before he 
left, but he couldnt get the money. He said that he couldnt eat, pay for his hotel, or buy his 
ticket to come back.
Mr K said that hed tried calling NatWest but it was difficult due to the time difference. He 
said he didnt have  online banking.  Mr K said hed had to borrow money to return  from 
overseas, and would  now have to go back to the location hed been visiting  to pay back  the 
person hed borrowed money  from. Mr K said that his card worked when he got back to the 
UK. 
NatWest said that it could see that Mr K had been  into a branch before he went  on holiday,  
but he hadnt been able to give precise  details  of his travel plans, so it had put general notes 
on his file, not noted him as being in a specific country at specific  times. 
NatWest said that some  transactions had been  denied while  Mr K was overseas. NatWest 
said that individual transactions can still be blocked  when a card user is overseas, even if 
theyve told NatWest where they are going. But NatWest said that Mr Ks card was never 
actually blocked,  so he didnt need to get in touch with it. 
NatWest said that the reason Mr Ks transactions were denied was that he was trying  to use 
a chip and pin card in ATMs that only read the magnetic stripe on the card. Those  
transactions are higher  risk, and so they are more likely to be refused. NatWest  said that 
next time,  Mr K might like to look for an ATM  at a bank branch, as they are more likely to 
read the chip on a card.  
NatWest told us that it had paid Mr K £30 as a gesture of goodwill, but it didnt think  it had 
done anything  wrong.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold this complaint. She said that NatWest  had noted that Mr K was 
overseas. But she said that NatWest  could still block payments if it thought that was 
necessary. So there was no guarantee that payments or withdrawals would be accepted 
while Mr K was overseas.  
Our adjudicator said that NatWest was sorry it had told Mr K that there  was a fraud block on 
his card while he was away.  There wasnt. NatWest had now explained what  had gone 
wrong. Our adjudicator said that problems with the level of security offered by ATMs can be 
more common in certain parts of the world. NatWest had suggested how Mr K might  avoid 
such problems in future. 
Our adjudicator said that she knew Mr K said that he hadnt been able to contact NatWest  
while he was away, but NatWest does provide a 24 hour helpline, and puts a contact number 
Ref: DRN60666592on its cards  to call it from outside of the UK. It had told Mr K how to contact it, if he should  
ever have such problems  again.
Our adjudicator thought that the £30 goodwill gesture that NatWest had provided was 
reasonable. She didnt think that NatWest  needed to do anything more  to provide a fair 
outcome to this complaint. 
Mr K didnt agree with that. He wanted  his complaint to be considered  by an ombudsman  so 
it was passed  to me for the final stage in our considerations of his complaint. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
on this complaint as our adjudicator, and for broadly the same reasons.
Mr K said he asked  NatWest to note that he was overseas, but he still ended  up with a 
number of transactions being refused. But what NatWest has told us makes me think  that 
the problems that Mr K experienced werent anything to do with whether a holiday flag had 
been placed on his account  or not.
 
ATM transactions can be less secure  in some areas  of the world than others, and NatWest 
still has to take steps to keep Mr Ks money secure. This is especially a problem when 
someones in a country where many  of the ATMs  only match the pin against information held 
on the magnetic  stripe  to make withdrawals,  and dont read the chip.  I understand that Mr K 
was in one of these countries. Ive seen  the reasons that NatWest refused these 
transactions, and I think that this is why Mr K had problems accessing his money.
I know that Mr K had difficulty contacting NatWest, but I havent seen anything  to suggest 
that was NatWests fault. I note that NatWest  has given  Mr K some  advice on avoiding  
problems like this in future. And its paid him £30 to make up for the inconvenience.
I know that Mr K will be disappointed, but I dont think  that whats gone wrong here is 
NatWests fault. So, like our adjudicator, I dont think it has to do anything  more to make up 
for this. I know how disappointed Mr K will be by this, but I dont think  his complaint should  
be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.
