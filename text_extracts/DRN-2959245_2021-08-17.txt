The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wouldnt refund his money on 
a disputed purchase.
What happened
On 22 January 2021, Mr C bought some heaters for EUR1450.89. He paid using PayPal. 
They didnt work and on 21 February 2021, he raised a claim with PayPal. On 24 March 
2021, PayPal said theyd refund the amount if Mr C returned the goods to the seller. On 4 
April 2021, PayPal closed the case in favour of the seller.
Mr C complained that the cost of the return was going to be EUR350, and he didnt want to 
pay that  he said it was the sellers responsibility, not his.
PayPal said on 24 March 2021, theyd agreed that Mr C could be refunded with the amount 
of the purchase (EUR1450.89) if he returned the goods to the seller, but he would have to 
pay the costs of shipping. This was in their User Agreement. They offered a voucher for £75 
to help with the additional costs of shipping, but Mr C didnt accept this. And he didnt 
provide details of shipping, so they closed the case on 4 April 2021 without making the 
refund.
Mr C brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that PayPal acted in line with their 
User Agreement  which said that when an item is returned, the buyer must pay the shipping 
costs. She considered what had happened with the referral to Action Fraud  as PayPal had 
asked him to contact Action Fraud to get a report to say the heaters didnt work. She said 
that it was wrong of PayPal to say they were part of PayPal  but this didnt make a 
difference to the outcome anyway.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C filed a Significantly Not As Described claim with PayPal. Ive looked at PayPals User 
Agreement in connection with Mr Cs complaint. It says  that if they agree to the refund, 
then the goods must be shipped back to the seller, but the buyer must pay the shipping 
costs: When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a 
refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection entitles 
you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs 
you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for 
PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be 
able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information 
not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the 
decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify 
as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to 
reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
I can see that Mr C was advised by PayPal several times to return the goods to the seller 
and to provide the shipping details to them. This was put to Mr C in an email and Ive also 
listened to several calls between Mr C and PayPal between 16 March 2021 and 1 April 2021 
when they also told him that. And  if he had done so - PayPal had agreed to refund the 
amount of EUR1450.89. The emails said xxx has agreed to issue a full refund of 
EUR1450.89 once you return the item(s) associated with this transaction.to receive the 
refund, youll need to initiate the return shipment and upload the tracking information in the 
Resolution centre before 3 April 2021.the case will be closed automatically if you dont 
respond by 3 April 2021. But I can also see that Mr C didnt provide shipping details. So, 
PayPal closed the case on 4 April 2021.
Mr C spoke to PayPal. In the calls in March 2021, they asked him to provide details of the 
damage to the goods, or evidence that they didnt work. Mr C asked PayPal what they 
wanted  and was told they wanted to see evidence that the heaters didnt work. He didnt 
want to pay for a report to show this. PayPal referred him to Action Fraud to provide a free 
report  and wrongly said they were associated to PayPal. Mr C raised this as part of his 
complaint. But - I dont consider that this affected the outcome here. I havent seen that a 
report was produced. But in any case  the main point is that Mr C couldve got a refund if 
hed returned the goods to the seller  which he didnt.  
So  PayPal have acted in line with their terms and conditions. And they did say to Mr C a 
number of times that he needed to return the goods, and at his expense. So  I cant say 
that PayPal acted unfairly. They offered a voucher for £75 to Mr C  which he didnt accept. 
We asked PayPal if this offer still stands. PayPal told us that this was a gesture of goodwill, 
to help him with the shipping costs should he agree to ship the goods back to the seller. But 
because Mr C had refused to do this, the offer no longer stands.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2021.
