K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that Retail Money  Market  Ltd trading  as RateSetter unfairly charged him an 
early access  fee for withdrawing his investment early. 
background
RateSetter provides  a loan-based  crowdfunding facility through a peer to peer (P2P) 
platform in which investors can lend to borrowers  in return for interest.
In July 2017, RateSetter emailed all its investors to explain it had intervened over and above 
the usual course  of business with three of its borrowers due to bad debts. The email went on 
to explain that, because of this, it was giving all its investors the option to review their 
investments and to withdraw them without incurring any fees. The email  confirmed  that this 
offer would last for one month only.
Mr M had money invested in the loans affected  by the bad debts  but he said he didnt 
receive this email. He said he decided  to withdraw  his investment in October 2017 after 
reading an online article  about the financial issues surrounding these borrowers. But by this 
time the offer had expired and so he incurred a fee. Mr M complained  to RateSetter after 
seeing the fee-free sell out offer being  mentioned online. He felt he should be refunded the 
fee as he didnt have an opportunity to make  a fee-free withdrawal.
RateSetter explained all important information  about  loans is made  available  to investors on 
its website  including a notice board where  an article  on the offer was posted. RateSetter 
said it had seen Mr M had accessed his account  multiple times throughout the time the offer 
was running, so he would have had an opportunity  to read this information. RateSetter also 
explained it had included information  regarding the offer in his monthly statement which  it 
emailed to him in July. This email  had a link to the article  on its notice board. So as Mr M 
didnt contact it whilst the offer was available, RateSetter didnt think  it had done anything 
wrong. It did however  offer Mr M Â£150  as a gesture of goodwill. 
Mr M didnt  accept this. He was sure he hadnt  received the offer email and felt it was unfair  
to hide information about the offer at the bottom of his July statement email. So he brought 
the complaint  to our service. 
Our investigator looked into what happened and didnt think RateSetter  had done  anything 
wrong. She said she was persuaded RateSetter had sent Mr M the offer email  as it provided 
screenshots showing the email had been  delivered but unopened. She also didnt think  there 
was anything wrong in RateSetter including the offer information in his July statement email.  
Overall, she was satisfied that RateSetter had taken reasonable steps to make him aware of 
the offer through both the emails and on its notice board, and so she didnt recommend the 
fee be refunded.
Mr M remained unhappy as he said RateSetter should have contacted him by post if it had 
seen he hadnt  opened the email, especially considering he had a substantial amount 
invested. He also said the low take-up rate of the offer demonstrates  how RateSetter did the 
very minimum to notify him and other investors.
So as the investigator wasnt persuaded to change her mind,  the complaint has been passed  
to me to issue a decision.
Ref: DRN25152972my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusions as the investigator. Ill explain why.
In deciding this complaint  Ive considered whether  RateSetter did enough to make  Mr M 
aware of the offer and in turn, whether it was fair for him to incur a fee after the offer had 
expired. 
Did RateSetter do enough to make Mr M aware of the offer?
The Investor Key Information document which was provided to Mr M when he opened his 
account explained how RateSetter would  communicate with him:
We publish  loan performance data online, as well as information about  our Provision Fund  
and expected future performance.  Via the members site and monthly statements that all 
investors receive, we will also provide updates  on factors that may impact your investment  
return or risk.
So its clear to me that relevant  updates  would be provided on RateSetters site and in the 
monthly statements  Mr M received.
RateSetter explained it made  Mr M aware of the offer by way of two emails it sent him in July 
2017. The first of these  emails was titled,  An update on how RateSetter  has intervened with 
some borrowers and the option to review  your investment with a free sell-out. RateSetter 
hasnt provided  the exact email it said it sent Mr M but it has provided a copy of what was 
sent to all its investors. This explained that:
If you would like to sell out of your investment with RateSetter without incurring a fee, 
please email us.This  offer will last for one month,  from 18th July to 17th August 2017.
The second  email was his regular monthly  statement.  This email included  a section 
referencing the offer email RateSetter  had previously sent, as well a link to read more 
information on its notice  board.  Mr M acknowledges that he received this and kindly  provided 
our investigator with a copy, but he says he didnt receive the first email.
RateSetter has provided several  internal  screenshots  which show  that both emails were  sent 
to the same  email address. As Mr M received his July statement email  Im satisfied 
RateSetter had his correct email  address.  The screenshots also confirm both emails were  
received but only the July statement email was opened by Mr M. This leads me to believe its   
more likely than not that RateSetter sent the offer email to Mr M. Its unfortunate if Mr M 
didnt for some reason see the offer email  in July. But on the available  evidence that isnt 
something I can reasonably hold RateSetter  responsible for. 
I understand Mr M doesnt think RateSetter  should  have  included information about  the offer 
in his July statement email, but I dont agree. I think this was another  opportunity  for 
RateSetter to make  Mr M aware of the offer and in doing so it was trying to ensure he wasnt  
disadvantaged in any way. Ultimately, RateSetter  made it clear  it would  communicate  with 
him in this way and so I dont consider it to have acted unfairly  in this respect.
Ref: DRN25152973RateSetter has also provided internal screenshots which confirm Mr M accessed  his account 
numerous times whilst  the offer was available.  So I agree with our investigator that Mr M did 
have ample opportunity to read information  about the offer on RateSetters notice board. 
I appreciate Mr M thinks RateSetter should have done more  to contact him including  by post 
- especially  considering he had a substantial amount invested. However, taking into account 
all of the above, Im satisfied it did do enough to make him aware of the offer.  I also dont 
think the amount  hed invested had any bearing on the way it should have communicated  
with him.
Ive also noted  Mr Ms point regarding the low take up rate of the offer but Im not convinced 
this has any relevance  to his complaint. I say this as Ive only considered whether RateSetter 
did enough to make Mr M aware of the offer and not whether it did enough to let all its 
investors know. In any case, there may be a number of reasons why an investor may have 
decided not to withdraw their investment.
 
Should Mr M have incurred  a fee?
Mr M withdrew his investment in October  2017-  a few months after the offer had expired. 
RateSetters Investor Terms explain what happens when an investment is released early:  
6. The Sellout function
6.4. The amount  returned to you when you use the Sellout function in the 1, 3 and 5 year 
markets will equal the capital amount requested plus interest accrued to the date of the 
Sellout, minus the Return  Fee and any Assignment Fee. The amount will be estimated and 
displayed to you before  you commit to the Sellout.
RateSetter has confirmed  the investment was in the 1 Year market which incurs a fee. So as 
the terms are clear and the fee-free offer had expired  when Mr M withdrew,  I think  
RateSetter acted  fairly  in applying a fee in line with its terms and I find no reason for it to 
refund him this. 
On that basis, Im satisfied that RateSetter  has done nothing wrong. I recognise that a 
goodwill offer has been  made, so if RateSetter  is still willing  to make that offer then Ill leave 
it to Mr M to follow it up. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
