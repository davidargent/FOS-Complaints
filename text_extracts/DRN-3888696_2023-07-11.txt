The complaint
Mr L complains that Oplo PL Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
holiday club membership points. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being 
represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr L and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to buy some holiday club membership 
points in February 2019. The purchase price of the points was £16,875 and they traded in 
some existing holiday club membership points. Mr L entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with a finance provider for a loan of £16,875 and he agreed to make 179 monthly 
repayments of £172.26 and a final payment of £172.84 to the finance provider. 
Mr Ls representative made claims, on Mr Ls behalf, to the finance provider under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in January 2020. It said that: the points were 
mis-sold and misrepresented to Mr L and his wife; the contract between them and the 
holiday company was breached; commission was paid between the finance provider and the 
holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr L which created a breach of fiduciary duty 
and an unfair relationship; and the loan agreement was unaffordable. 
Mr Ls account with the finance provider was in arrears and I understand that he also 
complained to the finance provider about the high volume of calls that he was receiving. The 
finance provider didnt uphold that complaint because it said that it was trying to contact him 
to address the reason for the arrears on his account. But it didnt provide a substantive 
response to the claims made in Mr Ls representatives January 2020 letter. Mr Ls wife also 
made claims to the finance provider but those claims relate to a different loan account.
Mr L then complained to this service. His complaint form says that: the holiday company and 
the finance provider failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; 
the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him 
and the holiday company unduly pressured him and his wife into entering into the purchase 
agreement and him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A. I understand that Mr L entered into an individual voluntary 
arrangement in March 2022. The finance provider transferred Mr Ls loan account to Oplo in 
August 2022.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ls complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mr L and the finance provider was unfair and she 
wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
She also said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mr L. She didnt think that the finance provider had acted unreasonably in 
the number of calls that it had made to Mr L but she said that she would expect Oplo to work 
with Mr L with regards to his financial difficulties.
Mr Ls representative, on behalf of Mr L, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company 
and the unfair terms that it uses and it has raised its serious concerns about the way that the 
finance was sold to Mr L. It has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint 
relating to a fractional holiday ownership product in which it says the voluminous 
documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship was 
considered to be unfair. It says that the same voluminous documents and the same unfair 
charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr L and his wife so Mr Ls relationship with the 
finance provider is unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ls complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr L and his wife signed the purchase agreement in February 2019 and bought 
100,000 holiday club membership points from the holiday company and traded-in 
60,000 points in another holiday club;
they also signed other documents including a right of withdrawal form and the holiday 
companys declaration of treating customers fairly in a compliant sales practice and 
Mr L electronically signed the loan agreement;
Mr Ls representative made claims to the finance provider in January 2020 and Mr L 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter referred to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the points were misrepresented to Mr L and his 
wife, but his complaint form only referred to claims under section 140A and didnt 
refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ls claims under sections 75 and 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the January 2020 letter said that the holiday company represented to Mr L and his 
wife that the purchase would be an investment, but in the declaration that they signed 
they declared: We understand that we may sell our Points at any time for any 
price, providing our annual fees and finance (if applicable) is paid up to date and 
correct transfer of membership is completed as required. However, we also 
understand that we have not entered into this purchase purely for a wider investment 
opportunity or financial gain;
neither Mr L nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentation was made, the conversations 
that took place or the information that was provided to them and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company represented to Mr L 
and his wife that the points were an investment;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the points were 
misrepresented to Mr L and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the January 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has committed a 
repudiatory breach of contract because of the misrepresentation but Im not 
persuaded that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which 
Oplo would be liable under section 75;
Mr Ls representative says that commission was paid between the finance provider 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr L which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship but the finance provider says that there was 
no commission arrangement between it and the holiday company;
the loan agreement that was electronically signed by Mr L says: On or after the date 
when both you and we have signed this agreement, a commission payment may be 
made by us to one or more of the Credit Intermediaries named above; 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the finance provider paid a 
commission to the holiday company or to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
the finance provider to any of the credit intermediaries and the finance provider had 
disclosed to Mr L that it may pay a commission to any one or more of them;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that the finance provider 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation would have been sufficiently high to mean that 
the finance provider should have appreciated that not disclosing the amount of the 
commission to Mr L risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of any fiduciary duty in these 
circumstances;
Mr Ls representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr L and 
Mr Ls complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed 
to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan - but neither Mr L nor 
his representative had provided detailed evidence about Mr Ls financial position in 
February 2019 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him at that time;
our investigator said that Mr L and his representative had been asked to provide 
further information regarding Mr Ls financial circumstances at the time of sale but 
that no evidence had been received and she said that any further information would 
be reviewed  but Ive seen no further evidence about it other than the concerns that 
his representative has raised about the way that the loan was sold to Mr L; 
the finance provider says that upon receipt of Mr Ls loan application a full credit and 
affordability check was completed and, as he met its lending criteria, his application 
was conditionally accepted - but its not provided any further evidence about its credit 
and affordability check;
the finance provider has provided a statement for Mr Ls loan account dated in 
September 2020 which shows that the account went into arrears soon after the loan 
was made to Mr L and that no payments were made to the account from September 
2019  its account notes also show that Mr L said that his account was being dealt 
with by his solicitors timeshare termination team and then that his solicitors had told 
him not to discuss his account with the finance provider;I understand that Mr L entered into an individual voluntary arrangement in March 
2022 but Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show that 
the loan wasnt affordable for Mr L when it was made to him in February 2019 or that 
the loan was mis-sold to him;
I suggest that Mr L contacts Oplo, if he hasnt already done so, to explain to it his 
financial situation, including his individual voluntary arrangement  its required to 
respond to his financial difficulties positively and sympathetically; 
Mr Ls complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr L and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and Mr L into entering into the loan 
agreement  but Mr L and his wife signed the holiday companys declaration in 
February 2019 which said: We confirm that we have been given every opportunity to 
consider the purchase that we are making and we have not been put under pressure 
or coerced to purchase the products and services; and we also confirm that we have 
carefully considered other financial commitments and know that we are able to meet 
the financial obligations entered in to hereby; 
Mr L also responded to a question from the holiday company which asked whether 
he enjoyed the presentation and how he would describe the way that he was looked 
after and treated by saying: Yes. Lovely bloke. Not pushy;
Mr L and his wife had signed the holiday companys right of withdrawal form which 
said that they had the right to withdraw from the purchase agreement within 14 
calendar days without giving any reason, so if they were concerned about the way 
that the points had been sold to them and didnt want to buy them, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
the finance provider within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement and the loan agreement  but Ive seen no evidence to show that they did 
so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr L and his wife were 
unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement, that Mr L was unduly 
pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used 
unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Ls representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr L and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr L and his wife and 
the finance provider;
Mr Ls representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint 
relating to a fractional holiday ownership product in which it says the voluminous 
documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship was 
considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous documents and the same 
unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr L and his wife so Mr Ls 
relationship with the finance provider is unfair;that decision related to a fractional holiday ownership product which was sold as an 
investment and related to a specified property  Mr L and his wife bought a points 
based membership from the holiday company which didnt relate to a specified 
property and which I dont consider was sold to them as an investment;
both products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar contractual 
documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual documentation would 
be significantly different for a fractional product than for a points based membership;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ls relationship with 
the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr L and the finance provider 
in these circumstances;
the finance provider didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Ls claims so I cant 
say that its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it 
not to have upheld them;
Mr L had complained to the finance provider about the high volume of calls that he 
was receiving about the arrears on his loan account but it didnt uphold that complaint 
because it said that it was trying to contact him to address the reason for the arrears 
on his account  our investigator didnt think that the finance provider had acted 
unreasonably in the number of calls that it had made to Mr L;
neither Mr Ls representatives January 2020 letter nor Mr Ls complaint form 
included a complaint about the high volume of calls that Mr L was receiving so I dont 
consider that Mr L has made a complaint about that to this service so I make no 
finding on that issue; and
I sympathise with Mr L for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership points, the financial difficulties that hes experiencing and the health 
problems that hes suffering, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Oplo to refund to him any of the money that he's 
paid for the points, to cancel his loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2023.
