K821x#15complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about 16 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr C between  January 2018 
and October 2018.  There is a table at the end of this decision which shows some  of the 
information Sunny has provided about  the lending.
Mr C has said Sunny did not lend to him responsibly  and did not complete the appropriate  
affordability checks. Sunny has said it conducted eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability 
checks for each loan application.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators  assessment  but did make 
an offer to refund interest and charges for loan 16 only. Mr C rejected this offer and so the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN87743362I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 4 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Cs other  lending.  
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 5 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr C was having trouble in managing his money. Sunny ought to have realised that     
Mr C was paying for two other loans taken from Sunny  at the same  time as well as also 
having two outstanding short-term loans with other lenders. It was clear from this that Mr C 
wasnt using these high-cost loans to deal with a short-term cashflow problem.  So, in these 
circumstances, Sunny ought to have realised it was unlikely  Mr C wouldve been  able to 
sustainably repay  loan 5  and any subsequent  loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out six loans in five weeks  and was paying for three 
other loans with Sunny at the same time. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr C was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  16 taken 
out nine months  after Mr Cs first. Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
because:
Ref: DRN87743363these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 16 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on 5 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Cs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 16 should be removed from Mr 
Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2020.
