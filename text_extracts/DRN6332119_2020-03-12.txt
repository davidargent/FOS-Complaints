K820x#14complaint
Mr C and Ms R have  had three  separate  mortgage  accounts between them with 
The Mortgage Business Plc (TMB). Whilst Ms R is party to this complaint, the concerns 
raised are only Mr Cs and hes the one weve  been dealing with.
Mr C believes  TMB has made serious  mistakes  and/or committed fraud on his mortgage 
accounts, with the allegations being  widespread and our file running to over 5,000 pages of 
documents.
background
I issued a decision in December 2018 in which  I set out what  parts of this complaint we could 
and couldnt consider. Within that I said a more detailed timeline would be included  in my 
follow-up (that is, this) decision, and Ive done  that as an appendix at the end. The parties 
involved have already been  notified  of the descriptors  (M, T and AB) that Ive used in this 
decision so are aware which property address each relates to.
I previously said that we wont be considering the November 2007 issues relating to the titles 
of T and AB, nor will we be considering the 2012 court action  (or whether  TMB  was right to 
take action). Having considered everything again  I see no reason  to depart from that stance, 
and so this decision  wont deal with those issues (albeit it will have to refer to them for 
context purposes).
To summarise the information, by property, from my detailed timeline appendix:  
The mortgage debt taken out on property  M (which has title number #984)
Is account number  *6294-9 (renumbered to *62940700 in March  2013), and is held in 
the joint names of Mr C and Ms R.
Was taken out in April 2000  apparently on the standard  variable rate (SVR). It was 
moved to product  code TBE024 on 17 January 2004, and to code TBE520 on 
1 August 2006. It reverted to the SVR on 1 September 2011  when the second  
preferential product rate term ended. 
Was originally a repayment mortgage, and was changed to interest-only in 2008.
The original loan was £71,400 and there have been the following drawdowns:
o4 Oct 04 £17,300
o24 May 05   £1,600
o16 June 05   £1,600
o20 June 05 £13,400 
o19 June 06   £5,000
o26 June 06 £15,000
o13 June 08   £6,000
The mortgage debt taken out on property  T (which has title number #060)
Is account number  *7774-8 (renumbered *77740600 in March 2013), and is held in 
Mr Cs sole name.
Ref: DRN63321192It was taken out in October 2014  on product code TBE129 and was changed to 
TBE436 from 1 July 2006 under the terms of allowing the new mortgage to be 
granted to build property AB.
Has always been held on an interest-only  basis.
The original loan was £127,500 and there  have been no drawdowns.
The mortgage debt taken out on property  AB (which has title number #413)
Is account number  *9043-3, and was held in joint names.
Was taken out in July 2006 on product code TBE413 upon which it stayed until it was 
repaid (by remortgaging to a new lender Ill call W) in November 2007. 
Was always held on an interest-only  basis.
The original loan was £80,000 and the following drawdowns were  taken:
o23 Jan 07 £20,000
o24 Jan 07 £10,000
o17 Apr 07 £15,000
Our adjudicator rejected  the complaint saying, in summary, he couldnt find anything  to 
substantiate any of Mr Cs allegations. As Mr C didnt agree Im now making this decision as 
the final stage  of our process. Irrespective of whether or not Mr C accepts this final decision, 
well not be entering  into any further  correspondence about these matters, and any future  
contact will simply  be added to our file and not responded to (other than to process his and 
Ms Rs acceptance or rejection of this decision).
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I said at the start, Mr C has made  widespread and serious allegations about the conduct 
of TMB  and/or its solicitors. Im pleased to say these are all entirely unfounded  and almost 
all of the issues Mr C has raised  are due to him misunderstanding the terminology used and 
misunderstanding internal documents. Mr C made subject access requests of TMB and as 
part of that he received  a lot of internal screen prints and notes which make sense to the 
people who needed  to understand them at the time (TMB staff)  but are clearly confusing to a 
lay person (such as Mr C).
Theres no doubt that a conveyancer made a serious mistake in 2007  but that conveyancer 
was acting on behalf of Mr C and/or his new mortgage lender W. The conveyancer  (and the 
mistakes it made)  had nothing to do with TMB.
In 2007 TMB  was told that Mr C and Ms R were  remortgaging property AB (which had 
account number  *9043-3 and title number  #413).  By remortgage we mean  they were taking 
out a mortgage with a new lender (W) which would be secured on property  AB. The new 
mortgage funds  would  be used to repay the existing mortgage with TMB that was secured 
on AB.
Ref: DRN63321193As far as both lenders  were concerned everything went through  correctly, with the new 
lender releasing  the funds and the conveyancer sending  the money to TMB to pay off the 
mortgage account *9043-3 which was secured on property AB. But unfortunately the 
conveyancer made a mistake in the next stage  as they put the wrong title number (#060 
instead of #413) on the paperwork for the Land Registry.
This meant that the loan with TMB (*9043-3) secured on AB (#413) was repaid, but the 
property was left charged to TMB at the Land Registry.  And whilst the loan (*7774-8) 
secured on T (#060)  was left untouched with TMB, the property was now charged to W. So 
the actual debts were  correct, the only problem was the properties  were charged incorrectly 
with the Land Registry  (and Ms R had been  added as a co-owner  of property T, again  in 
error by the conveyancer).
I understand how confusing this is to someone that doesnt work within the industry, but I 
can only seek to reassure  Mr C that TMB made absolutely no mistakes here, and the easiest 
way to now resolve it is as TMBs  solicitors have put forward;  that paperwork is completed  by 
Mr C and Ms R to transfer property Ts ownership  back into Mr Cs sole name  and to put a 
new charge on in favour of TMB (as security for the mortgage loan account *7774-8  that 
Mr C took out to buy T and still owes). That would put things back in the position they would 
have been in had the conveyancer not made the mistake in 2007.
I understand there have been substantial  legal fees since  then, but some of those are due to 
arrears on the T mortgage (*7774-8) which led to legal action being taken. The rest are 
because the matter has become so protracted  - with a lot of correspondence between  Mr C, 
TMB and its solicitors - when a simple solution  has been put forward. I strongly  recommend  
Mr C and Ms R seek the independent  legal advice mentioned by TMBs solicitors in 
December 2017  (if theyve not already done so) and seriously consider the options put 
forward. If Mr C and Ms R dont  agree  to the work being undertaken, then TMB can take the 
matter to court to force an outcome,  and the costs for that will be added to the relevant  
mortgage account(s).
The mortgage accounts arent  linked  as Mr C seems to think. Amounts and products cant  
just swap around between them. They are two (and were three when the mortgage on AB 
was held with TMB)  completely separate mortgage accounts. Its not possible for amounts 
and products to move  between them as Mr C believes. The common links are Mr C and 
TMB, but thats it. Theyre as separate as if one account was held by Mr C and the other was 
held by a stranger hed never met. The accounts simply cant be mixed in the way he thinks.
Im satisfied TMB made no mistakes in 2007,  and Ive considered the other allegations of 
wrongdoing that Mr C has put forward. I wont be answering all of them,  as they are plentiful 
and all without merit. Having read through it all, many of Mr Cs allegations  directly  contradict 
others he put forward, and others he admits to being  mistaken  about at a later date.  And as I 
said earlier, much  of it seems to be a misunderstanding of the internal documents and 
terminology used.
On 28 July 2018 Mr C sent an email  to our adjudicator which said I received a copy  of your 
opinion letter from [TMBs solicitor].  This is the first time I have seen it. I certainly  dont agree 
with your opinion. But the opinion letter had been  sent to Mr C on 23 April 2018  and we 
know he received  and read it at the time as he responded to it making reference to 
something our adjudicator  had said within the letter.
Ref: DRN63321194In Mr Cs recent submission hes said This is my bank statement the [T] 774-8 is £644.95 
[M] 294-9 is £630.  88. My balance on [M] is £87,491.81 but my payment  is nearly  the same 
as [T] 774-8 a loan of £127,500 but with a balance difference  of nearly £39,500  both are the 
same percentage rate.  The bank statement sent in relates to payments made in 
November/December 2004.
But in November 2004 the mortgage on T was held on an interest-only basis and the 
mortgage on M was still repayment. On top of that the rates werent  the same as T was 
charged at Bank of England  Base  Rate (BBR)+1.35% and M was BBR+0.99%,  so the two 
mortgage accounts cant be compared in the way Mr C has done.  Having run the mortgage 
details through  a mortgage calculator they give broadly  the same figures as those  shown on 
Mr Cs bank statement. 
Mr C has said Can you explain to me why this loan has my [T] account, the TMB have 
signed for it on the 27/7/04 and I actually signed  for it on the 8/8/04. I didnt buy [T] until 
15/10/2004. This loan was taken out on [T] nearly 3 months before I bought the property. It is 
very clear you have the wrong roll number  on this loan. The document Mr C is referring to is 
the credit  agreement for his purchase  of T.
To explain, a customer applies  to a lender for a mortgage (either  directly or through a 
broker). The lender then assesses the application  and if its willing to grant the mortgage  it 
issues a mortgage  offer (and in this case it also issued a separate credit agreement  for the 
flexible features). That mortgage offer will always be issued before the property is bought  (in 
this case in July 2004 for a purchase  that completed  on 15 October  2004) as it sets out the 
terms of the mortgage  contract the lender is willing to enter  into. If the customer  accepts the 
offer (as Mr C did here on 8 August 2004) then the contract is agreed,  and gets put into force 
when the funds are released (in October 2004 here) for completion. The loan wasnt taken 
out in July or August  as Mr C thinks,  that was just when the paperwork was issued for it. The 
loan was taken  out (on the terms set out in that paperwork) in October 2004 when Mr C 
bought T to fund the purchase  of it.
Mr C has also said about that transaction If you look at the loan it clearly  states  I dont need  
deeds as I already have executed deeds.  He points to this as evidence that the loan 
intended to be taken out to purchase T was instead  secured  against  M in error, as he didnt 
already have executed deeds for T at that time, but did have them for M. But Mr C has 
misread and misunderstood what the agreement says. The actual wording is You agree that 
the mortgage deed will secure your obligations to us under this Flexible Options Agreement. 
The security  will be over the property at [T]. Where you have already executed a Mortgage  
Deed in our favour which is acceptable  to us, you will not be required to execute  a further 
Mortgage Deed. (the bold type is my emphasis).
The key word in that is where, ie where theres  an already executed Deed another  isnt 
needed, but where there isnt one then one will be needed. The reason its worded that way 
is because TMB used the same paperwork for new Flexible Options Agreements  as it did for 
amendments to existing  agreements. Here  it was a new agreement (to fund the purchase of 
T) so a Deed was needed,  but if it was an amendment to an existing agreement  (as were 
issued to Mr C and Ms R at various  times  for their other accounts when they increased their 
credit limits) then a new Deed wasnt needed.
Again, for that same agreement I received my mortgage offer for [T] I signed  for this 
mortgage with the [B family, Mr C and Ms Rs neighbours at M] as witnesses.  But thats not 
Ref: DRN63321195correct. The 2004  credit agreement to buy T (*7774-8)  was witnessed by Ms R. The B family 
witnessed the credit agreement  in June 2006  which was for the mortgage on AB (*9043-3)
Mr C has said My mad theory  might  just not be a [sic] mad as I think. In 2009  my payments  
on [T] dropped.  To just over £118  a month  now that would have been  impossible on a 
repayment at standard variable. But in 2009 T (*7774-8) was held on an interest-only  basis  
(not repayment) and was on a tracker  rate (not standard  variable). At that time the BBR 
dropped significantly  to 1.5% in January 2009,  1% in February and to 0.5% in March  2009. 
So as Mr Cs product  on T (*7774-8) was BBR+0.49% that gave an equivalent pay rate of 
1.99% in January 2009, dropping to 0.99% in the March, so much lower than the SVR.
[Ms R] never downloaded money  on the new build 3-3 I sorted out the money. I just saw the 
24th and 23rd January these are the loans  that were for my cellar  in [M]. I told her at the time I 
have downloaded £10,000 today she said thats  funny  I downloaded  £20,000 yesterday. I 
said it doesnt matter  we will use it anyway.  Again, this isnt entirely correct. The 
transactions Mr C is referring to took place on 23/24  January 2007 and were drawdowns 
from the AB mortgage  (*9043-3)  so hes right about that. But where hes wrong is that this 
wasnt two transactions  carried out one each by Mr C and Ms R, instead it was one request 
of £30,000 that had to be split as the maximum amount that could be sent by electronic 
transfer was £20,000 so the remaining £10,000 was sent by cheque. So that conversation 
couldnt have  happened about  those transactions as one party (or both acting together) 
made a single request for £30,000.
[TMBs solicitor] did say the [T 7774-8] mortgage was redeemed  in November 2007. The 
letter Mr C is referring to is from TMBs solicitor to him in which its trying to explain what  had 
happened. The letter  says Whilst it is correct  that this is the mortgage which was discharged 
in error  in November  2007 so this is a misunderstanding by Mr C of the terminology the 
solicitor is using. When the solicitor talks of the mortgage  which was discharged  theyre  
using mortgage  in the correct legal sense of the word (ie the Mortgage Deed) so are 
referring to the fact that whilst the debt on T wasnt repaid (*7774-8), the charge secured on 
the property was discharged (#060). 
To explain; the word mortgage is commonly used  to mean the debt thats outstanding on the 
property (in this case, for example, it was £126,332 that was the debt on AB with TMB at the 
time it was repaid), but thats really shorthand for mortgage loan account. The word really 
means the Mortgage Deed, and thats the promise to repay the funds by putting forward  
something as security (ie a property) for it. 
In this case the mortgage loan account  for AB *9043-3 should  have been repaid/redeemed  
and the Mortgage (Deed) on property AB #413  should have been discharged.  But instead 
the mortgage loan account for AB *9043-3 was repaid/redeemed (correctly) but the 
Mortgage (Deed) on property T #060  was discharged (in error).
As I said,  I wont  be answering all of Mr Cs allegations as the file runs to over 5,000  pages 
and the claims are widespread, contradict each other and have no merit if the detailed  
timeline Ive attached to this decision is worked through. The section above answers just 
some of the points to show that these are due to misunderstandings on Mr Cs part. I 
understand these  are complex matters and I also understand they are confusing to try to 
work out. All I can do here  and what I hope Ive done  is reassure Mr C and Ms R that 
there arent the errors  on the accounts that Mr C thinks  there  are. The only error I can see 
was by the unrelated conveyancer (so not TMBs responsibility) in 2007 and TMBs solicitor 
has put forward a pragmatic solution  for that.
Ref: DRN63321196Its not possible for us to carry  out a forensic  audit of the accounts  histories.  Its open  to 
Mr C and Ms R to ask a suitably qualified  independent accountant to do that for them. That 
would have to be at their expense, though if an error  were  found to their detriment  they could 
include the costs  of finding it in any complaint  that followed. 
Having considered everything  Im satisfied TMB  is administering  Mr C and Ms Rs 
mortgages correctly.  For that reason Im satisfied it hasnt done anything  wrong  here. I would 
ask that, unless they obtain a forensic audit of the account as Ive explained above, that they 
look forward rather than trying to seek unnecessary explanations into non-existent problems  
on what are complex mortgage  accounts.  
my final decision
I dont uphold any part of this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Ms R to accept or reject my decision before 
12 April 2020.

Ref: DRN63321197APPENDIX TO DECISION  DETAILED  MORTGAGE TIMELINE
Both sides have already  been notified  of the descriptors (M, T and AB) that Ive used in this 
timeline so are aware which  property address each relates to.
7 Apr 00 TMB issued a mortgage  offer in the joint names  of Mr C and Ms R. The 
mortgage was for them to buy the residential property M. It was assigned  
mortgage account number ending *94/1.
The purchase price was £84,000  and they wanted to borrow £71,400 over 
25 years  on a repayment basis. 
It was a flexible  mortgage  that allowed for drawdowns up to an agreed  credit 
limit; at that time the credit limit was set at £71,400. 
Its not clear from the mortgage offer Ive seen whether there was a 
preferential interest rate, so Im assuming this mortgage was taken out on the 
standard variable  rate (SVR). 
13 Apr 00  Mr C and Ms R signed  to accept the mortgage offer of 7 April 2000.
20 Apr 00 The mortgage to buy M completed, so Mr C and Ms R became the owners of 
the property. The mortgage  completed under  account  number ending *94/1 
and the title number for property M at the Land Registry ended  #984. As this 
was an entirely  new mortgage  account,  Mr C and Ms R executed a Mortgage 
Deed in TMBs favour.
18 Jan 03 Mr C and Ms R signed  an agreement to increase the credit limit on the M 
mortgage account (*94/1) to £91,400.  As this was an amendment to an 
existing mortgage account  a new Mortgage  Deed didnt need  to be executed.
17 Jan 04 Mr C and Ms R took a preferential rate product on the M mortgage account 
(*94/1). The new rate was code TBE024  and was Bank of England Base  Rate  
(BBR) +0.99% until 31 July 2006. When the new rate started, the account 
number was amended  to a new format  and ended  *6294-9.
30 June 04 A mortgage broker submitted an application for a buy-to-let (BTL) mortgage in 
Mr Cs sole name  to purchase  property T. It was assigned the mortgage 
account number ending *7774-8.
20 July 04 A mortgage offer was produced for the application to purchase T. 
The purchase price was £149,950 and with a £127,500  mortgage  over 
25 years  on an interest-only basis. 
It was a flexible  mortgage  that allowed for drawdowns up to an agreed  limit; at 
that time the credit limit was set at £127,550. 
The mortgage was applied for on product code TBE129  which was 
BBR+1.35% for the life of the mortgage.
Ref: DRN633211988 Aug 04 Mr C signed to accept  the mortgage offer for the purchase of T under 
mortgage account number *7774-8, and Ms R witnessed his signature.
29 Sept 04 Mr C and Ms R wrote  to TMB quoting  their account number for M (*6294-9). 
They said they wanted to draw down  the available credit of £17,300  into 
Mr Cs bank account with Abbey National.  
That drawdown took place on 7 October 2004  and increased their mortgage 
debt on M (*6294-9) at that time from about £71,300  to about £88,600. 
This sum was used  towards the deposit  for the purchase of T (ie the 
difference between  the purchase price  of £149,950 and the mortgage  under 
account number  *7774-8 being raised  on T of £127,550) with the rest of the 
deposit coming from savings Mr C and Ms R already  held.
15 Oct 04 The mortgage to buy T completed, so Mr C became the owner  of the 
property. The mortgage account number ended  *7774-8  and the title number 
of property  T at the Land  Registry ended #060 . As this was an entirely new 
mortgage account, Mr C executed  a Mortgage  Deed in TMBs  favour.
So at this point  there  was:
a residential repayment mortgage (*6294-9) of about £88,600 in joint names secured 
on property M (#984), and 
a BTL interest-only mortgage  (*7774-8) of £127,500 in Mr Cs sole name secured on 
property T (#060).
4 May 05 Mr C and Ms R asked  to increase the credit  limit on M (*6294-9) by £15,000 
to £106,400 so they could draw down extra  funds  for home improvements.
24 May 05 £1,600  was requested to be taken as a drawdown from M (*6294-9) and be 
sent to Mr Cs bank  account with Abbey  National.  As the increase in credit 
limit hadnt gone through,  this was the maximum amount available  to be 
drawn down at that time.
7 June 05 Mr C and Ms R signed  the declaration for the increase in credit  limit on M 
(*6294-9).
15 June 05 Confirmation of the increase in credit limit on M (*6294-9) to £106,400  was 
sent to Mr C and Ms R. A further  £1,600 was released to the Abbey National 
account that day (in error as it should  have  been £15,000).
16 June 05 Ms R phoned to complain theyd  only received £1,600 and they needed  the 
rest urgently.  
20 June 05 The remaining £13,400  available under the credit limit on M (*6294-9) was 
drawn down.
Ref: DRN6332119918 Jan 06 An application  was put in by a mortgage broker for a self-build BTL mortgage. 
This was to build property AB on land that fell within  the title for property T 
(#060). This application was assigned the account  number  ending *4190-2 
and didnt  proceed (it was declined)  as it was noted that the title needed to be 
split first.
3 Feb 06 Mr Cs solicitor contacted TMB to ask for its consent  to transfer part of the 
land under Ts title (#060) to a new deed so the new property AB could be 
built. It was agreed that Mr C would reduce  the mortgage debt on T (*7774-8) 
by £1,725 to do so.
9 Mar 06 Mr C paid £1,725 off the mortgage  debt on T (*7774-8) to reduce the balance 
so the title could be split.
4 Apr 06 A Land Registry TP1 form was signed to remove land from title number 
ending #060 (property  T), and to note the ownership of the new land under 
the new title would be held jointly by Mr C and Ms R.
7 Apr 06 The title split was completed and the land where AB was to be built now had 
its own title number ending  #413 . Property T retained its title number  of #060.
19 Apr 06 The mortgage broker resubmitted  the application for the self-build BTL 
mortgage for property  AB. The mortgage  was applied for in Mr Cs sole name. 
This time the account number  allocated ended  *9043-3. 
The mortgage was to build property AB, and the mortgage requested  was for 
£80,000 over 15 years  on an interest-only basis.  
It was a flexible  mortgage  that allowed for drawdowns up to an agreed  limit; at 
that time the credit limit was set at £80,000.  
26 Apr 06 TMBs internal note says *9043-3 had been  declined (TMB has confirmed this 
was a typographical error and it should have said *4190-2  had been declined, 
as *9043-3  was the account number given to the resubmitted application that 
completed).
12 May 06 The mortgage broker provided  TMB with Ms Rs details  and asked that the 
application for AB (*9043-3)  be amended to a joint application because Ms R 
was a joint owner of the land due to the way Mr C and Ms R had completed 
the TP1 form on 4 April 2006.
30 May 06 Mr C and Ms R requested a credit  limit increase  of £20,000 on M (*6294-9), 
this time it was recorded that £10,000  was to be for debt consolidation and 
£10,000 for basement improvements.
4 June 06 Mr C and Ms R signed  a declaration for the increased  credit limit for M 
(*6294-9). 
5 June 06 TMB told Mr C that the mortgage  product had to be changed on T (*7774-8) 
to a multi-BTL product before  the mortgage on AB (*9043-3) could complete.
Ref: DRN6332119107 June 06 TMB wrote  to Mr C and Ms R about M (*6294-9) to say only £19,700 was 
available to be drawn down.
15 June 06 Mr C and Ms R signed  the flexible  options  credit  agreement for AB (*9043-3), 
which was witnessed by a couple of their neighbours (Mr and Mrs B).
19 June 06 A drawdown of £5,000 was made from the M mortgage account  (*6294-9).
26 June 06 A drawdown of £15,000  was made from the M mortgage account  (*6294-9).
28 June 06 A product  transfer offer for T (*7774-8)  was produced. This was to transfer it 
to the multi-BTL product required so the (*9043-3) mortgage could be taken 
out on AB.
The offer showed an outstanding balance on T (*7774-8) of £128,089 on an 
interest-only basis, with the new product code to be TBE436 which was 
BBR+0.49% until 30 June 2011, and SVR thereafter.
29 June 06 The mortgage offer for AB (*9043-3) was produced in the joint names  of Mr C 
and Ms R on product TBE413  which was BBR+0.79% until 31 May 2008, and 
BBR+1.79% thereafter.
3 July 06 A product  transfer offer was produced for M (*6294-9)  to move it to TBE520 
which was BBR+0.49% until 31 August  2011 and SVR thereafter. At this time 
the credit limit was £126,450  and the outstanding mortgage debt was around 
£123,500. This offer was produced  because  the existing preferential rate 
(TBE024) on M was coming to an end on 31 July 2006.
13 July 06 The mortgage on AB (*9043-3) completed and the £80,000  mortgage  funds 
(less notified deductions) were released to Mr C and Ms Rs nominated 
solicitor. The mortgage account  number  for AB ended *9043-3  and the title 
number at the Land Registry ended #413.
15 July 06 A £79,000 cheque was paid into Mr Cs Abbey National bank account.
1 Aug 06 Mr C and Ms Rs mortgage  on M (*6294-9) was moved to product code 
TBE520 as their previous preferential rate ended on 31 July 2006.
So at this point  there  was:
a residential repayment mortgage (*6294-9) of about £123,500 in joint names 
secured on property M (#984),
 a BTL interest-only mortgage  (*7774-8) of about £128,000 in Mr Cs sole name  
secured on property T (#060), and 
a self-build mortgage (*9043-3) of about £80,000 in joint names secured on property 
AB (#413).
12 Jan 07 Mr C and Ms R signed  a declaration for an increased credit  limit for AB 
(*9043-3).
Ref: DRN63321191123 Jan 07 Mr C and Ms R requested a £30,000 drawdown on AB (*9043-3). Only 
£20,000 could  be done  by electronic transfer (to Mr Cs Abbey  National bank  
account) so the remaining £10,000 was sent by cheque the following day.
4 Apr 07 TMB wrote  to Mr C and Ms R following a request for a further increased credit 
limit on AB (*9043-3) asking  them to sign a declaration  and provide details of 
the works they wanted to carry  out. Mr C and Ms R signed  the declaration on 
9 April 2007.
April 07 Mr C and Ms R replied  to TMB listing the works as connecting (and finishing) 
the electrics, gas and water, a kitchen, carpets,  decking, building  supplies and 
putting in drop kerbs  and the driveway. The costs were listed as just over 
£15,600.
13 Apr 07 The credit  limit for AB (*9043-3)  was increased to £125,093, which gave 
£15,181 available to be drawn down.
17 Apr 07 Mr C and Ms R requested a £15,000 drawdown on AB (*9043-3).
1 Sept 07 Mr C missed his monthly payment due on T (*7774-8),  initiating an arrears 
situation that worsened over the following  years.
18 Oct 07 Another lender that Ill call W issued a mortgage offer to remortgage  property  
AB to it.
14 Nov 07 The remortgage completed but unfortunately  the conveyancer made some 
serious mistakes. Whilst the TMB mortgage on AB (*9043-3) was paid off 
(£126,332.21), the conveyancer  muddled up the title number of AB (#413) 
with that for T (#060) and so registered the new W charge  against  T instead 
of AB. The conveyancer also added Ms R to the title for T. 
So, this meant:
M was unaffected,  with a joint TMB  mortgage  account (*6294-9) and joint title at the 
Land Registry (#984).
T had a TMB mortgage account  in Mr Cs sole name (*7774-8) but was charged to W 
with joint title (with Ms R) at the Land  Registry (#060).
AB had a joint mortgage account  with W but was still charged to TMB in joint names at 
the Land Registry  (#413).
2 May 08 Ms R asks to change the mortgage account on M (*6294-9) from repayment 
to interest-only.
20 May 08 Mr C and Ms R sign a declaration  to transfer the M mortgage  account 
(*6294-9) to interest-only.
1 June 08 The switch to interest-only  for the M mortgage account (*6294-9) takes place.
13 June 08 A £6,000  drawdown is made  from the M mortgage  account (*6294-9).
Ref: DRN633211912So at this point  there  was:
a residential interest-only mortgage (*6294-9) in joint names secured on property M 
(#984), and 
a BTL interest-only mortgage  (*7774-8) in Mr Cs sole name which  should have been  
(and previously had been) secured on property T (#060) but was now secured on 
property AB (#413).
2010 It came to light that the charges had been mixed up by the conveyancer  in 
2007. TMB has said its solicitor discovered the problem  when it was dealing 
with arrears on Mr Cs *7774-8 mortgage  account, whereas Mr C says his 
solicitor found  it when dealing with some  legal  work  that came  about due to 
his split from Ms R. 
It doesnt matter here how or why it came  to light so Ive not looked into this 
point any further,  suffice  to say the parties became aware of the problem.
18 Nov 10 To protect  TMBs interests  its solicitor  registered a Unilateral Notice on the 
title of T (#060) in respect  of the original  legal  charge of 15 October 2004, and 
lender W arranged for its solicitor to do a similar  Unilateral Notice on the title 
of AB (#413).
1 July 11 Mr Cs preferential interest rate on T (*7774-8) ended,  and the mortgage 
account moved onto the SVR upon which it has remained.
1 Sept 11 Mr C and Ms Rs preferential rate on M (*9294-9) ended,  and the mortgage 
account moved to the SVR upon  which it has remained.
3 Apr 12 At a repossession court hearing due to the arrears on T (*7774-8) the judge  
was satisfied  with TMBs  explanation of the events of 2007, and awarded a 
Possession Order on AB. This was possible because TMB still had an all 
monies charge over AB (#413) because of the conveyancing mix-up in 2007. 
So it could use that to deal with the arrears  on the T mortgage  account 
(*7774-8). As AB was jointly owned at the Land Registry, this brought Ms R 
into the equation despite the fact the mortgage  debt on T was held in Mr Cs 
sole name.
As the payments to T (*7774-8) recommenced  the Possession Order  over AB 
(#413) wasnt enforced.
March 13 The account numbers  were changed due to a new computer system. T 
moved from *7774-8  to ending *77740600 and M moved from *6294-9 to 
*62940700.
22 May 13 TMB wrote  to Mr C about  the mortgage account  for T (*77740600) to confirm 
the arrears of just under £7,500 had been  consolidated, which  moved the 
balance up to just over £145,000.
Ref: DRN6332119139 Sept 15 Deeds of Substituted Security were executed by Mr C and Ms R, TMB and W. 
These Deeds swapped over the charges, taking them back  to how they 
should have been  with T (#060) charged to TMB, and AB (#413) charged to 
W. The Land  Registry didnt  allow for the previous charges to be simply 
reinstated, which is why the Deeds of Substituted Security were required. The 
Deeds, in effect, swapped over the securities so they were  back on the right 
properties.
4 Apr 17 TMBs solicitor wrote to Mr C to notify  him that a Deed of Variation needed to 
be completed as the Deed  of Substituted Security contained an error. The 
solicitor said the document states 
Original Security Document: Mortgage  Deed dated  15 October 2004 and 
made between the Lender [being  our client] and [Mr C].
Whilst it is correct  that this is the mortgage  which was discharged in error  in 
November 2007,  in order for the Deed to take effect,  the Original Security 
Document is required  to be referred  to as the mortgage dated  13 July 2006 
made between our client, you and [Ms R], this being the legal  charge  which 
was swapped over from [property AB] on 9 September  2015.
The solicitor  explained  it could be corrected by completing a Deed of 
Variation, and until that was done a further Unilateral Notice  had been  
registered against T (#060) to protect  TMBs  position. The letter  also noted 
the balance due on M (*62940700) on 15 February 2017 was £124,044.44 
(excluding any legal and other costs),  and on T (*77740600) on 17 February  
2017 was £169,521.56 (again excluding any legal  and other costs).
7 Nov 17 TMBs solicitor sent an email to Mr C saying  the simplest  way for matters  to 
be resolved was for Mr C and Ms R to execute a fresh  legal charge (with 
Ms R entering into the charge  as a third party). It confirmed Ms R had agreed  
with that to draw matters  to a close, and said once  the charge  was executed 
and registered then all the Unilateral Notices could be removed. It went on to 
say this way further costs  would be prevented, however if Mr C didnt agree 
then an application would be made  through the courts which would  incur  legal 
costs.
19 Dec 17 TMBs solicitor told Mr C and Ms R that to remove Ms R from the deeds of T 
(#060) Mr C and Ms R would need  to complete a transfer of property 
application, which  would mean  theyd need to execute a fresh Mortgage Deed 
in favour  of TMB  as security for the  monies previously advanced under the 
account *77740600. 
The solicitor  sent a blank Deed document  to show them the paperwork.  TMB  
said it would  fund both Mr C and Ms R getting independent  legal advice up to 
£350+VAT each.  The solicitor said once thatd been done the Deed could be 
executed which would  move T (#060) back to TMB and into Mr Cs sole name 
at the Land Registry. The solicitor said it would then remove  the Unilateral 
Notices and Deed of Substituted Security on behalf of TMB that had been 
registered against AB (#413). The solicitor  said that if Mr C and Ms R didnt 
agree to this, then TMB would make  an application to court for an order  
directing the same.
