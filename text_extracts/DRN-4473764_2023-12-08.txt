The complaint
Mrs L complains about how Bank of Scotland plc (Halifax) dealt with a payment dispute 
(dispute) she raised with it.
What happened
On 13 March 2023 Mrs Ls current account (account) was debited with £138.37 in favour of 
a third party I will call V.
On 6 April Mrs Ls account was debited with £1,043.15 in favour of a third party that I will 
call E ($1,747.00 @ 1.67474) and £31.69 in fees.
On 24 April Mrs Ls account was debited with £1,043.83 in favour of E ($1,747.00 @ 
1.67364) and £31.71 in fees.
Following the 24 April debit to her account Mrs L contacted Halifax to dispute it.
On 27 April Halifax credited Mrs Ls account with £1,043.83 and £31.71 whilst it investigated 
her dispute.
On 12 May Halifax sent Mrs L an email asking for further information about her dispute. 
Mrs L says this email was never received by her.
On 6 June and having received no response to its email dated 12 May Halifax debited 
Mrs Ls account with £1,043.83. Halifax didnt debit Mrs Ls account with £31.71 in fees.
On 27 June Mrs L asked Halifax for her dispute to be investigated again.
On 3 July E refunded to Mrs Ls account £1,040.43 ($1,747.00 @ 1.67911).
On 25 July, and after Mrs L had raised a compliant, Halifax issued her with a final response 
letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL Halifax said it was prepared to pay Mrs L £35.00 in 
resolution of her complaint.
On 3 August Mrs L contacted Halifax to say that she wasnt satisfied with its offer of £35.00 
in resolution of her complaint. However, Halifax said it wasnt prepared to offer/pay her 
anything further and as outlined in its FRL the next step was for Mrs L to refer her complaint 
to our service for investigation.
On 17 September Mrs L referred her complaint to our service.
Mrs Ls complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
having offered/paid Mrs L £35.00 Halifax need do nothing further.
Mrs L disagreed with the investigators view so her complaint has been passed to me for 
review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than it may merit. 
No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues 
here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as 
a free alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive 
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be 
able to reach what I think is the right outcome. I will, however, refer to those crucial aspects 
which impact my decision.
Secondly, I would add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. And although I need to 
have regard to the law Im not bound by it, and I can come to a different outcome to what a 
court might come to.
Mrs L says that Halifax should never have paid E the sum of $1,747.00 on 24 April, or it 
should have at least contacted her for authority to pay it before doing so. 
Now I appreciate Mrs L feels very strongly about this particular point but Im satisfied that 
Halifax paid the sum that it did to E on 24 April in good faith and in the belief Mrs L had 
authorised the payment of it. 
I will now turn to how Halifax dealt with Mrs Ls dispute when, and after, she raised it.
First I would like to point out that regardless of whether Mrs L believed Es request on 
24 April for payment of $1,747.00 was fraudulent (rather than a simple mistake or oversight) 
and regardless of her view on how her dispute should have been recorded and treated by 
Halifax, Im satisfied that Halifax treated her dispute seriously and appropriately. I would also 
add that its immaterial how Halifax recorded Mrs Ls dispute in its records and what it might 
have done about it had E not made the refund that it did on 3 July.
Mrs L raised her dispute with Halifax on, or shortly after, 24 April. On 27 April Halifax issued 
Mrs L with a temporary refund and then, on 12 May, sent her an email asking for further 
information. I appreciate Mrs L might not agree, but Im not persuaded that Halifax did 
anything wrong here. I would also add, for the sake of completeness, that although I dont 
dispute that Mrs L never received Halifaxs email dated 12 May Im satisfied, on the balance 
of probabilities, that this was sent by Halifax and sent to an email provided by Mrs L for such 
messages to be sent to.
On 6 June and having received no response to its email dated 12 May Halifax debited 
Mrs Ls account with £1,043.83. I think this was an entirely fair and reasonable thing for it to 
do.On 27 June Mrs L asked Halifax for her dispute to be investigated again, something Im 
satisfied Halifax was prepared to do and would have gone on to do had E not refunded to 
Mrs Ls account £1,040.43 ($1,747.00 @ 1.67911) on 3 July. And because E refunded to 
Mrs Ls account £1,040.43 ($1,747.00 @ 1.67911) on 3 July Im not persuaded that Halifax 
did anything wrong in taking the decision to not investigate Mrs Ls dispute, after 3 July, any 
further. For the sake of completeness, I would add that Im not persuaded that Halifax did 
anything wrong in not progressing Mrs Ls dispute between 27 June and 3 July given that 
this period covers just a few working days.
I appreciate Mrs L might have incurred costs in pursuing matters directly with E, but what Im 
required to consider, and make a finding on, is Halifaxs handling of her dispute. And given 
what I say above Im satisfied that Halifaxs handling of Mrs Ls dispute was both fair and 
reasonable. 
I appreciate Mrs L will be disappointed, but for the reasons Ive given Im satisfied that 
Halifax need do nothing further than pay Mrs L £35.00 (as offered under cover of its FRL) 
where this sum hasnt already been paid to her. And for the avoidance of doubt Im satisfied 
that that this payment is sufficient to cover the £3.40 difference between the original debit of 
£1,043.83 and the later refund of £1,040.43 and any interest Mrs L might have lost out on.
My final decision
My final decision is that Bank of Scotland plc, to the extent it hasnt done so already, must 
pay Mrs L £35.00, but it need do nothing further. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
