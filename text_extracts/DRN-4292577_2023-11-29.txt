The complaint
Mr L complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money issued a default 
notice and defaulted his account despite Mr L making payments under a short term 
repayment plan.
What happened
Mr L held an account with 118 118 Money. In or around September 2022 he fell into arrears 
on the account.
Mr L subsequently agreed a short term repayment plan for the arrears. The first payment 
was due on 26 November 2022 and the plan was due to end on 26 January 2023.
Mr L made payments in accordance with the payment plan. He tried to use the account but 
found it had been blocked. Mr L contacted 118 118 Money to have the account unblocked 
but was advised that the account had been terminated on 1 January 2023 and could not be 
reinstated.
Mr L complained to 118 118 Money. He said hed expected to return to normal use of the 
account once hed cleared the arrears. He was unhappy that his credit file was reporting 
missed payments whilst hed been in the repayment plan.
In its final response, 118 118 Money said it had followed the appropriate procedures for 
account default and termination, and that it was obliged to report the account history 
accurately to the credit reference agencies.
Mr L remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said that although 118 118 Money couldve 
explained the repayment plan better, the default had been correctly applied.
Mr L didnt agree. He said hed been advised that collections activity would be paused whilst 
he cleared his arrears, and that the default notice shouldnt have been reported.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed Mr Ls account. I can see that the account fell into arrears in September 2022. 
I can also see that 118 118 Money issued a notice of default on 11 November 2022 
requesting payment of £424.34 by 1 January 2023.
Mr L contacted 118 118 Money on 23 November 2022 and set up a repayment plan for 3 
months.
Ive reviewed the correspondence between 118 118 Money and Mr L. 118 118 Money 
confirmed the repayment plan in an email dated 23 November 2022. It advised Mr L that 
collections activity would be suspended whilst the repayment plan was in place, but 
regulatory letters would still be issued. The letter also advised Mr L that whilst his account 
was in arrears, this may impact negatively on his credit file. 
I appreciate that Mr L thought that the email meant that his account wouldnt go into default 
provided that he stuck to the payment plan. But this isnt what the email says. The default 
notice had already been issued at the time when the payment arrangement was set up. I can 
see that Mr L had been behind with his contractual repayments since September at the time 
when the notice of default was issued on 11 November 2022. I cant say that 118 118 Money 
made an error when it issued the notice of default, because the ICO says that a business 
can register a default if a consumer is behind with repayments for three months.
Theres nothing in the email dated 23 November 2022 which says that the payment 
arrangement would prevent the account from defaulting. The reference to suspending 
collection activity meant that 118 118 Money wouldnt make further attempts to collect 
payment for the arrears. It didnt mean that the default notice would be cancelled.
I appreciate that Mr L made all of the payments under the payment plan. However, these 
payments didnt clear the arrears of £424.34 by 1 January 2023, which was what the notice 
of default required. So Im unable to say that 118 118 Money acted unfairly when it 
terminated the account on 1 January 2023.
Based on what Ive seen, I dont think that 118 118 Money has made an error here. It has 
followed the correct procedures for default and termination. Im unable to ask 118 118 
Money to remove the default because I cant see that it has been applied in error.
For the reasons Ive explained, Im unable to uphold the complaint. I wont be asking 118 
118 Money to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2023.
