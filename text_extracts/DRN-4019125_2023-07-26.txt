The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc declined his request to remortgage a 
property he rented out. He said NatWest mistakenly disregarded some sources of his 
income, and its decision not to lend was negligent.
What happened
Mr H applied to remortgage a home hed rented out, with NatWest, moving from a different 
lender, and adding about £25,000 of extra borrowing for property improvements. Mr H said 
he applied on 30 March, and the process took a long time, with NatWest making 
exceptionally detailed requests for information. 
On 21 July, the conveyancing firm NatWest appointed told Mr H his mortgage offer had been 
posted to him on 14 July. But on 2 August, he spoke to the firm again, and was told the 
lending wasnt going ahead. Mr H said NatWest didnt tell him it wouldnt lend, and he 
wanted compensation for its failure to lend him the requested amount. Mr H said NatWest 
had made its decision based on other data it held about him, which he thought was unlawful. 
NatWest said Mr H first applied for a BTL mortgage with it on 14 April, and his lending 
request was declined. Then it gave Mr H a second mortgage application appointment, on 22 
June. NatWest says this shouldnt have been offered, nothing had changed, so it was very 
unlikely Mr Hs second application would succeed. 
NatWest decided to turn down Mr Hs second application on 28 June. It couldnt contact Mr 
H to tell him this. It did tell his mortgage advisor and bank manager. No message was 
passed on to Mr H then, instead the mortgage advisor appealed, sending further information 
on Mr Hs income to the underwriter. This was reviewed on 11 July, and a final decision not 
to lend was made. NatWest thought Mr H should have been told about this on 11 July. 
But it didnt tell Mr H this, and it did then still carry out the arranged valuation of his property 
on 12 July. Mr H didnt find out his second application had been declined until early August. 
NatWest paid Mr H £350 to say sorry, and sent a gift to his address. The only address it had 
for him was his rented property, so the gift went to his tenants instead. NatWest said it would 
send this again, and said it had no other address for Mr H, hed declined to update this.
Mr H was concerned that NatWest had assessed his application against his personal 
income, which he said wasnt the right approach for BTL mortgages. NatWest explained why 
it took this approach in circumstances like Mr Hs, and said it didnt think this was a mistake. 
Mr H was confident NatWest must hold some data on him which it hadnt shared with him, 
and which led it to turn him down. Mr H said he wanted to see this, but NatWest said it had 
only considered his banking records with it, information hed supplied, and his credit report. 
Mr H said he was encouraged to make his second application by his personal bank 
manager, as some of his income had been ignored. Mr H said this application took up a 
considerable amount of his time, and also caused losses, leaving him less than 30 days to 
source an alternative loan. 
NatWest said Mr H passed the initial affordability assessment on his second application, but 
then underwriters decided this lending wasnt affordable. NatWest did say it was premature 
for it to have appointed solicitors and commissioned a valuation, so it was sorry for any 
inconvenience this caused Mr H. NatWest accepted that its service to Mr H fell short of the 
standards it aims to provide, but it thought its ultimate decision wasnt wrong. 
Our investigator thought NatWest should pay Mr H a little more compensation, to take the 
total up to £500. But he didnt think it had to change its mind about lending. He said NatWest 
is entitled to set its own lending criteria. He thought it applied those criteria fairly, and that its 
decision was based on assessing the documents Mr H provided as part of his application. 
Our investigator said NatWest never offered to lend to Mr H. But his expectations were 
raised by the second mortgage consultation. NatWest had apologised for this, and for not 
telling Mr H its lending decision on 11 July. Our investigator also thought starting the 
valuation and conveyancing early may also have raised Mr Hs expectations, and caused 
more inconvenience. So he suggested increasing the level of compensation paid to Mr H.
Mr H replied to object. He said hed only just received a response to a Subject Access 
Request (SAR) from NatWest. He said NatWests letter of 23 June said there was no 
further information required. Thats why he thought everything was fine, months after his 
applications. And in his view, rejecting an application as unaffordable while disregarding 
some income, was negligent. 
Our investigator noted the 23 June letter wasnt an offer and didnt give any commitment to 
lending. He said NatWest had assessed the documentation Mr H provided, in line with its 
lending policy, but then made a lending decision which was within its commercial discretion. 
Mr H disagreed, he still thought this was negligence.
NatWest said Mr H had written to it directly, to challenge its underwriters decision, which he 
now said was based on partial information. NatWest thought this should form part of the 
review our service was doing, so it wouldnt communicate with Mr H directly about this. 
This case then came to me for a final decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Part of Mr Hs complaint was about how long it took NatWest to reach a decision on his 
application. He said he first applied at the end of March, and didnt hear anything until 
August. But Mr Hs first mortgage appointment was held in mid-April. His application was 
then declined, so I dont think Mr H was misled into thinking that NatWest was considering 
his application at this stage.
Mr H reapplied at the end of June. I understand NatWest has expressed regret that Mr H 
was put to the trouble of submitting this second application. NatWest doesnt think he should 
have been encouraged to do this, because it was unlikely the lending decision would 
change. I think thats right. And NatWest expressed regret that Mr H wasnt told of its final 
decision earlier than August 2022, a decision that could have been communicated to him 
almost a month earlier. Again, I think thats right, NatWest has made a mistake in delaying 
its communications with Mr H.
I could understand why Mr H thought this application was going ahead, as not only was he 
not told of NatWests decision right away, but NatWest had also commissioned a valuation 
and instructed solicitors. So more of Mr Hs time was wasted, and I anticipate he would have 
been both disappointed and frustrated to find out later that NatWest wouldnt lend to him. I 
do think that what has gone wrong here shows service failings, and I agree with our 
investigator that NatWest should pay Mr H some additional compensation in this case. I also 
think that a total payment of £500 would provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this part 
of Mr Hs complaint.
However, like our investigator, I dont think our service is able to do for Mr H what it appears 
he would like, which is to overturn the decision NatWest made. Broadly speaking, it is for a 
bank to reach its own decisions on who to lend to, set against its own assessment of risk. Mr 
H has said he thinks NatWests assessment was negligent, because it ignored important 
parts of his income. But it looks to me as if NatWest did have at least high level information 
on the different sources of Mr Hs income. And I think NatWest was entitled to make its own 
decisions in this case on which income streams it considered would be appropriate for 
consideration as part of the support to the repayment of mortgage lending well into the 
future. 
My duty, in considering a complaint, is to decide it by reference to what is fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances. And here, although I do think Mr H has received some 
poor service from NatWest, as set out above, I dont think the core decision not to lend to 
him was likely to have changed, if these service lapses had not occurred. I also note that 
NatWest has told our service its underwriter has re-reviewed this decision once again, since 
it came to our service. It remains of the same view. So I dont think the final position of 
NatWest not lending to Mr H, represents an unfair or unreasonable outcome in this case.
I know Mr H will be disappointed by my decision, but I dont think that NatWest has to do 
more than pay the additional amount of compensation Im awarding here.My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr H £150, in addition to 
the payment of £350 it has already made.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2023
