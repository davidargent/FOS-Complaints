The complaint
Mr R complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) wont refund over £13,000 he lost as part of 
a cryptocurrency investment scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. In brief summary, Mr R fell victim to an investment scam beginning in June 2022 
after he found a broker (E) advertising cryptocurrency investment on social media (the 
scammer). He was encouraged to invest and made the following payments to his Coinbase 
wallet, where his funds were subsequently transferred on again to the scammer:
Payment 
No.Date Payee Amount Payment method
1. 20/06/2022 CB Payments £250 Debit card
2. 20/06/2022 CB Payments £683.38 Debit card
3. 26/06/2022 CB Payments £3,000 Debit card
4. 27/06/2022 CB Payments £2,090.87 Debit card

7. 27/06/2022 CB Payments £526.51 Debit card
8. 28/06/2022 CB Payments £2,616 Debit card
9. 28/06/2022 CB Payments £55.70 Debit card
10. 03/07/2022 CB Payments £100 Debit card
Total £13,505.26
Mr R eventually realised hed been scammed when he was unable to withdraw any of his 
profits.
Mr R reported the fraud to Monzo, but it refused to refund the money hed lost as it said hed 
authorised the payments and made them to his own account. Unhappy with this, Mr R 
referred the matter to our service. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He didnt think the first five payments Mr R made as 
part of the scam would have appeared particularly unusual or out of character, so they 
wouldnt have required any intervention by Monzo. However, when he came to make the 
£3,136.52 payment on 27 June 2022, the investigator thought Monzo should have made 
further enquiries as it was the third payment being made to the same payee in quick 
succession. 
Had Monzo intervened, the investigator thought any further financial loss to the scam could 
have been prevented, so the investigator asked that Monzo refund the payments made from 
this point onwards, albeit initially with a 50% deduction for Mr Rs own contributory 
negligence due to his lack of independent research into the scam broker.
Monzo agreed to settle the complaint on this basis and refunded 50% of the payments, 
totalling £3,217.37. However, Mr R disagreed. He thought that Monzo should have 
intervened sooner, and also didnt think it was fair for a deduction to be made for his lack of 
research, as there was no negative information about E he could have found at the time.
The investigator still didnt think there was any cause for Monzo to have intervened sooner 
that the £3,136.52 payment but altered his opinion on Mr Rs responsibility for his loss. The 
investigator issued a further view explaining that he didnt believe it would be fair to make a 
deduction for Mr Rs own contributory negligence because, although Mr R may not have 
carried out sufficient independent research, it didnt seem likely he would have found 
anything negative about the broker even if he had. So, he recommended that Monzo refund 
100% of the payments.
Mr R accepted the investigators recommendations and agreed to settle the complaint on 
this basis, but Monzo disagreed as it thought a 50% deduction was fair. As Monzo 
disagreed, the matter has been escalated to me to determine.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator and have decided 
to uphold it. 
It isnt in dispute that Mr R has fallen victim to a cruel scam here, nor that he authorised the 
payments. Monzo has also accepted that it should have intervened when he made the 
£3,136.52 payment on 27 June 2022, and that it could have likely prevented any further loss 
if it had done so, as it agreed to refund the payments made as part of the scam from this 
point onwards, albeit with a 50% deduction. Mr R has also since accepted that its from this 
payment that Monzo should have intervened, as he accepted the investigators most recent 
recommendations. Given these points are no longer in dispute, I do not intend to explore 
them any further.
What remains in dispute in this case is whether Monzo should refund 100% of the payments, 
or whether it would be fair and reasonable for it to only refund 50% in recognition of Mr Rs 
lack of due diligence and negligence that contributed to his loss. And having considered the 
arguments from both parties, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable to make a 
deduction for contributory negligence in these circumstances. Ill explain why.
Mr R said he carried out his own research into E by researching articles and having 
discussions with other investment companies. He also discussed safe ways of investing 
online with other friends and experienced investors and signed up to newsletters from 
investment news websites. He was also encouraged that he was paying money to Coinbase, which he had also researched and discovered was a legitimate cryptocurrency platform. 
I appreciate that this research does not necessarily pertain directly to the credentials and 
legitimacy of E who he was intending to invest with. But after carrying out my own research, 
it doesnt appear that Mr R would have found anything significantly adverse or negative 
about the broker at the time. So, even if he did fail to carry out sufficient due diligence, Im 
not persuaded he would have come across any warnings or been deterred from investing 
even if he had. Therefore, his lack of due diligence cannot be said to have contributed 
towards his loss in these circumstances, meaning it wouldnt be fair to make a deduction on 
that basis.
As a result, Im satisfied its fair and reasonable in all the circumstances for Monzo to refund 
100% of the payments Mr R made to the scammer, from the £3,136.52 payment made on 
27 June 2022 onwards.
Mr R has said the payments were funded by money from his business account that he 
transferred to his personal account in order to make the investment. If Monzo had 
intervened on 27 June 2022, it seems likely he would have returned the funds borrowed from 
his business back to its account. As a result, Im satisfied a fair rate of interest to pay on the 
award is the applicable business account rate at the time the payments were made. 
However, despite requests for evidence of his business account interest rate at the time, 
Mr R has not provided anything. So, unless he is able to provide this to Monzo, the bank will 
not have to pay any interest on his award. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Monzo Bank Ltd to:
Refund the payments Mr R made to the scammer from payment number six (outlined 
in the payment table above) onwards  totaling £6,434.73
Pay interest on this amount at the rate applicable (if any) to Mr Rs business account 
from which the funds were received, from the date of loss until the date of settlement. 
Mr R should provide reasonable evidence of the applicable interest rate at the time 
so Monzo can calculate the interest due, within 28 days of receiving his acceptance 
of this decision. If no evidence is received by this point, no interest will be payable on 
the award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2024.
