The complaint
Mrs B is unhappy with the service shes received from PrePay Technologies Limited.
What happened
Mrs B contacted PrePay because her existing travel card had expired, and she needed to
apply for a new one but was unable to do so. Mrs B wasnt happy about this, and she also
wasnt happy that she was incurring inactivity fees on the balance of her expired card whilst
being unable to apply for a new one. So, she raised a complaint.
Mrs B was promised a call back by PrePay but never received this call back. Mrs B wasnt
satisfied with how PrePay had tried to resolve her complaint. So, she referred her complaint
to this service.
In February 2023, one of our investigators looked at this complaint. They recommended that
PrePay should arrange to call Mrs B to walk her through the process of applying for a new
card. And they also recommended that PrePay should reimburse all inactivity fees applied to
the balance since March 2022  when Mrs B had been promised a call back from PrePay 
as well as make a payment of £35 to Mrs B in light of the trouble and upset shed incurred.
PrePay agreed to the recommendations put forwards by our investigator. But Mrs B never
received a call from PrePay to help her apply for a new card, and inactivity fees continued to
be charged to her existing balance. Mrs B remained dissatisfied with the service she was
receiving from PrePay, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 31 August 2023 as follows:
Its unfortunate that PrePay havent adhered to the recommendations put forwards by our 
investigator in February 2023  to which both PrePay and Mrs B agreed to accept as a 
resolution to this complaint.
Having agreed to our investigators recommendations, I feel that it was incumbent on PrePay
to have taken whatever action was necessary to adhere to them. And this includes exploring
alternative options of contacting Mrs B, or allowing Mrs B to contact them, to achieve the
result  the opening of a new card for Mrs B and the transferring of Mrs Bs existing balance
with them to that new card  that they committed to achieving when they accepted our
investigators recommendations.
Six months have now passed since our investigator issued their recommendations, and
PrePay still havent found a way to communicate with Mrs B. And PrePay also now appear
to have stopped communicating with this service about this ongoing matter.
Im satisfied that PrePays ongoing failures to resolve this matter constitute an ongoing
detriment to Mrs B for which she should fairly be compensated. And having reviewed how
PrePay have handled this matter since accepting the recommendations put forwards by our
investigator, Im not convinced that PrePay will be able to resolve Mrs Bs complaint as
theyve promised to.
As such, my provisional decision here is that I uphold this complaint in Mrs Bs favour and
instruct PrePay to reimburse all inactivity fees to the balance they hold for Mrs B from March
2022 onwards.
PrePay must then pay the amended balance to a bank account of Mrs Bs choosing, which
will be relayed to PrePay via this service. Its my understanding that Mrs Bs balance is
presently held with PrePay in Euros. If this is the case, then PrePay must exchange the
balance to GBP at present market rate without applying any fees to that exchange.
Additionally, PrePay must also make a payment of £250 to Mrs B for the ongoing frustration
and inconvenience that shes incurred here. In arriving at this amount, Ive considered the
impact that these events have had on Mrs B as well as the general framework which this
service uses when considering compensation amounts for upset and frustration, details of
which can be found on this services website.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mrs B and PrePay the opportunity to respond 
and to provide any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to issue a final decision.
Neither Mrs B nor PrePay provided any responses to this service. As such, I see no reason 
not to issue a final decision here whereby I uphold this complaint in Mrs Bs favour on the 
basis described above. And I therefore confirm that I do uphold this complaint on that basis 
accordingly.
Putting things right
PrePay must reimburse all inactivity fees to the balance they hold for Mrs B from March
2022 onwards.
PrePay must then pay the amended balance to a bank account of Mrs Bs choosing, which
will be relayed to PrePay via this service. 
If Mrs Bs balance is presently held with PrePay in Euros, then PrePay must exchange the
balance to GBP at present market rate without applying any fees to that exchange.
PrePay must also make a further payment of £250 to Mrs B for the ongoing frustration and 
inconvenience that shes incurred here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PrePay Technologies Limited on the 
basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2023.
