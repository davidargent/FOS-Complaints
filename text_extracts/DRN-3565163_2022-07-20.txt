The complaint
Mr S complains that Regency Health Ltd terminated their intermediary/client arrangement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator, and for these 
reasons:
Mr S had private medical insurance with an insurer, which Regency had arranged in 
its role as intermediary. 
When Mr S had a complaint against the insurer, he wanted Regency to represent him 
in this. Regency didnt wish to do so, and removed itself as his agent.
Regency has explained to Mr S its reasoning for no longer wishing to act as his 
agent, so I wont repeat this here.
Whilst I appreciate Mr S was disappointed with Regencys decision, its terms of 
business confirm that either party can terminate the arrangement by giving notice in 
writing. Regency did this, so I dont find that it did anything wrong. 
Mr S says that in terminating the arrangement, Regency didnt make allowances for 
his disability, as the cause of his complaint against the insurer related to his disability. 
However, I see that Regency notified the insurer of Mr Ss complaint, and that Mr S 
was able to correspond with the insurer about the matter himself. I dont find that 
Regency was required to continue working on Mr Ss behalf due to his disability.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2022.
