K820x#14complaint
Mr C and Miss M are unhappy  that, after issuing a conditional mortgage offer,  National 
Westminster Bank Plc later withdrew  the offer.
background
The events leading to the complaint can be summarised briefly. In 2019  Mr C and Miss M 
were re-mortgaging their property to NatWest,  through a mortgage broker. A mortgage  offer 
was issued which was conditional on NatWest being satisfied (amongst other things)  that:
There has been no material  change  in your circumstances  since  the date of this 
Offer, which we were not aware of, which could affect your ability  to afford  the 
loan. By this, we mean a change to your circumstances which,  had we known 
about it at the time of making  this Offer, might have  resulted in us being unable  to 
provide the Offer  to you or only being able to provide the Offer to you for a lower  
amount.
None of the information  which you have  provided as part of your application for 
the loan and which we have used  to decide whether to provide the Offer to you is 
untrue, inaccurate  or incomplete  or that you have not withheld information which 
we have requested  from you as part of your application for the loan which,  if we 
had received this information, might have resulted in us being unable to provide 
the Offer  to you or only being able to provide the Offer to you for a lower  amount;
After receiving further information from the broker, NatWest reviewed the application and 
withdrew the mortgage offer. The bank  said that the application no longer met its lending  
criteria.
Mr C and Miss M complained but NatWest didnt uphold the complaint. Mr C and Miss M 
contacted the Financial  Ombudsman Service. An investigator looked at the complaint, but 
didnt think it should be upheld. She was satisfied NatWest was entitled  to withdraw the 
mortgage offer and that it hadnt  acted unfairly  or unreasonably in doing so.
Mr C and Miss M asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint. They  say that they 
provided NatWest with the further  information  the bank had requested, and they dispute  they 
didnt meet NatWests  lending criteria.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator, for broadly the same reasons.
NatWest is entitled  to set its own lending criteria.  Decisions  that NatWest  makes in respect 
of what those criteria are, its attitude  to risk involved in this particular lending assessment, 
and whether it should lend and if so, on what terms are clearly discretionary matters for 
NatWests own commercial  judgement  that I would not interfere with. NatWests  full lending  
criteria are commercially sensitive and so Im satisfied that the bank is under no obligation  to 
disclose these to Mr C and Miss M. 
Where a complaint  is about the exercise  by a lender  of its commercial judgment my role is to 
decide whether  that judgement has been  exercised fairly and reasonably;  it isnt to substitute 
Ref: DRN28429062my own judgement for that of NatWest. In other words, I have to decide if NatWest  took into 
account all relevant factors and gave proper  consideration to them before reaching its 
decision. It is only if I thought no lender could reasonably  have made the decisions NatWest 
made in this case that there would be any basis for intervention on my part.
Im satisfied that NatWest  gave fair consideration to this application  and so legitimately  
exercised its commercial judgement when the bank decided to withdraw the mortgage offer. 
There was no obligation on NatWest to give reasons for this. In the circumstances, Im 
satisfied this means that there is no basis upon  which I can find that NatWest has treated 
Mr C and Miss M unfairly  or unreasonably.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr C and Miss M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  16 April 2020.
