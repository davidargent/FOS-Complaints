The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved him for a credit account which
was unaffordable for him at that time and later increased the credit limit on that account,
which Mr H also feels was unaffordable for him at that time.
What happened
Mr H applied for a credit account with NewDay in 2018. Mr Hs application was approved,
and he was issued with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £300. Several months
later, Mr H applied for an increase to the credit limit on the account. Mr H requested that the
credit limit be increased to £800. However, NewDay only approved an increase in the credit
limit to £500. No further increases to the credit limit on Mr Hs account were approved or
proposed by NewDay.
In April 2020, Mr H raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he felt that both the
initial provision of credit, and the later credit limit increase, had been unaffordable for him at
those times.
NewDay looked at Mr Hs complaint. They felt that they had undertaken reasonable checks
into Mr Hs financial position both at the time of the initial account application and Mr Hs
later request for a credit limit increase, and that there had been nothing in any of those
checks that should have suggested to them that the credit limits being provided to Mr H
wouldnt be affordable for him at those times. So, NewDay didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that there was nothing in the
information that NewDay had gathered at the time of the initial account application which
should have made them consider that Mr H wouldnt have been able to afford an account
with a £300 credit limit, so they didnt uphold that aspect of Mr Hs complaint.
However, our investigator felt that it should have been evident to NewDay, based on the way
in which Mr H had used his account since it was opened, and the amount of other external
debt that Mr H held at that time, that it was probable that Mr H wouldnt be able to afford the
credit limit increase from £300 to £500. So, our investigator recommended that this
complaint be upheld in Mr Hs favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 25 August 2021 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the business 
would undertake reasonable and proportionate borrower focussed checks to be sure 
that any credit being offered to a customer, including any limit increases to already 
existing credit, is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that theyve done that here. When Mr H first applied for the credit 
account, NewDay took information about his income and expenditure from Mr H to be 
sure that Mr H would be able to afford any potential monthly repayments. NewDay 
also obtained information from a credit reference agency about Mr H to gain a better 
understanding of Mr Hs wider financial position. And NewDay contend that there was 
nothing resulting from these checks that should have given them cause to consider 
that approving Mr H for a credit account with an initial credit limit of £300 would be 
unaffordable for him.
Having reviewed the information that NewDay gathered and assessed when 
considering Mr Hs account application, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to have made such a conclusion. And I say this because Mr H confirmed to 
NewDay that he was employed with a gross annual income of approximately £20,000 
and because Mr Hs credit file information didnt show any recent adverse information 
or indicate that Mr H was struggling to manage his other existing credit at that time.
Furthermore, when Mr H later applied for a credit limit increase on his account, 
NewDay reviewed Mr Hs management of his NewDay up that time and received 
updated information from a credit reference agency about Mr Hs wider financial 
position.
Our investigator felt that the information that NewDay assessed regarding Mr Hs
management of his NewDay account should have given NewDay cause to consider 
that a credit limit increase might not be affordable for Mr H at that time. And our 
investigator felt this way because Mr H had maintained his account balance close to 
the credit limit and had only paid the minimum payments towards the account.
I can appreciate our investigators position here, but Im not convinced that Mr Hs
management of his account as described should have given NewDay cause for 
concern. I say this because, while Mr H had maintained his balance close to the 
credit limit, he hadnt exceeded the credit limit at any time, and he hadnt incurred 
any over-limit fees which might indicate to me that he was struggling to manage the 
account at any point. And I dont feel that Mr Hs maintaining a credit account 
balance under the credit limit without missing any minimum payments or ever 
exceeding the credit limit on that account, as Mr H did, should be considered as a 
reasonable indicator that Mr H might not be able to afford further credit.
Its also evident from the information that NewDay gathered from the credit reference 
agency that Mr H appeared to be continuing to manage his other external credit 
without incident, including no recent missed payments on any of his other accounts. 
And, while our investigator did note that Mr Hs amount of external debt stood at 
£27,000 at that time, which was greater than his stated annual income, its notable 
that this amount of other existing credit had remained stable for some time, and I 
dont feel that it should have caused NewDay to consider that the provision of a 
relatively small increase to Mr Hs credit limit, up to £500, would have been 
unaffordable for him at that time.
I also dont feel that any additional checks, beyond which NewDay undertook at that 
time, were warranted. I say this because credit providers have an obligation to undertake checks that are reasonable and proportionate. Given that the credit limit 
on Mr Hs account was relatively small, even after the increase to £500, Im satisfied 
that the checks that NewDay undertook were reasonable and proportionate and that 
further levels of checks wouldnt have been proportionate when considered against 
the amount of credit being provided.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that NewDay have acted unfairly 
or unreasonably here, and Im satisfied that the checks that NewDay undertook both 
at the time of the initial account application and the later credit limit increase 
furnished them with a picture of Mr Hs overall creditworthiness from which it was 
reasonable for NewDay to conclude that the credit being offered to Mr H at those 
times wouldnt be unaffordable for him.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr H wants here, but it follows that my
provisional decision will be that I do not uphold this complaint and that I wont be 
asking NewDay to take any further action at this time.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr H and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision. NewDay confirmed that they were happy to accept my provisional decision, 
whereas Mr H did not respond. 
As such, I see no reason not to issue my final decision on the same basis as explained 
above in my provisional decision, and it follows from this that my final decision will be that I 
do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2021.
