K821x#15Complaint
Mr O says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him. He says 
he couldnt afford the loans.
Background
This complaint is about 20 payday  loans  and 1 flex credit account QuickQuid provided  to
Mr O between July 2011 and September 2014.  A summary of Mr Os lending history is 
attached as an appendix at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Os complaint in part and thought that the available  information  
didnt show that it was wrong for QuickQuid to lend Mr O loans 1 to 5. Our adjudicator 
thought that loans 6 onwards shouldnt have been  given and recommended  that the 
complaint about  those  loans should  be upheld. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint  was 
passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN34697902Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The previous regulators (the OFT) Irresponsible 
Lending Guidance  (ILG) defined sustainability in similar terms and applies to Mr Os earlier 
loans. And it follows that a lender  should  realise,  or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  
that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.  In its initial  response to the service 
QuickQuid acknowledged  that it shouldnt have  given Mr O the final top-ups on loans  7 and 
15 together with loans  8 to 12 and 16 to 19. QuickQuid offered to refund the interest and 
charges on these loans.
When our adjudicator looked  at the complaint, she explained that QuickQuids checks for 
loans 1 and 2 were  fair but that for loans 3 to 5, QuickQuid  should have taken its checks  
further. She also explained that she didnt have enough information to suggest that 
QuickQuid shouldnt have  lent Mr O loans  3 to 5. But based on Mr Os pattern of lending, 
more loans should be upheld. She recommended  that loans 6 to 21 should be upheld.
Neither Mr O nor his representatives have  disagreed  with the adjudicator not upholding 
loans 1 to 5, so it follows  that there  isnt a continuing dispute about those loans. Also as 
QuickQuid acknowledges  that it shouldnt have lent some of the loans, Ive focused my 
decision on the loans  still in dispute  loans 6, 7 (including its top-ups), 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21 
(flex credit account).
As well as looking at the individual  affordability  of the loans, Ive also looked  at the overall  
pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr O, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because by loan 6, Mr O had been borrowing from QuickQuid for around 7 
months without any significant  breaks and the loan amounts were generally increasing and 
by loan 6, I think  Mr O had established  a pattern of borrowing that shouldve concerned 
QuickQuid.
From loan 6 onwards Mr O was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a previous 
one and on some occasions he was given  a new loan on the day he repaid the previous 
loan. So QuickQuid  ought to have realised  it was more likely  than not Mr O was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and 
that Mr Os indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.  This is borne out by Mr O regularly 
topping-up several of his loans, For example, Mr O topped up loan 14 five times, taking his 
total borrowing  for loan 14 to around £850. Most  of Mr Os loans from loan 7 onwards were 
between £600  and £1,250. So I agree  with QuickQuid that it shouldnt have lent the loans its 
made offers on but I think Mr Os concerning pattern  started from loan 6 and continued to the 
end of the lending relationship.
Ref: DRN34697903From the lending history, I think Mr O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed 
QuickQuid. Loan  21 was taken out more than 36 months after Mr Os first and it was for a 
larger amount  around 10 times  that amount of loan 1. So Mr O had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period. QuickQuid itself 
acknowledges that its loans arent  suitable  for long term use.
I think that Mr O lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Os 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I dont  think QuickQuid  shouldve given Mr O loans 6 to 21 and Im upholding his 
complaint about  those  loans.
Putting things  right  what  QuickQuid needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 6 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 21 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Os complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr O compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
