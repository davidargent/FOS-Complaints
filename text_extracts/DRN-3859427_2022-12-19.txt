The complaint
Mr W is unhappy that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, didnt accept hed
been the victim of a scam and that hed applied for a loan with them as a result of that scam.
Mr W is also unhappy that 118 118 continue to hold him liable for the loan instalments he
didnt pay while his fraud claim was being investigated by 118 118 and that his credit file has
been adversely affected as a result.
What happened
Mr W successfully applied for a £4,000 personal loan with 118 118. He received the loan
funds into his current account held with a third-party bank, from where it was transferred to
what Mr W believed was a legitimate investment opportunity but which he soon after
discovered was a scam.
 
Mr W contacted 118 118 and explained hed been the victim of a scam. 118 118 placed Mr
Ws account on hold while they conducted a fraud investigation, during which time Mr W
didnt make any monthly repayments towards the loan. Several months later, 118 118
concluded that no evidence of fraud was present, and they advised Mr W that the loan
payments hed missed while the investigation was ongoing were considered as being in
arrears and would be reported as such to the credit reference agencies. Mr W wasnt happy
about this, so he raised a complaint.
 
118 118 looked at Mr Ws complaint, but they confirmed that they hadnt accepted Mr Ws
fraud claim and they didnt feel that theyd acted unfairly by reporting the arrears that had
accrued on Mr Ws account while the fraud claim had been ongoing to Mr Ws credit file.
 
Mr W wasnt satisfied with 118 118s response, especially as his current account provider
had accepted that he had been scammed and had reimbursed in full the money Mr W had
transferred to the scammers. So, he referred his complaint to this service.
 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that 118 118 money
had acted unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so they didnt uphold the
complaint. Mr W remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 14 November 2022 as follows:
I can appreciate why 118 118 might not have felt that there was any evidence 
discernible to themselves which suggested that Mr W might have been the victim of a 
scam. However, its unfortunately the case that the perpetrators of such scams may 
often guide their victims into obtaining credit legitimately and will then later induce 
their victims into forwarding the credit proceeds to them from a third-party source.
 
This appears to be what happened in this instance. Mr W applied for a loan with 118 
118, the proceeds of which were received by Mr W into his current account which he 
holds with a reputable third-party bank. And it was from Mr Ws current account that 
the scammers induced Mr W to transfer the proceeds of the 118 118 loan to them.
 
But while the signs of a scam may not have been directly available to 118 118, they 
were directly available to Mr Ws current account provider, which has accepted that 
Mr W was scammed, and which has reimbursed the full value of the money which Mr 
W forwarded to the scammers to Mr W. And given that Mr Ws current account 
provider was the best placed party to assess whether Mr W was or wasnt the victim 
of a scam here  given the money movements as Ive described them above  Im 
happy to accept the position of Mr Ws current provider that Mr W was in fact the 
victim of a scam.
 
Notably, Mr Ws current account provider confirmed in writing to Mr W that they were
satisfied he was the victim of a scam approximately two months before 118 118 
reached their own conclusion that there was no evidence that Mr W had been 
scammed. And Mr W has confirmed that he forwarded the letter from his bank, 
confirming their acceptance that he had been scammed, to 118 118.
 
As such, I find it difficult to understand how 118 118 also didnt accept, either during 
their initial investigation or following Mr Ws subsequent complaint, that Mr W had in 
fact been scammed  given that the financial institution best placed to make that 
assessment had agreed that a scam had taken place.
 
All of which means Im satisfied that Mr W has been the victim of a scam here. And 
given that Mr W applied for the 118 118 loan because of that scam, it seems fair to 
me that Mr W should be put back in the position he would be in had he never applied 
for that loan. 
This includes that Mr W should pay back the capital balance of the loan  which its 
my understanding that Mr W has already done  and not be charged any interest on 
it. And I also feel that this loan, and any credit searches undertaken on Mr W by 118 
118 during the application process, should be deleted from Mr Ws credit file as if the 
loan had never been applied for.
 
As such, Ill be provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Ws favour, and 
instructing 118 118 as follows:
 
Its my understanding Mr W has made payments to this loan totaling £4,400, 
which is £400 more than the £4,000 capital balance of the loan, and with the 
date of the most recent payment made by Mr W being 13 August 2021. 118 118 
must therefore reimburse this £400 overpayment to Mr W along with 8% simple 
interest on that amount calculated from 13 August 2021 to the date of the 
reimbursement to Mr W.
118 118 must also remove all credit reporting relating to this loan from Mr Ws 
credit file, including any credit searches that 118 118 undertook on Mr W as 
part of the loan application process.
Finally, 118 118 must make a further payment of £200 to Mr W to compensate 
him for the trouble and upset that hes incurred here as a result of 118 118 not 
fairly recognising that he has been the victim of a scam, which I feel that 118 118 reasonably should have done, given the information presented to them by 
Mr W as described above.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr W and 118 118 the opportunity to provide 
any comments of new information they might wish me to consider before I move to issue a 
final decision. Mr W confirmed he was happy to accept my provisional decision, whereas 
118 188 did provide some further comments for my review. 
The first point 118 118 raise is that they have no record of Mr W providing them with the 
letter he received from his bank which confirmed that his bank was accepting that hed been 
the victim of fraud. 
Its notable that the letter Mr W received from his bank is dated 12 April 2021. Mr W 
therefore received this letter before June 2021, which was when 118 118 rejected the fraud 
claim hed submitted to them, and before 5 August 2021, which was when 118 118 
communicated to Mr W that hadnt upheld his subsequent complaint about his fraud claim.
Mr W confirmed to this service that he did provide a copy of the letter from his bank to 118 
118, and it seems very unlikely to me that Mr W wouldnt have done so, given that he had 
raised a fraud claim with 118 118 on a similar basis to that which hed raised with his bank.
Additionally, it isnt in dispute that Mr W raised a fraud claim with 118 118 and provided 118 
118 with details as to the fraud claim he was raising. These details included that the 118 118 
loan proceeds had been forwarded to the fraudsters from his bank, who had subsequently 
accepted that Mr W had been defrauded. 
As such, if 118 118 didnt have a copy of the letter in question from Mr Ws bank on file, for 
whatever reason, its difficult to understand why 118 118 didnt ask Mr W to provide one, or 
how 118 118 arrived at an outcome in regard to their own fraud investigation without it.
118 118 have also expressed their concerns with the overall position of my provisional 
decision and maintain that Mr W applied for a loan with them which they approved in good 
faith, and that Mr W then received the loan funds and used them as he saw fit. And because 
of this, 118 118 maintain that this complaint shouldnt be upheld.
I find 118 118s position here to be highly concerning. This is because 118 118 seem unable 
to accept that Mr W was the victim of a scam here. And because 118 118 also seem unable 
to accept that Mr W should be protected against the negative consequences of such a scam, 
even if the nature of that scam was such that the movement of money to the fraudsters took 
place from Mr Ws bank account  rather than being directly from 118 118 themselves.
Mr W isnt asking 118 118 to write off the balance of the loan he took with them. Rather, hes 
only asking to be allowed to return the capital balance of the loan to 118 118 so that he 
doesnt incur the financial detriment of having to pay the loan interest for a loan he was 
coerced into taking out on false pretenses by fraudsters, or be unduly punished for not 
making payments towards the loan while 118 118 were arriving at the perplexing result to 
the fraud claim he raised with them that they did. And given that Im satisfied that Mr W has 
been the victim of a sophisticated fraud here, his requests in this regard seem entirely fair 
and reasonable to me. 
All of which means that I will be upholding this complaint in Mr Ws favour on the same basis 
as outlined in my provisional decision letter. 
 Putting things right
118 118 must reimburse to Mr W any amount that Mr W has paid to them above the £4,000 
capital balance of the loan, along with 8% simple interest on that reimbursed amount for the 
time that 118 118 have held it. 
For instance, its my understanding that Mr W has made payments to this loan totaling 
£4,400. This is £400 more than the £4,000 capital balance of the loan, with the date of the 
most recent payment made by Mr W being 13 August 2021. If this understanding is correct, 
118 118 must reimburse this £400 overpayment to Mr W along with 8% simple interest on 
that amount calculated from 13 August 2021 to the date of the reimbursement back to Mr W.
118 118 must also remove all credit reporting relating to this loan from Mr Ws credit file, 
including any credit searches that 118 118 undertook on Mr W as part of the loan application 
process.
Finally, 118 118 must make a further payment of £200 to Mr W to compensate him for the 
trouble and upset hes incurred here as a result of 118 118 not fairly recognising that he has 
been the victim of a scam, which I continue to feel 118 118 reasonably should have done, 
given the information available to them.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 
118 118 Money, on the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 January 2023.
