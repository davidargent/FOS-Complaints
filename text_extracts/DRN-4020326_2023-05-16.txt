The complaint
Mr P complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) was irresponsible 
to lend to him.
What happened
Mr P had one loan from 118 118 Money in February 2021 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 14 Feb 2021 £2,000 24m £133.85 1 Mar 2023 Debt sold Jul 2022
Mr P says he already had a 118 118 Money credit card at its limit when he applied for the 
loan. He says 118 118 Money should have seen that and a number of other credit cards and 
declined the loan application. Mr P adds that he couldnt keep up with the repayments and 
had to borrow more money.
118 118 Money says it asked Mr P about his, income, expenditure, employment and 
personal circumstances. It says the information he provided, combined with details from his 
credit file means that it was satisfied the loan application was correctly approved.
Our investigator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She found the checks 
carried out by 118 118 Money were proportionate and that there was nothing in the available 
information that meant the lending was irresponsible.
Mr P responded to say that hed like to refer the complaint to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when 118 118 Money lent to Mr P. 
Its rules and guidance obliged it to lend responsibly. As set out in the regulators Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook (CONC), this meant that 118 118 Money needed to take reasonable and 
proportionate steps to assess whether or not a borrower could afford to meet their loan 
repayments in a sustainable manner over the lifetime of the agreement.
CONC 5.2A.4R states that:
A firm must undertake a reasonable assessment of the creditworthiness of a customer 
before:
1. entering into a regulated credit agreement; or
2. significantly increasing the amount of credit provided under a regulated credit 
agreement, or
3. significantly increasing a credit limit for running-account credit under a regulated 
credit agreement.
Repaying debt in a sustainable manner was defined as being able to meet repayments out 
of normal income without the customer having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment the customer has a contractual or statutory obligation to 
make and without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on the customers 
financial situation (CONC 5.2A.12R).
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
borrower of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance, potentially by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a persons income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is 
likely to be greater and the borrower is required to make payments for an extended 
period).
In addition, as per CONC 5.2A.16G (3): For the purpose of considering the customers 
income, it is not generally sufficient to rely solely on a statement of current income made by 
the customer without independent evidence (for example, in the form of information supplied 
by a credit reference agency or documentation of a third party supplied by the third party or 
by the customer).
And CONC 5.2A.17R (2) says: The firm must take reasonable steps to determine the 
amount, or make a reasonable estimate, of the customers current non-discretionary 
expenditure.
Bearing all of this in mind, in coming to a decision on Mr Ps case, I have considered the 
following questions:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing 
Mr Ps loan application to satisfy itself hed be able to sustainably repay the loan? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
When Mr P applied for the loan, Ive seen evidence to show 118 118 Money checked his 
credit file and asked about his income and personal circumstances. These checks showed:A declared income of £1,690 per month;
Mr P was a homeowner with no mortgage and no dependants;
An historic default on a utility account in March 2015 that was satisfied in June 2015;
Four active credit card accounts:
oThey had a combined balance of £3,416, with a total credit limit of £3,700
One further credit card with a zero balance;
An overdraft limit of £600 on his current account;
Based on the above Im satisfied that 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough because:
118 118 Money said it verified Mr Ps income and, indeed, I have now seen evidence 
that his income was over £1,700 at the time;
Mr Ps credit file had no current adverse information and his total debt was £3,416;
With current credit commitments of less than £200 per month and no mortgage or 
rent to pay, Mr P would have had over £1,500 per month with which to meet his 
regular expenditure and the additional loan repayments.
I can see Mr P made his repayments on time until March 2022 and, after no further 
payments, the debt was sold to a third party in July 2022. Whilst I accept that Mr P found 
himself in financial difficulties, I cant say 118 118 Money should have seen any evidence of 
that when the loan was approved in February 2021.
Based on all the evidence, I find 118 118 Money completed reasonable and proportionate 
checks, made a fair lending decision, and I cant see it acted unfairly in any other way.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2023.
