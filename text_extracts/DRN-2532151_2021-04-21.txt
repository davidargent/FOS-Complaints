The complaint
Mr P complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have acted unfairly in pursuing 
him for a debt following an error made by them, when incorrectly crediting his bank account 
with a large sum. 
What happened
Mr P says following the passing of his late wife, NatWest credited his bank account with two 
large payments which he believed were monies held in her bank account. A few days later 
NatWest requested these monies back as they said they had made an error and the funds 
belonged to another customer and not Mr Ps late wife. Mr P says NatWest acted 
aggressively towards him in pursuing the monies he owed them, they also withdrew his 
overdraft facility, and this added further stress and anxiety to him. Mr P feels NatWest should 
compensate him for the trouble and upset they have caused him.
NatWest accept they made a mistake when they credited Mr Ps account initially, but these 
funds didnt belong to Mr Ps late wife and they acted correctly requesting these funds be 
returned. NatWest have asked Mr P to repay the residual amount he still owes after they 
reversed as much of the amount it credited to his bank account, as they could.  
Mr P wasnt happy with NatWests response and employed solicitors to act on his behalf to 
bring a complaint to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but felt the complaint needed to be 
split into two complaints, one in the name of Mr P and one in the name of the Estate of the 
late Mrs P, given the limitation this service has on dealing with awards for bodies, like the 
Estate,  rather than individuals. The investigator partly upheld Mr Ps complaint and felt a 
compensation payment of £250 was fair to recompense him for the trouble and upset 
caused. That said following further discussions the investigator held with NatWest and the 
solicitors acting for Mr P, NatWest agreed to pay a proportion of the solicitors fees Mr P had 
incurred for this element of his complaint to this service and an additional payment of £500 
for the trouble and upset caused.
Mr P wasnt happy with the revised offer by NatWest as he believed they had agreed to pay 
all his solicitors fees relating to this complaint, so asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator here, taking into 
account the revised offer of compensation she has put to Mr P, and I will explain how I have 
come to my decision. 
I can see it would have been a difficult time for Mr P following the passing of his wife and 
having to deal with her affairs, which no doubt was a stressful and upsetting time for him. 
This would have been made even more stressful, thinking a large sum credited to his bank 
account was due to him from his late wife, only to be told it was a mistake and needed to be 
repaid.
When looking at this complaint I will not consider the concerns put to this service regarding 
the Estate of Mr Ps late wife as that complaint will be dealt with separately, on its own 
merits. I will consider if NatWest have acted unreasonably when dealing with the error they 
initially caused by crediting Mr Ps bank account, and if the level of compensation they have 
offered is fair. 
What happened here is following the passing of Mr Ps wife NatWest credited his bank 
account initially with £275.19 in early June 2019 and subsequently with two sums totalling 
close to £37,000, later that month. Mr P says he had no reason to feel these two later 
payments werent correct but only a few days later NatWest told him these monies belonged 
to another customer and the monies needed to be returned. A few days following this, given 
the balance available on Mr Ps account NatWest debited Mr Ps account with £30,000 and 
requested his instructions for the repayment of the residual sum. 
Mr P says that NatWest became aggressive with him in pursuance of the outstanding 
monies and despite him asking NatWest to direct further communication to his solicitor on 
this matter, he still continued to receive contact directly from NatWest, adding further stress 
to an already difficult situation. 
Mr P and his legal advisors have asked why NatWest cant provide copies of the phone calls 
they have had concerning this matter as they feel it supports their claim NatWest have been 
unreasonable in the way they have dealt with the issue here. Like the investigator says, this 
service has asked for call recordings but unfortunately these are not available, and I will take 
this into account, but clearly cant make these call recordings appear if theyre not available. 
Its worth saying, from the information I have seen, there is no dispute the monies initially 
credited to Mr Ps bank account, was a mistake made by NatWest and they have apologised 
for this as I would expect. The key issue raised by Mr P here is the stress and upset 
NatWest have caused him pursuing the residual balance and the cost he has gone to, trying 
to get the matter resolved. 
I can see Mr P has felt the need to employ solicitors to deal with his complaint and this has 
created costs to him as a result. While Mr P may not agree, although he felt this course of 
action was needed it was his decision to do so and this case could have been bought to this 
service without the need to employ legal representation. I have no evidence to support Mr 
Ps complaint that NatWest have acted aggressively towards him on pursuing the residual 
balance, although it is disappointing any calls that could have helped in this matter have not 
been available. 
On balance, Ive no reason to doubt Mr Ps view that NatWest have pursued him for the 
monies owed, but that said they are entitled to request the repayment of this sum, even if the 
initial mistake was theirs. I take the view, given the circumstances here, Mr P would have 
been going through a difficult time and a good degree of understanding and forbearance was 
needed by NatWest. This could have been made clearer in any correspondence NatWest 
sent to Mr P to put his mind at rest, although I cant see it has here and the lack of any call 
recordings hasnt helped my understanding of how NatWest dealt with Mr P over this matter.
I am pleased to see after further negotiations with the investigator, NatWest have now 
offered to pay some of Mr Ps legal costs relating to the complaint. This amounts to 50% of 
the total fees detailed by his solicitors as being £2,037.84 in total, and in addition NatWest have agreed to pay a further sum of £500 in recognition of the trouble and upset caused. 
While Mr P says this is less than NatWest agreed to settle recently, I am satisfied this offer 
represents a payment for the fees relative to this particular part of Mr Ps complaint to this 
service. As I have said before, I am satisfied Mr P took the decision to employ solicitors, so I 
cant penalise NatWest for that as while Mr P felt it was in his best interest to do so, thats 
not to say the complaint couldnt have been brought to NatWest or this service without it. 
Its important now that Mr P discusses with NatWest a suitable payment plan for the residual 
debt outstanding and like the investigator here, given the initial mistake made this plan 
should be free of any further interest and costs to Mr P. If the overdraft facility that I 
understand was removed needs reinstating, this should be considered as part of those 
proposals, subject to NatWests usual criteria.
While Mr P may not agree, I am satisfied the offer of compensation of £500 and the part 
payment of the itemised fees provided by his solicitors, is a fair and reasonable for the 
trouble and upset it has caused. 
While Mr P will be disappointed with my decision, I will not be asking NatWest to pay any 
more than this. 
Putting things right
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 50% of the itemised solicitors fees which 
comes to a sum of £1,018.92, plus and an additional sum of £500 for the trouble and upset 
caused, making a total payment of £1,518.92.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 50% of the itemised solicitors fees which 
comes to a sum of £1,018.92, plus and an additional sum of £500 to Mr P for the trouble and 
upset caused, making a total payment of £1,518.92.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
