Complaint
Mr A says PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt do enough to help him when he 
was the victim of a scam.
  
Background
In August 2018, Mr A saw an advert online for a hot tub. He contacted the seller who asked 
to be paid via PayPal. Mr A paid the seller £400 using PayPals friends and family payment 
option and agreed a mutually convenient date for delivery. When this item wasnt delivered 
on the specified date, Mr A became suspicious. He contacted the company he believed the 
seller to work for. He was told the seller had never been an employee there. He feared that 
hed been the victim of a scam and so he contacted PayPal to tell it what had happened.
From what Mr A has told us, PayPal froze the £400 payment and told him theyd investigate. 
He says PayPal looked into whether or not Mr A had authorised the payment. It found no 
evidence of unauthorised use of the account and so released the payment of the £400. Mr A 
says that PayPal significantly misconstrued his complaint. He hadnt claimed that the 
payment was unauthorised  he accepts he made the payment, but that he did so in 
connection with a scam. 
Mr A complained that PayPal hadnt done enough to protect him from fraud. PayPal rejected 
his complaint. It said that hed had authorised the payment so there was nothing more it 
could do. Furthermore, hed chosen to make the payment using the friends and family 
option which (in accordance with the terms and conditions of his account) meant he didnt 
have the benefit of buyer protection.
Mr A was unhappy with this, so he referred a complaint to this service. It was looked at by an 
Investigator who upheld it. The Investigator said that PayPal has a legal obligation to prevent 
the movement of funds that may be the result of fraudulent activity and to minimise the 
impact of fraud on its customers. The evidence that been supplied suggested that PayPal 
chose to release the £400 payment after it had been told by Mr A that he suspected he was 
the victim of a scam and without looking into whether his concerns were valid.
PayPal disagreed with the investigators opinion. It said that, as Mr A had chosen to pay 
using the friends and family option, there was nothing further they could do. As PayPal 
disagreed with the investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to me to consider 
and issue a final decision.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I find it more likely than not that Mr A was the victim of a scam here. Its an increasingly 
common tactic for scammers to offer goods for sale online with no intention of delivering 
them. In this instance, the scammer appears to have successfully gained access to a 
companys email domain to create a false email address. It hasnt been possible for Mr A to 
contact the scammer since he made the payment. This persuades me that its likely the 
seller didnt intend to genuinely deliver the goods Mr A was interested in buying.
In circumstances such as these, PayPal has a range of obligations. The investigator has set 
these out at length in her view of the complaint, so I wont repeat them here. It is, however, 
worth adding that as a regulated firm, Paypal was required to conduct its business with due 
skill, care and diligence (FCA Principle for Businesses 2) and to pay due regard to the 
interests of its customers (Principle 6).
The fact that the terms and conditions of Mr As agreement with PayPal treats payments 
made using the friends and family option differently doesnt mean that these obligations 
dont apply. Once Mr A told PayPal that he suspected hed been the victim of a scam, it 
shouldve investigated his concerns more closely to find out whether there was substance to 
them. If it had done so, its likely it wouldve been able to prevent Mr A from being the victim 
of a scam. If, as Mr A has claimed, PayPal failed to genuinely investigate the substance of 
his complaint because it had misunderstood it, Im satisfied this would fall below the 
standard of due skill and care required of regulated firms. 
Overall, Im persuaded that PayPal missed an opportunity to protect Mr A from financial 
harm. If it had acted appropriately when notified of a potential scam, its likely it wouldve 
been able to prevent Mr As payment from being transferred to the scammer.   
Final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold this complaint.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA now needs to refund the payment to Mr A. It will also need 
to add 8% simple interest per annum from the date the payment was made until the date it 
pays the refund to Mr A.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2021.
