The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused to refund him for an order he 
didnt receive. 
What happened
In March 2021, Mr S ordered an item on an online marketplace for £1,250. He paid for it 
using PayPal. When the item didnt arrive, Mr S contacted the seller.
The seller accepted the item was delivered to the wrong address and agreed to refund Mr S. 
But when the refund was taking too long, Mr S contacted PayPal. 
PayPal refused to provide Mr S a refund as the seller provided them with shipment tracking 
information which confirmed the order was delivered. 
Mr S referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator felt that the proof of delivery 
provided didnt meet the requirements of PayPals User Agreement. 
She recommended Mr S should be refunded the full amount and be compensated £100 for 
the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr S accepted. PayPal disagreed and maintained that the claim was correctly denied as the 
item was delivered within an acceptable radius of Mr S address. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at PayPals User Agreement. This explains Mr S is entitled to reimbursement of 
the full purchase price, plus postage costs if he encounters specified problems with a 
transaction. 
One of the specified problems is if Mr S didnt receive an item from a seller. These types of 
claims are referred to as Item Not Received. PayPals Buyer Protection says that a claim will 
not qualify for a refund under Item Not Received if:
The seller has provided proof of delivery.
PayPal has refused Mr S claim because the seller provided shipment tracking information. 
Ive looked at the criteria of proof of delivery under PayPals User Agreement. This says:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the 
"Transaction Details" page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or 
zip/postal code (or international equivalent).
Id expect the Proof of delivery to meet all three of the above requirements. Ive compared 
the criteria against the evidence PayPal have provided to show the item was delivered. 
The shipment tracking information shows that an item was delivered and signed for on 18 
March 2021 at 10:49am. 
But this alone isnt sufficient to meet PayPals criteria for Proof of delivery as it doesnt have 
the details of where it was delivered to. 
Also, the item being delivered to a post office within an acceptable radius of Mr S address 
isnt enough to show the item was delivered to Mr S address, as per the requirement of 
Proof of delivery.
PayPal havent provided any evidence to show where the item was shipped, such as a copy 
of postage receipt or a photo of the shipping label. 
I think this is key evidence to determine the second requirement of the Proof of delivery  to 
demonstrate if the shipping address matches Mr S requested delivery address.
Based on this, I cant fairly agree that PayPal have refused Mr S claim in line with their User 
Agreement. I say this because shipment tracking information doesnt meet all the 
requirements of Proof of delivery.
As such, PayPal should provide Mr S with a full refund of £1,250. They should also add 8% 
simple interest per annum from the date of purchase (16 March 2021) to the date of 
settlement.
Mr S has received poor service from PayPal. He went to reasonable efforts to show PayPal 
he didnt receive the item  he forwarded the message from the seller, contacted the post 
office to track the item and provided PayPal the denial of receipt number.
PayPal said they dont accept messages from the online marketplace platform and only 
consider evidence provided when they were investigating the case.
But when Mr S contacted PayPal, he believed he would be receiving a refund as confirmed 
by the seller  so it isnt surprising he didnt provide supporting evidence at the outset.
I dont think its reasonable for PayPal to ignore additional information simply because Mr S 
didnt provide it when they were investigating the case. PayPal Buyer Protection explains:
PayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of 
the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time 
of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making 
process.
And as per the User Agreement, I think PayPal shouldve investigated the additional 
information provided by Mr S. I can understand why Mr S felt let down by PayPal. Taking into account the impact on Mr S, I think PayPal should pay £100 compensation in 
recognition of the distress and inconvenience he experienced.  
Putting things right
PayPal should:
Refund £1,250 for the item Mr S didnt receive;
Add 8% simple interest* per annum to the refund from 16 March 2021 until the date 
of settlement;
Pay £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr S.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest. PayPal must give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, my final decision is that I uphold Mr S complaint and require 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2022.
