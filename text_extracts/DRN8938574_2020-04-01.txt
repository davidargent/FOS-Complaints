Mr H is unhappy with the valuation figure Barclays Bank UK PLC used when he applied for a 
new preferential interest rate in July 2018. He says the figure  was wrong,  which meant he 
was only eligible for a higher interest  rate due to the loan to value (LTV) of his mortgage.
background 
Mr H bought the property in September  2016 for £1,225,000. When he was looking to obtain  
a new interest rate for the main tranche of his mortgage in July 2018 Barclays  internal 
property valuation tool returned a figure of £1,249,159. This meant the mortgage was over 
75% LTV and therefore Mr H wasnt eligible for the 1.58%  fixed rate hed selected;  instead 
the rate was fixed  at 1.85%. Mr H was unhappy  with this, but Barclays said he could only 
appeal if hed made material improvements to the property.  Mr H says he had to accept the 
rate as he couldnt  remortgage elsewhere due to the fact his income had dropped.
In March 2019 Mr H was arranging a new rate for another part of his mortgage as that 
preferential rate was due to end in May 2019.  This time the tool gave a valuation  of about 
£1,300,000 which, combined  with the fact the mortgage balance was now lower due to the 
regular monthly payments, meant  he was now under 75% LTV so could select  a better rate.
Mr H complained to Barclays as he felt this proved  the 2018 valuation was incorrect.  He said 
he wanted the lower  rate on the main tranche of the mortgage, or to be paid a lump sum 
equivalent to the amount of extra interest  hed pay over the fixed  rate period. Barclays 
rejected his complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Barclays had done anything wrong. Mr H didnt agree  and so the 
matter has been  passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H said in response to our investigators  view The Barclays valuation in 2018  was 
incorrect and you've not addressed this point. My complaint still stands. And I spoke to a 
mortgage specialist  at the FCA and their view was this should  be a resolved in favour of the 
consumer ie me.
A mortgage specialist  at the FCA  doesnt  deal with individual consumer disputes such  as 
this, nor would  they have  had access to all the information they would need to reach a 
reasoned view. So the opinion Mr H has told us they expressed  has no bearing on my 
decision as an ombudsman at the Financial Ombudsman Service.
Mr H telling us the Barclays valuation was incorrect doesnt make that a fact. As our 
adjudicator explained, Barclays relies on different sources of information to obtain a 
valuation figure, and property prices  can increase  or decrease. In his complaint form Mr H 
wrote This  was despite the fact I offered to evidence the correct valuation via multiple estate 
agent valuations  (with  valuations  of GBP1.4-1.6mio), local property  sales in the area and the 
Nationwide house  price index.
Ref: DRN89385742Lenders generally dont  accept estate agent  valuations as comparables,  as these often 
come in higher  than the true value of the property. The thing that matters is the price 
properties sold for, not what an estate agent would market it at (or tells a potential  customer 
its worth). And Barclays internal tool takes into account the prices  properties have actually 
sold for, as well as what other  properties have been valued at by qualified  surveyors.
Mr H has also said the Nationwide house  price index supported  his thought  that the 
valuation was wrong, but I can only assume hes input the data incorrectly  as it, in fact, 
shows the opposite.
Looking at Mr Hs original  purchase price of £1,225,000 paid in September 2016  (so that is 
Q3 2016) a property  in Greater London  would only have been worth  £1,209,022  in Q3 2018 
according to the Nationwide House  Price Index.
And using  the higher figure of £1,300,000 that the property was valued at for Mr Hs 2017 
further advance  application (so that was Q2 2017), the Nationwide House Price Index 
calculator gives a figure of £1,273,903 in Q3 2018.
Using Mr Hs outstanding  mortgage amount of £1,012,646 (as recorded on the July 2018 
application) then the best possible LTV the Nationwide House  Price  Index gives him for 
Q3 2018 is 79% LTV.  As the product had the bandings of 60% to 75% LTV (which was the 
1.58% fixed rate) and then 75% to 85% LTV (which  was the 1.85% fixed  rate), this means  
Mr H was entitled to the same rate he was offered if Barclays had based its valuation on the 
Nationwide House Price  Index (that is the one for mortgages between  75% LTV and 85% 
LTV). There was no separate 80% banding.
House prices can vary month-on-month,  and just because Mr Hs property was worth  more 
in March 2019, doesnt mean Barclays used the wrong figure in July 2018.  The figure 
Barclays used is based on a number of factors, and the tool is similar to that used by many 
mainstream mortgage lenders. It would be inappropriate for me to interfere with how 
Barclays chooses to do business. Having considered  everything  Im satisfied Barclays  didnt 
make a mistake, and so I make no order or award.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means Ill not be engaging in any further consideration or discussion of the 
merits of it. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr H 
to accept or reject my decision before 1 May 2020.
