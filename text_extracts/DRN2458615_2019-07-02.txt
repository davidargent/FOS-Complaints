K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that National  Westminster  Bank Plc gave them  incorrect  information 
about the amount it would lend if they ported their mortgage. They say, as a result,  they had 
to take out a mortgage with another lender. They paid an early  repayment charge (ERC) and 
other costs. Mr and Mrs G ask that NatWest  pays compensation for their costs and their 
stress and inconvenience.
background
Mr and Mrs G had a mortgage  with NatWest. They wanted to move house and port their 
mortgage. They asked  NatWest for an agreement in principle  (AIP). But when the full 
mortgage application was completed, NatWest said it would lend less than it had indicated in 
the AIP. Mr and Mrs G applied to another lender. They had to pay an ERC  to NatWest and 
other fees related to changing lender.  NatWest accepted it made  an error with the AIP. It 
offered £400 compensation,  which Mr and Mrs G say isnt enough.  
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld, saying:
an AIP isnt a guarantee of the amount  a bank will lend. NatWest was entitled  to decide 
how much  it would  lend after the completing the application process.
NatWest had made an error when it issued the AIP. But if it had told Mr and Mrs G at the 
outset that it wouldnt  lend the full amount theyd have  applied  elsewhere and would still 
have incurred the ERC  and other  charges. While Mr and Mrs G said theyd have looked 
for a less expensive  property, they still went ahead with the purchase after they knew  
theyd need to apply to another  lender.  
NatWest accepts it made errors and offered £400 compensation for the upset caused. 
The investigator said this was reasonable.
Mr and Mrs G didnt agree. They said they understood the AIP is only an indication but there 
shouldnt have been such a big difference (about £30,000) in what  NatWest said it would 
lend. And the monthly repayments  were  within their budget and about the same as they are 
now paying. They said they were forced to change lenders  and incur  costs.
Mr and Mrs G said NatWest didnt follow its complaints process  properly: the mortgage 
adviser didnt log the complaint and they werent  given an opportunity  to explain that the 
compensation offered didnt cover the stress, inconvenience and additional costs  that they 
endured. Mr and Mrs G said they didnt feel listened  to about the upset caused by NatWests 
errors. They also said that the AIP wasnt much different from the one NatWest provided  
three years before  even  though their income had increased.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Ref: DRN24586152Under Mr and Mrs Gs mortgage with NatWest an ERC was payable if the mortgage was 
repaid during the fixed rate period. The ERC  didnt  apply  if the mortgage  was ported to 
another property.  Mr and Mrs G wanted  to port their mortgage and asked NatWest for an 
AIP.
Theres no dispute here that NatWest made  an error.  It didnt correctly  assess the 
information Mr and Mrs G provided.  It issued an AIP which indicated it would lend a higher  
amount than if it had assessed the information correctly.
After completing the application process, NatWest  offered to lend less than the amount  
Mr and Mrs G needed  for the property  they wanted  to buy. Mr and Mrs G say the monthly 
payments would have  been within their budget and similar to the payments theyre now 
making. But NatWest is entitled to make a decision about the amount it will lend using its 
current lending criteria.  I cant reasonably say NatWest should have offered to lend more to 
Mr and Mrs G.
Mr and Mrs G applied for a mortgage  elsewhere.  As Mr and Mrs G repaid the mortgage 
during the period that the ERC applied, I think NatWest was entitled to apply the ERC.  In 
some circumstances, it might be fair to require NatWest to refund the ERC. I dont think 
thats the case here. 
NatWest made an error when it issued the AIP. I understand  the point made by Mr and 
Mrs G about the size of the difference between the amount in the AIP and the amount 
NatWest agreed to lend.  They had no reason to think the AIP was wrong. But I must  also 
take into account that Mr and Mrs G knew the AIP was an indication of the amount NatWest  
would lend and it might lend less than this. They received the AIP in mid February 2019 and 
were told that NatWest would lend less than this on 2 March  2019  about  two weeks later. 
At this point, Mr and Mrs G could choose  whether  to continue  with the purchase and apply to 
another lender or look for another property so they could port their NatWest mortgage.
Mr and Mrs G chose to continue  with their purchase. They  took mortgage advice and applied  
to another lender. They paid fees to the adviser and the new lender. I dont think its 
reasonable to require  NatWest to pay compensation for these costs. Mr and Mrs G knew  
theyd incur these costs if they applied to a different lender.  
Ive no doubt though  that NatWests error caused  Mr and Mrs G disappointment  and 
inconvenience. Mr and Mrs G were starting  the process of moving home when they found  
out about NatWests  error. They had to make  a decision about whether to apply to another 
lender or look for another property and stay with NatWest. I think  its right that NatWest pays 
compensation. Ive considered what Mr and Mrs G have said about the effect of NatWests 
error. But I think, in the circumstances, £400  compensation is fair and reasonable.
Mr and Mrs G raised concerns about NatWests complaint handling  process. As our 
investigator explained, we cant look into this as complaint handling isnt a regulated activity.
Ref: DRN24586153my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint as I find the compensation offered by 
National Westminster Bank Plc is fair and reasonable  in the circumstances.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision  before  2 August  2019.
