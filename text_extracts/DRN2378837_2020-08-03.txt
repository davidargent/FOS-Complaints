K821x#15complaint and background
Mr T complains that Naylors Finance Limited lent to him irresponsibly. Mr T is represented  
by another person. 
I issued a provisional decision on 24 July 2020 and I am pleased  to say that both Mr T 
(through his representative) and Naylors have replied quickly to say that they accept it.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As both parties have  accepted the provisional  findings I issued  earlier this month then I see 
no reason to depart from those findings  they are set out in the attached  provisional  
decision and form part of this final decision.
putting things right  what I am asking Naylors to do
I uphold Mr Ts complaint in relation to Loans 5 to 8 and Naylors has conceded in relation to 
loans 9 onwards.  So, for neatness I have combined it all into this one redress section: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on Loans 5 to 17; and
pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; and
the number  of loans taken from Loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  Loans 5 to 17 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file; and
I award a payment  to Mr T for distress and inconvenience of £600.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Naylors  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ts complaint in part and direct that Naylors Finance 
Limited do as I have outlined above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, 
Im required  to ask Mr T to accept or reject my decision  before 3 September  2020.

background
Initially it was thought that Mr T had 12 loans with Naylors. Mr T was able to demonstrate that he had 
more. Our lead adjudicator  reconstructed  the loan history using information  from Mr T and Naylors.  I 
have discovered a further loan on one of Mr Ts credit files and so I have marked it as 2A. I will refer 
to the loans  using the numbers in this new loan table.  The end dates  of loans  1 to 4 vary depending  
on the credit  file used to check them and Naylors may have the accurate  details: this table is an 
overall view only.

One of our adjudicators  thought that Loans 4 to 12 in the first loan table numbering (now  loans 9 to 
17) should be the ones that Naylors put right for Mr T. Naylors responded  in detail and made many 
points. It conceded in relation to Loans 4 and 5 in the first loan table  numbering (now  loans 9 and 10). 
The complaint was passed to our lead adjudicator  who responded in detail to Naylors points and 
came to the same view as our first adjudicator. Naylors wrote to say that it accepted it and was 
prepared to pay the recommended redress. 
Mr Ts representative pointed out that Mr T had more  loans on his credit file than listed on the first 
loan table, and so he wanted us to consider the complaint about  all the loans. 
Having obtained  the additional information  from Mr T and his representative, our lead adjudicator 
reassessed the complaint  as more loans  had been approved for Mr T than had been  represented on 
the first loan table. Our lead adjudicators view on jurisdiction  and on the merits of the complaint was 
that Naylors should put things right for Loans 5 to 17. Naylors disagreed about the earlier  loans and 
our lead adjudicator wrote again to address the jurisdiction of us being  able to look at those earlier 
loans. 
Ref: DRN23788373Naylors has received our lead adjudicators views on the jurisdiction surrounding the earlier loans  and 
after objecting to it, no further has been said about that. So, I have not dealt with the jurisdiction 
element of this complaint  I have looked at the merits. 
In relation to the merits of the complaint the complaint was passed to me for a decision. As Naylors 
has conceded  in relation to Loans 9 to 17 on the new loan table numbering  then I do not plan to 
review those. 
I will be looking  at Loans 1 to 8 and an aspect of the complaint which I do not think has been 
addressed so far: the distress and inconvenience caused by the lending in view of the health issues 
Mr T has raised. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Our website sets out what we typically think  about  deciding whether 
a lenders checks were  proportionate - including  all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry 
practice. 
Naylors needed to take reasonable  steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out reasonable checks to understand whether  Mr T could repay his 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  consider a number  of different  things, such  as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. In 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of how much 
information it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early stages  of a lending 
relationship. 
But we might think it needed  to do more  if, for example,  the consumers income  was low or the 
amount lent was high. And the longer  the lending  relationship goes on, the greater the risk of it 
becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So, wed expect a lender to 
be able to show that it hasnt  continued to provide these loans to a customer irresponsibly. There  may 
even come a point where the lending  history and pattern  of lending itself clearly demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments  being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow 
this is the case. The industry regulator (applicable at the time of the lending decision) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable  commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably  to realise, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.  Ive provisionally decided to uphold Mr Ts complaint in part 
and award  some distress  and inconvenience payment to Mr T, and I have explained why below.
I have been sent a comprehensive set of documents by Mr T and his representative, including signed 
statements by Mr T, his friend, his father; bank statements dating back  to July 2012; medical 
information and two different  personal credit files. The signed statements and medical  information 
form have  been sent to Naylors by Mr Ts representative as part of the complaint and so it is aware  of 
their content.
Ref: DRN23788374Mr Ts complaint letter  to Naylors was dated 29 October 2018. Normally Id expect that records to 
cover all the lending is sent to us, but I have  no documentation  going  back  beyond June 2015. I am 
not entirely sure why that is the case but as this is a provisional decision Naylors has the opportunity, 
again, to provide more. And I have proceeded on the current  evidence I have to date which for the 
earlier loans is very little from Naylors. 
Naylors final response letter to Mr T dated 13 November  2018 was not compliant with the rules 
surrounding what a formal final response letter (FRL) should contain and it had no referral  rights to 
this service. 
Naylors points in that FRL are summarised  here:
Naylors accepts that Mr Ts payments  used to be erratic;
it was fully aware of Mr Ts fathers intervention clearing Mr Ts debts with Naylors;
it was aware that Mr Ts father  had asked that he (Mr T) was not to be contacted  again;
Naylors explained that it was Mr T who kept asking the agent  for a further  loan and despite Mr 
Ts fathers wishes a small loan of £100 was issued  to him;
the income and expenditure forms were signed by Mr T;
Mr T never  mentioned  other loan companies;
the agent  never saw any of the ill health points Mr T has raised  as part of his complaint.
When this service did start to investigate the complaint, Naylors sent to us a limited number  of 
documents. It gave us several  explanations of its practices and approach to its lending, and I have 
read the collection  agents views and seen copies of the texts passing between  Mr T and that agent.  I 
have no documentation from Naylors  about  these  loans  prior to June 2015. The only evidence of any 
income and expenditure  forms  being  completed are two in 2015, two forms in 2017, and two in 2018.  
Each one notes that Mr Ts employment status was employment benefits or benefits.  
Naylors wrote two longer letters to this service and rather than summarise all the points, I wish to 
assure the parties I have read them and noted their content and tone. And they both refer to the re-
lending after Mr Ts father had asked the company to cease. I have read the agents views  and points  
and read the texts which passed between them. 
Together its clear that Naylors accepts  that it lent to Mr T against Mr Ts fathers wishes twice: in late 
2015/early 2016 and again in March 2017. This dovetails with the Loan Table  set out above which  
does demonstrate  that there was a gap of about four months  from August  2015 to December 
2015/early 2016 and a larger gap later in 2016 until March 2017.  As these dates fall into the loan 
period which have  been  conceded by Naylors then I say no more  about  these in relation to the merits. 
But these factors have all had a bearing on my provisional decision  in relation to the distress and 
inconvenience award which I come  to later.  
For Loans  1 to 3 I think that Naylors ought to have  had the basic information about Mr Ts income,  
regular expenditure and regular other credit commitments. The bank statements I have from Mr T go 
back to July 2012  and Loans 1 to 3 pre-date  these.  And Naylors  is correct that it was not incumbent 
upon it to carry out credit searches. I have no information about what  Mr T put on his application 
forms or informed  Naylors about his income and expenditure  during those years. So, I have not been 
able to come  to any conclusions.  
However, by the time that Mr T applied for Loan  4 on the Loan Table in July 2012, then I think that 
additional checks ought to have  been carried  out. By that time Mr T had four other loans open and at 
least two of them  ought to have been  repaid by July 2012 and had not been. Naylors has said that its 
agents carried  out the affordability and creditworthiness assessments in the customers home and its 
agents review original  copies of pertinent information such as payslips and bank statements  when 
undertaking an assessment. 
And Naylors has referred to its overall approach described by Naylors as we operate  as a provider of 
fair and sustainable finance to customers that are refused finance from other mainstream providers.  I 
am aware that the agent knew Mr T, and had done for many  years and even if the agent in 2012 was 
Ref: DRN23788375a different one to the one who has submitted her views to Naylors (which have  been forwarded  to us), 
then that approach is one of the points Naylors has asked that we take into account.  Naylors has told 
me that its agents are aware that they are dealing  with people who may not be able to obtain 
mainstream credit  and so it knew  the market in which it was offering credit and that must  have had a 
bearing on the creditworthiness assessments it says it carried out. These are meant to be from a 
borrowers perspective and not based  on a business  risk approach. 
In relation to Mr Ts complaint, I think that for Mr Ts fifth loan application more  ought  to have been 
carried out. And accessibility to papers, details  of his home life, Mr Ts bank statements, knowledge of 
his employment or lack of it, were all available  to be assessed. Naylors has said that these aspects of 
an individuals life are relevant to its assessments and the approach  it took when in their customers  
homes. 
Having said all that, and being fair to both parties, the bank statements I have and the personal credit 
files I have  do not go back in time far enough  for me to assess the month leading up to the loan 
approval in early July 2012. So, on the current evidence  I am not able to assess  Mr Ts income,  
outgoings and his other credit  commitments  for Loan 4. 
I do see that another loan (Loan 5) was approved  for Mr T a few days later and that led to Mr T having  
five loans  open. Loan 5 would  have  been  the sixth for which hed have to pay and that would  have led 
to him having a monthly debt to repay to Naylors of around £144.  For a person on benefits  I do not 
think that is a small sum.
 
And this leads me to the next element I have considered which is the repetitive nature of the loans 
being approved for Mr T. I ve looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history  with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Naylors should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Naylors ought to have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. Given the circumstances  of Mr Ts case, I think  that this point was reached 
by Loan 5. I say this because: 
from Loan  5 onwards Mr T was provided with a new loan within days/ or weeks of settling a 
previous one. So Naylors ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr T was having  
to borrow further and that he was not able to repay sustainably;
by Loan 5 Naylors  had been lending to Mr T for 17 months and as I said in the last section, 
Loan 5 was days  after Loan 4;
the loans were  taking longer than scheduled to repay  which  shows that he was likely not 
coping with the repayments;
and between  loans 6 and 7 Naylors lent to Mr T despite knowing much more  information  
about Mr Ts financial and personal circumstances  than it may have known before, as I am 
satisfied on the evidence I have seen that it had been  informed of these elements  by Mr Ts 
father in or around the summer of 2015;  
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Naylors. Often the loans  
overlapped with each other and Loan 17 was taken out several years after Mr Ts first loan. 
The effect  was that Mr T had to service  several debts over an extended period.
I think  that Mr T lost out because  Naylors  continued  to provide borrowing  from loan 5 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ts indebtedness  by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period; and
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these loans.
So, I am planning  to uphold the complaint about Loans 5 onwards (Loans 9 to 17 having been 
conceded by Naylors)  and Naylors should put things right.
Ref: DRN23788376the distress and inconvenience stemming  from Ts health  issues
My provisional  decision  is that I have seen enough evidence to award Mr T £600 to compensate him 
because of how Naylors  treated Mr T as a customer. Mr Ts father  has explained, and Naylors has 
accepted, that he paid off his sons debts twice. Mr Ts father says that the same lenders who were  
told 3 times by me not to lend to him because he is mentally unwell had again  flouted  my wishes and 
lent to him again! 
Naylors has not disputed that it knew of this. Naylors justification  for lending again, seems to be 
based on Mr Ts constant requests to Naylors, and that a full assessment was carried out concluding 
that he could afford a small loan of £100. I find this remarkable bearing in mind all the evidence I have 
read. 
The very harm  Mr Ts father was trying to avoid was to ensure that Mr T did not obtain more  loans and 
for a number of reasons: that he appeared to have been getting the loans to fuel his behaviour; and 
the debts were adding to the distress  and the mental health concerns  clearly explained  to me in the 
medical form; that the financial issues were apparent in that he had multiple loans with several 
lenders and generally this needed to stop.  
So, I think that the reason  for informing  Naylors, twice, that the lending had to stop was ignored, 
twice, and I am not persuaded by Naylors explanations that the lending was justified. I am satisfied 
that it likely  caused harm  to Mr T, and likely exacerbated an existing condition  by making him more  in 
debt and so I do think that the lending  caused harm and distress. Mr Ts fathers multiple interventions 
demonstrates a supportive family and so not lending  to Mr T would  not likely have  led him to be 
destitute. I say this because I have seen that Mr Ts family have supported him many times, financially 
and emotionally.
