The complaint
Mrs C says National Westminster Bank Plc, has treated her unfairly in relation to a 
transaction on her credit card which paid for flights.
What happened
In November 2021 Mrs C used her NatWest credit card to make payment for flights. She 
bought them through an introducer Ill call Firm C who arranged the connecting outbound 
flights for December 2021 and return flights in January 2022. She paid Â£840 for these flights. 
As the departure date approached there was government guidance introduced regarding the 
pandemic and travelling to the destination country. So Mrs C didnt fly.
Mrs C tried to get her money back from Firm C but was unsuccessful. Firm C pointed to the 
tickets being non-refundable and that the flights had taken place. So she complained to 
NatWest.
NatWest says it considered the matter and having done so it didnt think it needed to refund 
her. It raised a chargeback and pointed to Firm Cs defence of that chargeback, which 
pointed to the non-refundable nature of the tickets and that the flights were supplied. So Mrs 
C, still unsatisfied, brought her complaint to this service.
Our Investigator felt NatWest didnt have to do anymore. And Mrs C remains unhappy and 
so this complaint comes to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs C used her NatWest credit card to pay Firm C for the flights. This means that if certain 
criteria are met NatWest can have certain responsibilities to Mrs C which arise from the 
relevant law, specifically, Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the CCA). In 
summary, in certain circumstances, Section 75 has the effect of allowing Mrs C to hold 
NatWest liable for breaches of contract, or misrepresentations made in relation to the 
agreement made. In essence NatWest can be held responsible for a like claim as Mrs C 
could hold Firm C.
Also Mrs Cs NatWest credit card is part of a card scheme which is operated by another 
company. And this scheme has rules which includes giving NatWest an avenue for card 
transactions to be disputed with Merchants such as Firm C, namely through the Chargeback 
process. This isnt a right for consumers and the ultimate decision maker on such 
chargebacks is the scheme itself and not NatWest. So it is possible that NatWest could take 
the chargeback as far as possible and Mrs C still not be successful.
I should also add at this juncture that this decision is solely about NatWest and whether it did 
what it should have and whether it treated Mrs C fairly. This decision isnt about the airline or 
Firm C, which arent within this Services remit for complaints regarding Chargeback and 
S75. I hope this distinction is clear.
could NatWest challenge the transaction through a Chargeback? 
Mrs C doesnt dispute that she used her NatWest credit card here. Nor does she dispute the 
amount, date, or any other details about the transaction itself. So I dont think NatWest 
couldve challenged the payment on the basis Mrs C didnt properly authorise the 
transaction, given what Ive just set out.
NatWest is required to consider whether there is a reasonable prospect of success when it is 
considering whether to go through the Chargeback process or not. If it does go through the 
process, then it must do so properly. And it can fairly decide to not proceed at any stage if it 
doesnt think there is a reasonable prospect of success.
NatWest did raise a chargeback here and so clearly NatWest did support Mrs Cs position to 
Firm C. Firm Cs defence to the chargeback was that Mrs Cs flights were non-refundable 
and that the flights were provided. Firm C has provided that evidence to NatWest and 
NatWest decided not to take the matter further. 
Ive considered what Firm C provided to NatWest including the evidence around the flights 
taking place. Having considered everything in the round Im satisfied that NatWests decision 
not to continue with the chargeback was fair in the circumstances. Im satisfied the flights 
were non-refundable and that those flight services did take place.
Mrs C points to the government restrictions put in place. But Firm C nor the airline were 
responsible for those. And the responsibility for following such restrictions is on the traveller 
not on Firm C or the airline. And Mrs C could have taken the flights, she just chose not to 
because of the actions shed have had to take regarding testing and quarantine on arrival 
and on return. But the flights did take place and so I dont think it would be fair to make 
NatWest bear that cost because Firm C provided what Mrs C wanted to buy.
So having considered what happened here I think it likely that had NatWest continued with 
its chargeback, it would have been ultimately unsuccessful. So I can see why it considered 
that the chargeback no longer had a reasonable prospect of success when it decided to not 
take the chargeback any further. So I dont think Mrs C has lost out because of what 
NatWest did in regard to chargeback.
Section 75
Before deciding on whether there is breach or misrepresentation here, there are some 
requirements set out in the CCA which also have to be met. However Im not persuaded I 
need to make a finding at this point on these requirements because for other reasons I have 
decided that NatWest doesnt need to do anymore in relation to this complaint. 
For NatWest to be held accountable under a like claim under s75 it has to be shown that 
the supplier either breached the contract or materially misrepresented something to Mrs C 
which was untrue and that led to loss.
Ive already established that the flights took place. Hence it is clear there is no breach of 
contract as Firm C booked the flights as instructed and they were available and took place. 
Furthermore Im satisfied they were non-refundable so refund would be due when Mrs C 
chose not to fly. And so its clear that Firm C didnt breach the contract Mrs C had with it as it 
supplied the tickets and wasnt responsible for the restrictions put in place. And Ive seen no 
persuasive evidence of Mrs C being told by Firm C something that was untrue which she reasonably relied upon and which then led to her loss. So without any misrepresentation or 
breach of contract here by Firm C, NatWest cannot be held to a like claim and thus doesnt 
have to refund Mrs C. 
It would be unfair on NatWest to have to pay out in these circumstances as it doesnt have 
responsibility for the restrictions in place because neither did Firm C. I appreciate the 
reasons why Mrs C chose not to travel but the service was provided and she could have 
travelled. So I dont see a reason for NatWest to pay for this.
Mrs C also points to comments made by Firm C with regard to her flights being exchanged. I 
can see our Investigator asked Mrs C about this, but I dont think it makes a difference. I can 
see the booking system details Firm C has supplied in its defence to NatWest. Here it logs 
Mrs Cs flights as being exchanged/reissued. And it says as a result of this it doesnt have 
to do more. Mrs C says she cancelled and then rebooked and later travelled to the same 
destination. It is not clear whether this code means Mrs C exchanged her tickets from the 
first booking to her second booking. Or whether it means after Mrs C cancelled, these tickets 
were reissued to someone else. But either way it doesnt make a difference to NatWests 
position because whether or not Mrs C travelled doesnt make a difference to whether 
NatWest has to refund her because in either event its not liable due to the non-refund nature 
of the tickets and those flights going ahead.
So all in all having considered everything Im satisfied Mrs C bought non-refundable tickets 
and didnt fly as planned. I satisfied that the flights were available. And Im not persuaded 
that NatWest should make any refund here.
I appreciate the reasons regarding the pandemic which meant Mrs C chose not to fly. And I 
can certainly understand her wish to be prudent in light of the pandemic and her health. But 
that doesnt make it fair for NatWest to have to cover the costs of these tickets which she 
bought on a non-refundable basis. Mrs C hasnt persuasively demonstrated what NatWest 
did wrong or indeed explained how it treated her unfairly. And it would only be fair to make 
NatWest pay if it had treated Mrs C unfairly. But I dont think it has treated her unfairly in 
terms of either its approach to chargeback or section 75. So accordingly Mrs Cs complaint 
does not succeed.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I do not uphold this complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc. It has nothing further to do in respect of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 April 2023.
