The complaint
Mr and Mrs H are unhappy that, after they took out a five-year fixed-rate mortgage product,  
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined their application to port (transfer) their 
mortgage onto a new property. 
To settle the complaint, Mr and Mrs H want NatWest to switch them onto a two-year product 
and allow them to take out additional borrowing, or move them to a standard variable rate 
(SVR) and waive any early repayment charge (ERC) on their five-year product.
What happened
Mr and Mrs H have a mortgage with NatWest, originally taken out in 2008. In April 2017 they 
switched to a new two-year fixed-rate mortgage interest product.
In July 2018 Mr and Mrs H spoke to NatWest about porting. The bank explained how porting 
works, and that this would be subject to a new application and meeting NatWests lending 
criteria.
In October 2018 Mr and Mrs H contacted NatWest again about further borrowing. At this 
point they completed a mortgage toolkit.   Mr and Mrs H provided NatWest with information 
about their requirements and circumstances so that NatWest could see how much it would 
lend. Mr and Mrs H mentioned past credit defaults and NatWest wasnt able to complete the 
assessment. Mr and Mrs H said theyd wait until the defaults dropped off their credit files 
before reapplying.
In May 2019 NatWest confirmed to Mr and Mrs H that their current interest rate product was 
due to end on 31 August 2019. Mr and Mrs H looked at a new two-year fixed rate product 
which was due to end on 31 October 2021.
But on 29 July 2019 Mr and Mrs H applied online, without speaking to NatWest, for a new 
interest rate. They selected a product which was on a five-year fixed rate of interest of 2.53% 
until 31 October 2024.
The mortgage was subject to an ERC on a tapering basis  5% if repaid in full or in part 
(outside of permitted overpayments) within the first year, 4% in year two, 3% in year three, 
2% in year four and 1% in the fifth year of the fixed rate product. 
The mortgage offer also explained that, during the period when the ERC applied, there was 
the possibility of moving the mortgage interest rate product  to a mortgage secured on a new 
property, subject to meeting various conditions and NatWests lending criteria. If those 
conditions and criteria were met, the ERC paid on closing the existing mortgage account 
would be reimbursed.
In August 2019 Mr and Mrs H wanted to port the mortgage product onto a new property, and 
borrow additional funds. Unfortunately this failed NatWests credit scoring and so the request 
was declined. This was queried by Mr and Mrs H in September 2019. They thought that 
NatWest might have been using incorrect information. But after looking at Mr and Mrs Hs 
credit scores, NatWest was unable to agree to a request to port the mortgage product with 
additional borrowing.
Mr and Mrs H complained. They say they discussed porting with NatWest and had been led 
to believe they could do this. Mr and Mrs H say they would never have locked themselves 
into a five-year product with an ERC if theyd known their request to port the mortgage and 
borrow extra funds would be declined. They say that, instead, theyd have taken out a two-
year product.
NatWest acknowledged that Mr and Mrs H should have been told, after they mentioned past 
credit difficulties, that markers on their credit file would affect any application for future 
borrowing. NatWest paid compensation of £350 for this, as at the time it couldnt locate the 
records of the calls. 
But after listening to the calls, NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong. The bank 
said that its staff had explained how porting worked. The bank said that the choice to switch 
to a five-year rate was done by Mr and Mrs H without discussing it with NatWest. In the 
circumstances, the bank didnt think it was at fault.
Dissatisfied with NatWests response, Mr and Mrs H complained to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service. An investigator looked at the complaint but didnt think NatWest had 
done anything wrong. He explained that NatWest hadnt given any advice to Mr and Mrs H 
when they opted for a five-year fixed rate in July 2019, as theyd chosen this themselves 
online. The investigator also explained that t, where the application had failed the banks 
lending criteria, NatWest was entitled to decline it.
Mr and Mrs H didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint. They say 
(and I summarise) that, before choosing the five-year fixed rate option, theyd had several 
conversations with NatWest discussing their plans to move and borrow extra funds. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I confirm Ive read everything provided by Mr and Mrs H and NatWest, and Ive listened to 
the available call recordings.
Its not disputed that, several times before they chose their new five-year fixed-rate product 
in July 2019, Mr and Mrs H had had conversations about porting with NatWest, and had 
gone through the NatWest toolkit (in October 2018) when they were told they would not at 
that time qualify for additional borrowing.
Initially NatWest said that the staff Mr and Mrs H spoke to should have explained more 
clearly about how markers on their credit histories might affect future borrowing. As NatWest 
hadnt been able to locate the calls, it paid £350 compensation. But NatWest located the 
calls and I have listened to these.
Im satisfied that, after October 2018, when Mr and Mrs Hs assessment using the toolkit 
failed, there is no record of any later discussions with NatWest about borrowing more money 
until after the five-year product completed in July 2019. In August and September 2019 two 
further toolkit assessments were completed, but both failed.
Mr and Mrs H say that they only opted for the five-year fixed rate because they were told 
they could port this. But the banks record show that the application for the two-year fixed-
rate product lapsed in July 2019, after which the five-year product was applied for.I appreciate it was disappointing for Mr and Mrs H to find they couldnt borrow any more 
money so that they could move. No formal application was made, because Mr and Mrs H 
didnt pass the initial assessment via the toolkit.  I note Mrs H has acknowledged that there 
were issues with her credit file which needed to be improved and so Im not persuaded that 
Mr and Mrs H were assured by NatWest that any application for future borrowing would be 
approved.
NatWest, like all lenders, users various criteria when deciding whether or not to lend, both at 
an initial assessment stage or for a full application. Credit markers are just one aspect, but 
Im afraid I cant ask NatWest to disclose what other factors it might take into account, as this 
is information which is commercially sensitive.
Having considered the available evidence, Im not persuaded that NatWest led Mr and Mrs H 
to believe it would allow them to borrow additional funds if they ported their mortgage 
product. The bank always made Mr and Mrs H aware that this was subject to them meeting 
lending criteria.
In the circumstances, Im unable to find that there is any basis upon which NatWest should 
allow Mr and Mrs H to exit the five-year fixed-rate product without paying the ERC.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means that we are unable to consider the complaint any further, nor enter into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
