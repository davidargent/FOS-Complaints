K820x#14complaint
Mr S, on behalf of Business A, complains about  how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal) has dealt with an account  Business  A holds with it. Mr S says PayPal has acted 
unfairly, and without his authorisation, in requiring  Business  A to keep a minimum cash  
balance (a reserve) of £13,000  in its account.  He also says it has acted unfairly by refusing 
to lend Business  A money through its Working Capital facility, when it has provided such 
lending on many previous  occasions.  Mr S is also unhappy with how PayPal has 
communicated its decision  he does  not feel it has offered sufficient reasons for making the 
decision, and feels it misled him about  providing  further lending  through  its Working  Capital 
facility. And he mentions  that an email  sent to him by PayPal contained someone elses  
name. 
background
Business A has a PayPal account.  In early 2018 Mr S, on behalf of Business A, entered  into 
discussion with PayPal  about upgrading the account, to include credit card services. During 
the course of this discussion Business  A provided  some details of its finances  and business  
to PayPal. After PayPal received this information it took the decision to place a reserve of 
£13,000 on Business As account. It said it did this to protect  it in the event of chargebacks,  
claims, payment  reversals and refunds.  
At the time of the reserve being placed  on Business As account it was using PayPals  
Working Capital facility. The Working Capital facility allows  a business, for a fee, to receive  
an advance payment from PayPal, based on its anticipated future PayPal sales.  
PayPal agreed to consider allowing Business A to use the Working  Capital facility again in 
June 2018, and confirmed this in an email. It offered to temporarily lift the reserve, to allow 
an application to use the Working Capital  facility to be made. After further consideration 
PayPal did not however  ultimately agree to offer any further advances  to Business A, and 
the £13,000 reserve remained in place. 
PayPal has recently reviewed its decision to maintain  a reserve on Business As account, 
and decided it should remain in place. It gave  four reasons when making  this decision, 
referring to the financial circumstances of Business A, and its view that the business 
Business A was engaged  in was high risk. 
Our investigator looked into things and concluded Business As complaint should not be 
upheld. She said, in summary: 
She appreciated that Mr S was unhappy  that PayPal initially  advised him that 
Business A could  apply for the Working Capital  facility  but then decided  against this. 
However, the terms of PayPals  offer were not met. She acknowledged  that Mr S 
made payments  to pay off the existing capital advance, but PayPal was entitled to 
carry out a further review of the account  and make the decision  not to pay any further  
advance. 
PayPal had apologised  to Mr S for sending an email addressed to a different name.  It 
had confirmed that necessary corrective action had been taken to prevent this from 
happening again. She thought  this was reasonable.
Ref: DRN56996092Shed  considered what PayPal reviewed to come to its decisions. Looking  at the 
specific factors that PayPal took account  of, she did not accept that it had been  unfair  
in its decisions  or that its decisions were based  on wrong information. 
She hadnt seen  any reason why PayPal  was not entitled to apply the reserve on the 
account. This was ultimately at PayPals discretion and the terms of the account 
allowed for it. 
Mr S, on behalf of Business A, did not accept this view. He said, in summary:  
PayPal has acted  in an unjustified way, which began when it first pressed Business A 
for its credit card business. Business A was asked  to provide financial statements 
which went beyond what was needed to qualify to use PayPals credit card service. 
He was then told PayPal would put a 25% hold on all credit  card payments, at which 
point he cancelled the application  for the credit  card service. He was told this 
wouldnt impact Business As relationship  with PayPal,  but then the reserve  was 
applied. This was simply PayPal getting back at Business A for not giving it the credit 
card business. 
There has never been a problem with Business As account, and will not be in the 
future. It has traded for nine years without problems. 
PayPal has not compromised and agreed to put a smaller reserve  in place, which  
would be less of a problem for Business A. 
His previous conduct  having borrowed over 20 times using the Working Capital 
facility  has not been taken into account. 
It was agreed that once Business  A paid back the cash it had been advanced under 
the Working Capital facility it would be able to use this facility again.  On this basis,  
Business A agreed to buy stock.  But PayPal would not then allow  him further 
advances. 
Our investigator was not minded to change her view. Mr S remained unhappy, and pointed 
out that PayPal  had denied the existence  of member of staff hed dealt with in relation to 
upgrading his account, to use its credit card service. He said this showed PayPal had been 
deceitful. As an agreement could not be reached, the complaint has been  referred  to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know this is something of great importance  to Mr S and Business  A. And I do recognise the 
impact PayPals decisions have  had on them. But I do not think it would be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances to ask PayPal to do anything  else.  In my view, PayPal has 
made legitimate commercial decisions,  based  on its view of the risks associated  with 
Business As account. I do not think  it has acted  unreasonably or unfairly in making those 
decisions or when  enacting them. And I do not think it has done anything  significantly wrong  
otherwise. I appreciate that Mr S will be disappointed I have taken this view. I have set out 
below my reasons  for reaching it. 
Ref: DRN56996093I am satisfied that the terms associated with Business  As account allowed it to require a 
reserve to be held in Business As account, at its discretion (i.e. without the need  for Mr Ss 
authorisation) if it reasonably believed the account posed a level of risk which was not 
acceptable to it. Those  terms say:
10.4 Reserves. PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place  a Reserve on funds held in your 
Account when PayPal  reasonably believes (based on the information available  to PayPal at 
the time of taking  the Reserve  and what in its sole discretion it regards as an acceptable 
level of risk to PayPal under all the circumstances)  there may be a higher than acceptable 
level of risk associated with your Account. 
I am also satisfied that PayPal was under no obligation to offer the Working Capital facility  
that was a commercial  decision for it to make, based on what  it knew about Business A at 
the time of each  application. 
So PayPal was entitled to apply a reserve, if it reasonably believed there was a higher risk 
than it was prepared  to accept associated with Business As account, and was not obliged  to 
offer the Working Capital facility. And, whilst I appreciate Mr S is very unhappy with the 
decisions PayPal has made, I do not think PayPal has made its decisions to apply the 
reserve and not offer the Working Capital  facility arbitrarily or as a penal  measure,  because  
Business A did not agree to upgrade its account.  
I can see PayPal requested details of Business  As finances and how it operated  before it 
applied the reserve.  So it did have regard to information about Business A when making  its 
decision. Those details  might initially have been requested  as part of the discussions  about 
an account upgrade,  rather than specifically  with a view to considering whether it should 
apply a reserve to Business  As account.  But if PayPal took the view, having seen the 
details, that there was a reasonable basis for it to conclude  Business As account posed an 
unacceptable risk to it, it was entitled to rely on the terms associated with the account  to 
place a reserve to mitigate that risk. And I dont think I can fairly say that PayPal did not have 
a reasonable basis  for believing there was a risk. Business As unaudited accounts to March 
2018 show a net profit of around £3,000 from a turnover in excess  of £1m. And it appears  it 
sells hundreds of items of furniture each month through eBay,  with PayPal as the payment 
method. So, although Business As PayPal account had a good track  record, I think  PayPal  
did have a basis for taking  the view there  was a risk that might  not continue. What level of 
risk was posed and whether that level was acceptable were matters  for PayPals legitimate 
commercial judgement. 
I do not think taking  the step of applying the reserve means PayPal was penalising 
Business A, because  it did not upgrade its account, although  I appreciate  that Mr S sees it 
that way. In my view PayPal was taking steps  to protect itself,  having become privy to 
information about Business A which, in its view, meant there  was an unacceptable  risk to it, 
rather than penalising Business A for not taking out a product with it. And, although I 
appreciate Mr S didnt  find the explanation satisfactory,  PayPal did explain why it was putting 
the reserve in place - to protect it in the event of chargebacks, claims,  payment reversals  
and refunds. 
I can see PayPal has also revisited  its decision to apply the reserve, and has asked  for up to 
date details about Business A and its finances  when reconsidering its decision. I note that, in 
its recent response to Mr S, PayPal has also gone  into further detail  by reference to the 
specific circumstances of Business A - as to why it thinks  the reserve should be maintained. 
So its clear  PayPal has taken steps to keep  this under review, has ensured  it has up to date 
Ref: DRN56996094information when  carrying out its review, and has offered Mr S an explanation of why the 
reserve is being maintained. 
PayPal was not obliged to continue  to offer Business A the Working Capital facility.  It seems 
it did not withdraw the facility as soon as it put the reserve on Business As account.  It 
instead allowed  Business A to use it for a period of time (I understand the final advance 
under the Working Capital facility was made in March 2018  it was paid off in September  
2018). PayPal also offered to consider a further application to use its Working Capital facility 
from Business A in June 2018. So it did not immediately withdraw the cash  advance  it had 
given, and did give Business A a further opportunity  to apply, subject to terms that were not 
ultimately met. 
I know Mr S made commitments  to buy stock, following PayPals offer to consider  a further 
application to use its Working Capital facility in June 2018. But I have not seen sufficient 
evidence to show Mr S was led to believe that a further cash  advance under the Working 
Capital facility was guaranteed. The emails from PayPal about this which Mr S has sent to 
us include the following: 
I would like to advise  however, that PayPal Working Capital is not a guarantee and this is
something that neither [PayPal staff members], have  any control over.  
So I think Mr S was made aware  that a further  advance of cash using the Working  Capital 
facility was not guaranteed. And I think Mr S ought reasonably to have known that an 
advance under the Working Capital was not guaranteed, from his past experience of using it. 
In summary,  I appreciate  that Mr S is very disappointed by PayPals  decisions.  And I accept 
that he takes a very different view of the risk posed by his business to that of PayPal. But I 
am satisfied  that it was entitled to apply  a reserve to Business As account and to decide not 
to offer Business A further advances under the Working Capital facility.  And I do not think it 
has acted unfairly or unreasonably in the course of making these decisions.
Mr S has referred to some other  problems with PayPal   that it denied it had a member  of 
staff by the name of the person hed initially  dealt  with when applying to upgrade  his account 
to include a credit card service, and it sent him an email addressed to someone  else. I agree 
that these are examples of poor service, but Ive not seen any evidence to show  they were 
anything other than the results of genuine mistakes,  or that either  of these things had an 
impact on the decisions  PayPal made. PayPal apologised for incorrectly  addressing  the 
email, and said it had taken remedial action. Like the investigator,  I think that is reasonable 
in the circumstances. And I note PayPal identified the member of staff,  once Mr S provided  
further details.  So I do not think anything else needs to be done in relation to that. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I do not uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S, on behalf  of 
Business A to accept or reject my decision before 31 August  2019.
