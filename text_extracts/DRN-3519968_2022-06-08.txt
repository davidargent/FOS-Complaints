The complaint
Mr T complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) took too long to open an account.
What happened
Mr T applied for an account online. As part of the process, he tried to upload a copy of his 
driving licence. The copy wasnt accepted so Mr T contacted NatWest.
NatWest replied to say the copy was faint and suggested Mr T visit a branch to try and 
upload the copy. The branch couldnt help, it had the same issues as Mr T had, so he 
complained to NatWest.
NatWest replied to say it would contact its account opening team to see if it could get the 
account open. NatWest also paid Mr T £50.
NatWest couldnt open the account using Mr Ts original application because hed not used 
his full name. A second application was made, and the account was opened.
NatWest then contacted Mr T and told him it would be closing his account, so Mr T 
complained again. It took some time to get a response. Mr T then brought his complaint to 
this service.
An investigator looked into things and didnt think NatWest had made a mistake in the 
account opening process. Although it had taken some time, some of this was because Mr T 
had used his middle name instead of his first name.
The investigator thought the £50 NatWest had already paid was enough to compensate Mr T 
for the delays in the account opening process.
But the investigator thought NatWest hadnt treated Mr T fairly when it answered his second 
complaint. Mr T had to contact NatWest on six occasions before he got a response. The 
investigator thought NatWest should pay Mr T a further £50 to compensate for this.
NatWest agreed with the investigators assessment. Mr T was unhappy NatWest had 
accepted the investigators findings and asked for an ombudsman to look into things.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision, and in it I said:
I cant look into every complaint thats brought to this service. The rules I must follow are laid 
out in the Dispute Resolution Rules (DISP). DISP 2.3.1R lays out the activities I can consider 
a complaint about.
In summary, I can consider a complaint under our compulsory jurisdiction, if it relates to an 
act or omission by a financial business while carrying out a regulated activity. There are 
some other activities listed. I can also consider a complaint thats ancillary to these activities.
Complaint handling isnt a regulated activity, or another type of activity specified in the rules. 
This means it isnt something I can consider a complaint about.
Mr Ts complaint is, I think in part, about complaint handling. Mr T is unhappy it took him 
numerous attempts to log a complaint.
Ive also thought about whether this is ancillary to Mr Ts complaint about the account 
opening process, but I dont think it is. Mr Ts account was opened, which was the underlying 
issue, so I dont think the complaint itself was ancillary to the account opening.
But Mr T did experience some poor service around the account opening process. Mr T was 
sent to branch, to scan his driving licence copy, and the branch was unable to do this.
I have no doubt this was frustrating for Mr T and involved a wasted journey to the branch. 
NatWest has already paid Mr T £50 to compensate for this and I think this is a fair offer.
The closure of Mr Ts account is subject to another complaint at this service, so I wont be 
considering this.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr T responded to my provisional decision for some further clarity around our rules. Mr T 
then responded to say he didnt feel any further comments now would change things.
Mr T also asked this service to provide full and clear evidence the £50 payment so it can be 
validated.
NatWest didnt respond to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since neither Mr T nor NatWest has added anything to say why I should consider the part of 
Mr Ts complaint around complaint handling, or said anything that changes my mind around 
the £50 payment being fair, I wont be changing my provisional decision.
Mr T has asked for proof NatWest paid the £50 to him. NatWest has sent me a copy of the 
cover letter it sent with the cheque, dated 7 January 2021. NatWest has also sent in 
evidence the cheque went through the clearing process.
Im satisfied a £50 cheque was sent to Mr T and Im satisfied this cheque has been paid out. 
A copy of the cheque will be sent to Mr T.
My final decision
My decision is I cant consider part of Mr Ts complaint, about the complaint handling, as this 
isnt a regulated activity.My final decision about the account opening is I think NatWest has already done enough to 
fairly resolve this for Mr T, so I wont be upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
