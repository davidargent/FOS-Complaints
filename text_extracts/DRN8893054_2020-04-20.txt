K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent 
irresponsibly to him. 
background
Between June  2015 and March 2016, Mr H borrowed  21 loans from Sunny. His borrowing 
history is set out in full at the appendix to this decision. 
Sunny initially said it didnt agree that this service had power to look at the complaint as it 
believed Mr H had complained to us too late. However,  it later accepted  that the dispute had 
been raised in time. Just to be clear,  I dont need to consider that matter  further.  
Our adjudicator initially thought that the complaint should be upheld  in respect of loans 4 to 
21. Sunny  didnt  accept that view.  However,  it agreed that the complaint should be upheld in 
respect of loan 17 onwards. Mr H did not accept that offer. 
Another of our adjudicators then looked  at the complaint. He said he thought it should be 
upheld in respect of loans  5 to 21. Neither party replied to our adjudicators second view and 
so the matter has been passed to me to make  a final decision. 
my findings
(reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan repayments  to a given loan 
amount from a lower  level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for the complaint.
Ref: DRN88930542As I said above, early  in the lending relationship, I think Sunny was entitled  to rely on the 
information Mr H provided to it. I can see that Sunny  undertook a relatively simple credit  
check which showed that Mr H was not insolvent. It also checked his income and 
expenditure. From the figures provided,  I can see how Sunny reasonably concluded  that 
loans 1 to 4 were  sustainably  affordable.  
However, by loan 5, I think Sunny should have asked more questions. This was the fifth loan 
Mr H had applied for in one month. And it came  just three days after hed repaid loans 1 to 3. 
Loan 4 was also outstanding. Looking at the nature  of his borrowing, I think  Sunny should 
have been on notice that Mr H may be struggling financially. At this stage, I think a 
proportionate check would have constituted a full review of his financial circumstances. 
Had that review been undertaken, I think Sunny would have seen that Mr Hs monthly 
expenditure generally exceeded his income. And he was making  regular online gambling  
transactions. From loan 5 onwards, I think Sunny should have reasonably known that Mr H 
could not sustainably repay  his loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that was so, Sunny  should  have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I agree with our second adjudicator  that 
this point was reached  by loan 10. I say this because:
By now,  Sunny ought to have  realised Mr H was not managing to repay their loans 
sustainably. He had taken out 10 loans  in less than three  months. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised  it was most likely  he was having to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances  and that his indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £200  and loan 10 was for £800.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known  that Mr H was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income, but to meet an ongoing need.  He was regularly provided with a new loan within 
days of settling  a previous  loan. 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed. Loan 21 was taken out 
nine months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr H had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on his 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 9 and loans 10 to 21. Sunny must  put 
things right. 
Ref: DRN88930543putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 to 21. 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 5 to 9 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 to 21 should  be removed from Mr Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding this complaint. Elevate  Credit International 
Limited must  put things right as set out above.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 May 2020.
