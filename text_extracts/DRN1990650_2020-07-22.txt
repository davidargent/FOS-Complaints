K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that Black Horse Limited terminated his agreement  after the police 
impounded his car.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I didnt propose to uphold  the complaint. I invited 
Mr A and Black Horse  to let me have  any further  evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter. 
Neither Mr A nor Black  Horse responded to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has responded to my provisional decision. So I see no reason to reach 
different conclusions to the ones I set out in my provisional decision. 
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 August 2020.
