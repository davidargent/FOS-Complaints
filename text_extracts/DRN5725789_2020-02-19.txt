K821x#15complaint
Miss N says PDL Finance Limited   trading  as Mr Lender - irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 16 short-term loans Mr Lender provided to Miss N between October 
2014 and September 2018. Miss Ns borrowing history is as follows:
Our adjudicator partly upheld Miss Ns complaint and thought loans 5 to 7 and loans 12 to 16 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of the borrowing  suggested  that 
Miss N wasnt  managing her money. Mr Lender disagreed  and the complaint was passed to 
me.

Ref: DRN57257892could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Miss N could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ns complaint. Having  done this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why.  
There was a significant break in Miss Ns borrowing from Mr Lender.  There  was a gap of 
around six months between loans  7 and 8. I think it would be reasonable for Mr Lender to 
view this gap as an indication that Miss Ns finances  had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances were  that had caused her to take out her previous loans. There was another 
gap of around six months between loans 12 and 13. But given the length of time Miss N had 
been borrowing  from Mr Lender at this point, I think its reasonable to not consider this as a 
break in the lending. So, I will look at Miss Ns borrowing  in two separate  lending chains. 
Chain one was made up of loans 1 to 7. And chain two was loans 8 to 16. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Ns complaint about loans 1 to 4 in chain one and loans 8 
to 11 in chain  two. Miss N didnt  respond  to the adjudicators opinion.  As there  appears  to be 
Ref: DRN57257893no dispute about these loans, I wont be making  any further findings on them  other than they 
formed part of Miss Ns overall borrowing. 
Chain one  loans 1 to 7
This chain  of borrowing consisted of a mixture of payday and instalment loans. Mr Lender 
says it carried out checks  before  it lent loan 5 to Miss N and the results showed Miss N had 
enough disposable income  to make the repayments. But as this was Miss Ns fifth loan in 
seven months, I think Mr Lender should have been  looking to build a clearer  picture  about  
Miss Ns finances before  lending her this loan.
I say this because  the behaviour of Miss Ns borrowing gave a likely indication  she was 
struggling with her finances. Miss N was taking out another loan within a couple  of weeks  of 
repaying her previous  one. She was also fluctuating  in how long she was repaying  these 
loans back as Loan 5 was taken  out over a longer period than the immediate three  loans 
shed taken out. Her erratic borrowing does seem likely to indicate she had financial 
circumstances which were unstable  and the length of time she was borrowing  for would also 
indicate this wasnt  a short-term problem. 
Miss N also repaid both loan 5 and 6 early.  I think the fact she did ought to have caused  
some concern to Mr Lender. As  again  - that might be the sort of behaviour that would 
indicate someone was facing  problems  managing  their money  and needing to refinance  
loans on a regular  basis.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Miss N, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ns case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7 I say 
this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Miss N was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss N had taken out seven loans within nine months. So, 
Mr Lender ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Miss N was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ns first loan in this chain  was for £116 and loan 7 was for £400.  At this point 
Mr Lender ought  to have  known  that Miss N was likely not borrowing to just meet  a 
temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss N wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender.  Loan 7 
was taken out nine months  after Miss Ns first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss N 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss N lost out because Mr Lender  continued to provide borrowing for loan 7 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ns indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period.
Ref: DRN57257894the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss N borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ns ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Miss Ns complaints about  loans 5, 6 and 7. 
Chain two  loans 8 to 16
Like chain one, this chain was made up of instalment and payday  loans. As Ive mentioned 
above, although there was a six month break  in Miss Ns borrowing between  loans  12 and 
13, overall Miss N had been a customer of Mr Lenders for almost three years and in that 
time had received a total of 13 loans. So, I havent considered  this to be a break in the 
lending. 
Like with the first chain,  Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history  with 
Miss N for this chain  as well. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ns case, I think the point in which  it wouldve been 
reasonable for Mr Lender to have seen  that further  borrowing was unsustainable (or 
otherwise harmful) was reached by loan 12. I say this because:
Again,  by this point,  Mr Lender  should have  realised  Miss N was not managing to 
repay her loans sustainably. Miss N had taken out a further five loans within ten 
months and shed been indebted  to Mr Lender  for nearly two and a half years.  So,  
Mr Lender ought  to have  realised it was more likely than not Miss N was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ns first loan in this chain  was for £100 and loan 7 was for £200.  At this point 
Mr Lender ought  to have  known  that Miss N was likely not borrowing to just meet  a 
temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss N wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender.  Loan 12 
was taken out nearly two and a half years  after Miss Ns first loan overall and 10 
months after her first in this chain. And it was for a larger amount. Miss N had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Mr Lender over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss N lost out because Mr Lender  continued to provide borrowing for loan 7 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ns indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss N borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ns ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I also uphold Miss Ns complaint about  loans 12 to 16. 
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
Ref: DRN57257895refund  all interest and charges Miss N paid on loans 5 to 7 and loans 12 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 6 from Miss Ns credit  file;
any information recorded about  loan 7 and loans 12 to 16 is adverse. So, all entries  
about these loans should be removed  from Miss Ns credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Miss N a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ns complaint.  PDL  Finance 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 March 2020.
