The complaint
Mrs B complains about what happened when she tried to claim under the buyer protection 
policy offered by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, for an expensive purchase that wasnt delivered.
What happened
Mrs B said shed made an expensive purchase, and paid £529.07 for it using PayPal. But 
the parcel wasnt delivered. Initially, the courier said this was delivered. But when she 
checked, the courier said something different. It then said it had left the parcel in a 
communal area in the entrance to her building. Mrs B says this isnt secured in any way, and 
people can just walk in off the street. The courier now says the parcel was left in an insecure 
location, and it has been deemed as lost. 
Mrs B tried to claim from PayPal under its buyer protection scheme, but PayPal turned her 
down. PayPal said it had received proof of delivery from the seller. It showed us pictures of 
what the couriers website said just after the delivery. And PayPal sent us an excerpt from its 
user agreement, covering buyer protection. That said - 
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item 
Not Received claim, if: 
 You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, 
including if you use PayPal in a seller's retail point of sale, except for in-person 
PayPal QR code goods and services transactions. 
 The seller has provided proof of delivery. 
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find 
in favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not 
receive the goods.
Our investigator suggested that PayPal should reconsider, because Mrs B had provided 
more up to date information, which confirmed the parcel was not left in a secure location. So 
our investigator said the goods may have been taken by someone else. But PayPal said that 
the initial tracking information showed the item was delivered. PayPal said it was not in a 
position to issue a refund because the way a delivery is fulfilled by the courier and the 
conditions in which it occurs are outside of PayPals control. PayPal still thought this fell 
outside of its buyer protection policy.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said that PayPal had relied on 
information which was out of date, and not taken into account that the courier no longer says 
the parcel was delivered. Our investigator said that there was enough evidence to support 
Mrs Bs claim that she didnt receive the goods. 
Our investigator said that PayPal should refund the full cost of the purchase, which was 
£529.07, pay 8% simple interest on that refund from the date of the transaction, and pay £50 
in compensation. 
PayPal didnt agree. It said that it had worked the claim Mrs B made according to the policies 
set out in its user agreement. It repeated that tracking information showed the parcel was 
delivered. PayPal said it had a definition of proof of delivery, which was met when the case 
was reviewed. The courier company had confirmed that the delivery occurred at the correct 
address, just not into Mrs Bs hands. PayPal didnt think it should be held responsible just 
because the courier company had marked the item as delivered, despite having left it 
somewhere insecure. 
PayPal also said it didnt pay interest on money held in users accounts. 
Because no agreement was reached, this case came to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
PayPal said that it had received proof of delivery. It says this is no longer visible on the 
couriers website, because of the passage of time. 
PayPal says its not fair to hold it responsible, when the courier company has marked an 
item as delivered but just not put it in a safe place. But PayPal does accept responsibility 
under its buyer protection policy when the courier company doesnt deliver. So its not clear 
to me why PayPal wouldnt accept responsibility, once the courier company has accepted it 
made a mistake in recording the item as delivered. 
And I think thats whats happened here. Mrs B has now checked with the courier company. 
It no longer says the item was delivered, and has noted it as lost. It has also said that its 
unable to change the website record of the delivery, because of the passage of time. 
I agree with our investigator that its unreasonable for PayPal to continue to rely on evidence 
of proof of delivery from the courier, when that evidence isnt current, and the courier now 
says this evidence is wrong. Like her, I also think that this claim shouldve been reviewed by 
PayPal, once Mrs B had made PayPal aware of this. And I think if it had been fairly 
reviewed, then PayPal wouldve reached a different view. 
For that reason, I think its fair to ask PayPal to return the money that Mrs B was deprived of. 
Although PayPal doesnt pay interest on money held in its accounts, our service does 
sometimes make awards of interest when someones been deprived of funds. And I think it 
would be appropriate in this case to do so. So I also agree that PayPal should pay interest 
on its refund at 8% simple, from the date of purchase to the date the refund is made. 
Finally, I note that Mrs B has told us about a medical condition, which is exacerbated by 
stress, and I think that PayPals decision has made this a stressful experience for Mrs B. So 
I think PayPal should also pay Mrs B £50 in compensation. My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Mrs B 
- a refund of £529.071, 
-
- 8% simple interest on that refund from the date of the transaction to the date the 
refund is paid
-
- £50 in compensation.

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2021.
