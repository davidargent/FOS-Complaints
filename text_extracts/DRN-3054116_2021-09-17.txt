The complaint
 Miss C complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
 In November 2016, Miss C asked for a marbles card from NewDay  it was agreed with a 
limit of £300. Further increases were offered and put in place:
NewDay gave a COVID19 payment holiday for three months until July 2020. But by then, 
Miss C was in arrears. The account was suspended and passed to NewDays recovery unit 
in October 2020 with the balance £5810.72 debit.
Miss C complained. She said she shouldnt have been given the increased limits. She was 
only making the minimum payments. She had payday loans, including a new loan of £5000 
taken out in April 2019. NewDay shouldve seen she couldnt afford the borrowing. She said 
the entries on her credit file should be removed, interest and charges refunded and 8% per 
annum added to the refunds.
NewDay said Miss C told them  when she applied for the card  that she earned a salary of 
£10800 per annum, and she had debts of £13900. She had passed their credit tests at each 
increase. There were no arrears or defaults showing in her records. There was one active 
payday loan in 2017. Payments had been made on time. Miss C couldve opted out of the 
offers of increased limits but didnt. The entries on her credit file were correct and should 
remain in place. As a gesture of goodwill, they refunded some fees totalling £36, plus £15.
 Miss C brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said NewDay hadnt lent responsibly in 
line with guidance. She felt that the checks hadnt been proportionate to the limits. She 
couldnt conclude that the increases before June 2019 werent OK. But by 2019, Miss Cs 
circumstances had changed. She had moved to a new house and started a family and was 
on the same salary. So, by then, the payments werent affordable. She said that all interest 
and charges from June 2019 should be refunded, and 8% per annum simple added to the 
refunded amount. He said the entries on Miss Cs credit file should remain  as it was likely 
that she would default again on the remaining balance, so any future entries on the credit file 
wouldnt help Miss C as they would be dated later and remain on her record for six years.
NewDay disagreed. They werent to know that Miss Cs circumstances would change. Miss 
C hadnt made a payment to her account since March 2020, nor had she proposed any 
Date Limit
November 2016 £300
April 2017 £850
August 2017 £1600
December 2017 £2100
June 2019 £3700
September 2019 £5450payments. They restated that she had passed their credit tests at each stage.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether NewDay 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as 
set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a fair 
lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender 
knew about the borrowers circumstances?
And a reasonable and proportionate check would usually need to be more thorough:
othe lower a customers income, and the higher amount to be repaid.
othe greater the number of loans and frequency of loans.
othe longer the term of the loans
So  Ive considered Miss Cs complaint in the light of this guidance. And for me, the crux of 
her complaint is that the checks that NewDay shouldve done must have been proportionate 
to the limits being offered and have regard also to her circumstances and salary.
I can see that when Miss C asked for a card in November 2016, she was earning a gross 
salary of £10800 and was single and lived with her parents. But she also had other debts of
£13900. NewDay noted she had high indebtedness  and for me, this was a substantial 
amount by comparison with her salary. But there wasnt any evidence of defaults or CCJs  
and so I can see that the card was agreed with a low credit limit of £300  that was OK.
Looking at the further increases in limit in April 2017 (£850) through to December 2017 
(£2100), I can agree that NewDays checks were OK in comparison to the limits being 
offered. Payments were being met  albeit only at the minimum levels. The balance was 
within the limits. NewDay could see there were still other debts of just over £12000  but this 
was a little less that in 2016. But there were four payday loans in place by May 2017  with 
several new ones being taken out between April 2017 and July 2017. So  there were some 
warning signs that all was not well. But on balance, I can agree that it was OK to increase 
the limits in the way they did. And  I note that Miss C couldve opted out of the increases 
but didnt.
Looking at the increase in June 2019 to £3700. I think there were enough signs of difficulties 
to say that NewDay shouldve made more inquiries of Miss C before offering to increase her 
limit. The increase wouldve meant a total increase from £300 to £3700 in just over two and 
a half years. Thats a lot. And by then, NewDay had seen that Miss C only made minimum 
payments for a long time  since 2016. The borrowing was consistently at the limit. And 
importantly, NewDay could see there was other borrowing in March 2019 of £18495  this 
had increased from £12000 in December 2017, and by any measure, this was a lot for 
someone earning £10800 per annum. Miss C told us she borrowed a further £5000 from a payday lender in April 2019  and I can see that this is on her credit file and that she paid off 
NewDay with that money in that month. NewDay told us they couldnt be aware of where the 
money came from, and I appreciate their point. But equally - for Miss C to pay off a balance 
of £1859 (as she did) after having only made minimum payments for over two years  and in 
the light of her having a lot of other debts  shouldve caused NewDay to ask some 
questions, but they didnt.
I can see that Miss Cs circumstances did change in 2019  NewDay have argued that they 
couldnt have known this, and I agree with them on that point. But  in the light of what they 
could see by June 2019, NewDay shouldve made more inquiries of Miss C at that time. And 
it follows that the same applies to the limit increase to £5450 in September 2019  just three 
months later. By this time, Miss Cs debts had increased to almost £21000.
And so, I think that NewDay should refund all interest and charges on the borrowing over 
£2100 from June 2019 (as I think that the increase to £2100 was OK). I note that Miss C 
hasnt been charged interest since March 2020 and, some fees have been refunded already. 
Should the refunds result in a credit balance, then 8% simple per annum should be added 
from the date the credit balance arose. They should remove any adverse entries from Miss 
Cs credit file from June 2019. While I hear what our investigator said about possible future 
entries on it, I dont think we can predict that will be the case, and its best to ensure an 
accurate record is put in place at the current time. And  I note that no payments have been 
made by Miss C since March 2020. So, following the refunds, New C should agree a 
mutually acceptable payment plan for the remaining debt.
Responses to the provisional decision:
NewDay had no comments. Miss C accepted my findings and asked if the refund would be 
in reduction of the debt or paid to her.
So  I need to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 As NewDay, nor Miss C didnt have any material comments, I wont be departing from my 
provisional decision and for the reasons I gave in it. In response to Miss Cs question  the 
interest refund should be made to the card debt  as this was where the interest was 
originally debited to. And this would also enable the repayment schedule to start from a 
lower balance.
(continued)
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And NewDay Ltd must:
Refund interest and charges on the debt over £2100 from June 2019 to the date of 
any final decision - noting the refunds already made. This to be credited to the card 
debt.
If a credit balance results, add 8% per annum simple to the refund.
Remove any adverse entries from Miss Cs credit file from June 2019.Agree a mutually acceptable repayment plan for the remaining balance.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 October 2021.
