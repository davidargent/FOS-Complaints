K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Close Brothers Limited, trading as Close Brothers  Motor Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality. Hes being helped  with his complaint by a representative.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator so I wont repeat them again  here. Instead Ill focus on giving  the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
Close  Brothers  upheld Mr Ss complaint that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it 
was supplied  to him because  the chassis was heavily  corroded  so it accepted his 
rejection of the car and paid him compensation of £3,042.35;
Mr S claimed further compensation  and a complaint was made to this service;
the adjudicator recommended  that Close Brothers should  refund: the £2,000 deposit, 
with interest; £533.76 in monthly  payments; £183.72 in insurance payments; £85.80 in 
road tax payments;  £140 in inspection  costs; £413.90  for the cost of previous repairs;  
and £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused (less the £3,042.35 that it had 
already paid him);
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S would be prepared to settle matters on the basis of 
that recommendation;
Close  Brothers  says it shouldnt have to pay £413.90 for replacement  brake  discs  and 
pads and a wheel hub because they are serviceable items that would  be expected to be 
replaced during the lifetime of the car - and Mr S had that work done after he had 
completed over 15,000  miles in the car and it wasnt required due to a defect  developing 
or present  at the point  of purchase;
Mr S paid £413.90  for a front wheel hub and the front brake pads and brake discs to be 
replaced in July 2018, the first inspection  about the corrosion took place the following  
month and Close Brothers has agreed to refund Mr Ss monthly  payments  from 
September 2018 - so he received little benefit  from those repairs; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Close Brothers to 
reimburse Mr S for the cost of those repairs and to pay him the other amounts that were 
recommended by the adjudicator.
Ref: DRN14593902my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint and I order Close Brothers  
Limited, trading  as Close Brothers Motor Finance,  to pay the following amounts  to him (from 
which the payment  of £3,042.35 that it has already made to him should  be deducted):
1.£2,000 to refund him for the deposit that he paid for the car (and it should pay 
interest on that amount at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date of payment to 
the date of settlement).
2.£533.76 to refund him for the monthly  payments from September 2018.
3.£183.72 to reimburse him for his insurance payments.
4.£85.80 to reimburse him for his road tax payments.
5.£140 to reimburse him for the costs  of the inspections.
6.£413.90 to reimburse him for the cost of the replacement hub cap and brakes.
7.£150 to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Close Brothers to deduct tax from the interest  payment 
referred to above.  Close Brothers must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 June  2020.
