The complaint
Mr B complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) is holding him responsible for a 
credit account he didnt open.
What happened
Mr B noticed an entry on his credit file for a PayPal account he didnt recognise. The account 
had been defaulted and had an outstanding balance.
Mr B raised this with a credit file provider and a fraud prevention site. Mr B complained to 
PayPal and it responded to say it couldnt see any unauthorised use of the account.
PayPal said it would continue to hold Mr B liable for the outstanding balance. And PayPal 
said it wouldnt remove the defaulted account from Mr Bs credit file.
Mr B wasnt happy with this response, so he asked an investigator at this service to look into 
things. The investigator thought Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. The investigator couldnt 
see anything that proved Mr B had applied for the account.
The investigator thought PayPal should remove the account from Mr Bs credit file, stop 
pursuing Mr B for any outstanding balance and pay £300 trouble and upset.
Mr B felt the trouble and upset payment wasnt enough to compensate for the stress hes 
gone through. Mr B says he was unable to move house or take out other credit.
PayPal disagreed with the investigators assessment. It said Mr Bs account was linked to 
other accounts that had been used fraudulently. PayPal also said it spoke to Mr B not long 
after the account had been opened and Mr B had confirmed he had lots of PayPal accounts.
The complaint was referred to an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its difficult for Mr B to prove a negative, that he didnt open the account. Ive looked at 
whether PayPal can, on the balance of probabilities, show that Mr B opened the account. 
PayPal opened up a credit account. The agreement for this account is regulated by the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. Section 83 of this act says:
Liability for misuse of credit facilities
(1) The debtor under a regulated consumer credit agreement shall not be liable to the 
creditor for any loss arising from use of the credit facility by another person not 
acting, or to be treated as acting, as the debtors agent.
When I say Mr B I also mean an agent  someone acting on Mr Bs behalf with his 
agreement.
I have to decide if Mr B opened and used this account. If I think Mr B did then PayPal can 
fairly hold him liable for the amount owed and record the account on his credit file.
But if I dont think Mr B opened or used the account then PayPal cant fairly hold him liable or 
record the agreement on his credit file.
PayPal says it opened the account using Mr Bs details including his correct home address. 
PayPal didnt take any secondary or photographic identification.
There isnt an obligation on PayPal to take identification. But its not unreasonable to think 
someone else may have got hold of Mr Bs name and address. I dont think just the use of 
Mr Bs details is enough to say, on balance, Mr B opened the account.
Mr B has lived at his current address for some time, this is evident from his credit file. The 
address on the PayPal account was changed soon after the account opened. The different 
address is recorded on Mr Bs credit file, but only because of the PayPal entry.
I cant see any other link between Mr B and the address the PayPal account is registered at 
now.
Mr B says he received some postal correspondence from an online-market place, quite soon 
after the PayPal account was opened. Mr B says he spoke to the marketplace as he didnt 
recognise the transaction and it resolved things for him.
I think if Mr B received any paperwork posted to him by PayPal, he would have raised this 
unknown account with PayPal. But it appears PayPal emailed the credit agreement to 
whoever opened the account. The email used isnt one Mr B says he recognises.
I dont think Mr B would have known anything about the PayPal account when it was first 
opened. And I dont think Mr B received the default notices either, these were posted to the 
changed address.
I dont think its likely Mr B would open the PayPal account, using his current, correct 
address, then change the address to one he has no link to. I think its more likely an 
unknown third party would do this, to avoid Mr B being sent anything from PayPal that might 
tell him about the account.
Ive seen Mr Bs credit report, theres a couple of historic late payments but otherwise Mr B 
has always repaid his credit. And there are quite a lot of credit entries for higher amounts 
than PayPal lent.
I dont think Mr B would open the PayPal account and then purposely not repay it, adversely 
affecting his credit file.
PayPal says it spoke to Mr B when the account hadnt been repaid. During this conversation PayPal says Mr B confirmed he had lots of PayPal accounts.
It doesnt seem PayPals thought about whether it was actually Mr B it spoke to or an 
unknown person that had opened the account and was simply pretending to be Mr B.
PayPals provided information about the accounts its linked to the one opened in Mr Bs 
name. I can see the account on Mr Bs credit file was opened at a later date than some of 
those linked accounts.
I dont think its very likely Mr B would have successfully opened PayPal accounts in 
someone elses name then used his own details to open a further account. If Mr B had 
opened these earlier, linked accounts its unlikely they would have been traced to him, they 
were in other peoples names.
For Mr B to then open an account in his name and address, traceable to him, seems very 
unlikely.
I think its more likely the same unknown third party opened all these accounts, including the 
one in Mr Bs name.
And because I believe its more likely someone else opened this account in Mr Bs name, I 
dont believe he can be held responsible for the account.
Putting things right
Because I dont think PayPal can fairly hold Mr B responsible for the account, it should 
remove the account from Mr Bs credit file. By removing the entry entirely this will also 
remove any adverse entries on Mr Bs credit file.
And because I dont think Mr B can be held responsible for the account, PayPal cant hold 
him responsible for the outstanding amount. PayPal should stop pursuing Mr B for the 
outstanding amount owed on the account.
Mr B feels the award for trouble and upset is too low. Ive considered what Mr Bs said, and 
what PayPals done. PayPal opened the account in good faith, I cant see anything that 
indicates it should have realised it wasnt Mr B opening the account at the time.
But I think once Mr B told PayPal the account wasnt opened by him it should have decided 
Mr B wasnt responsible for the account or the debt. The period of time between Mr B 
noticing the account and PayPals decision to continue to hold him responsible wasnt long.
Mr B was then free to bring his complaint to this service. Although Im aware its been some 
time since PayPal decided to hold Mr B responsible for the debt, this isnt necessarily 
PayPals fault, so I cant fairly ask it to compensate for the entire delay.
Any adverse marker on Mr Bs credit file is likely to affect his ability to get credit. And I can 
see hes made efforts with other businesses to get the entry removed. This has added to his 
trouble and upset.
Overall, I think a payment of £300 is fair in the circumstances.
My final decisionMy final decision is I uphold Mr Bs complaint and PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must:
remove the account from Mr Bs credit file
stop pursuing Mr B for any outstanding debt arising from this account
pay Mr B £300 for the trouble and upset hes been caused
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
