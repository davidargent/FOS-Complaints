DRN-2944124
The complaint
Mr T complains about the poor service he received from The National Farmers' Union 
Mutual Insurance Society Limited (NFU) when he used the roadside assistance service 
under his motor insurance policy.
What happened
Mr T has a motor insurance policy underwritten by NFU and as its ultimately responsible for 
this complaint, Ill refer to it throughout. References I make to NFUs actions include the 
actions of its roadside assistance agent.
The parties are familiar with the background to this complaint so Ill only provide a summary 
here:
Mr Ts motor insurance policy provides roadside assistance, in certain 
circumstances, if his car breaks down
He was in the car park of a supermarket and his car wouldnt start so he contacted 
NFU 
It said one of its engineers would attend and the waiting time was up to five hours
When Mr T wasnt happy with this NFU said he would be prioritised over some other 
callers but not over those in a dangerous situation
It offered him a taxi and Mr T agreed, asking for a larger car so he could maintain 
social distance from his companions
Due to this size requirement, the taxi had to be dispatched from more than 50 miles 
away and took some time to arrive
NFUs agent arrived a little over two hours after the first call and got the car started 
so Mr T was able to continue his journey
He complained to NFU about the time hed had to wait and it said it couldnt 
guarantee attendance times but always did its best to get to callers as quickly as 
possible
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint and Mr T asked an ombudsman to make 
a decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms of Mr Ts motor insurance policy dont specify expected attendance times
Ive not seen anything to suggest Mr T was in a dangerous situation or that there 
were exceptional circumstances which might have required NFU to attend more 
quickly
So, while I acknowledge Mr T thought NFU should have got to him quicker, Ive not 
seen any evidence to show this expectation was as a consequence of misleading 
information from NFU, more just what Mr T thinks ought to have happened
Im satisfied NFU prioritised Mr T appropriately taking into consideration his 
circumstances and that an attendance time of just over two hours was reasonable, 
although I acknowledge Mr T doesnt agree
There were some additional issues around the indicated length of time the taxi would 
take to arrive and I can see how this would have been frustrating
But Im satisfied the time it took was reasonable given it had to travel from more than 
50 miles away and it didnt extend the time Mr T was waiting as the recovery agent 
arrived before the taxi anyway
I wont be upholding this complaint or asking NFU to do anymore
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2021.
