K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) hasnt accepted a 
promissory note his father sent it.
Mr H is represented by his father  in bringing  his complaint. But for ease of reading Ill refer to 
him alone when  talking  about any submissions he and his father  have made.
background
Mr Hs father  sent NatWest a promissory  note in December 2017.  That note showed that his 
father promised to pay Mr H £890,000 in monthly  instalments  of £2,000  per month.  Postal 
records confirm NatWest  received this note.
NatWest didnt accept  the note as a form of payment though and explained how his father 
could make a payment  in a way it would  accept. Mr H didnt agree with this though. He felt 
that since NatWest received the note, it had become  legal tender and by not sending  it back 
to his father   it couldnt show that it hadnt  benefited from it.
Mr H brought his complaint to our service where  a senior investigator  looked at it. He didnt  
think NatWest had done anything wrong. He said that it was under no obligation to accept 
the note, which was  in effect  just an agreement between Mr H and his father. He couldnt 
see anything to suggest that NatWest  should be liable for the amount in the note and nor did 
he think that NatWest had dealt with the request and the situation around it unfairly.
Mr H strongly  disagreed and said that the senior  investigator hadnt taken into account  the 
law or given sufficient reason for his opinion. So the case has been  referred  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H has raised  a number of issues around why he thinks  NatWest should accept this note. 
Ive had regard  for all hes said and sent us, alongside taking into account what the relevant 
law says too (in particular  the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 (the Act)).  Having done  so, I cant 
see any reason that it would be fair or reasonable to tell NatWest  that it should  accept the 
promissory note here. Nor do I think that NatWest  has dealt with the situation unreasonably.
A promissory note like the one here isnt legal  tender and nor is it strictly money at all. Its a 
promise to pay a sum at some future  date (or dates). Here that promise is between  Mr H and 
his father. But it doesnt mean  that NatWest had to accept this promise  and arrangement  
over any other such binding arrangement it may already have with Mr H.
Here, I dont  accept that, by not returning the note, NatWest should be viewed as having 
accepted it. Thats especially  in light of NatWest being very clear  that it hasnt accepted it 
and having explained why.
Mr H has said that NatWest should return the note and the fact it hasnt done so is 
concerning, because theres  no guarantee that it hasnt benefited from the note in some way. 
But NatWest  didnt  consider this to be legal tender and it hasnt accepted the note  so it has 
no actual value. 
Ref: DRN01369282I realise that Mr H thinks that the Act hes mentioned  means that NatWest were duty bound  
to send the note back. But in the circumstances,  I think that explaining that it hadnt accepted 
the note and telling Mr H how else the payment could be made is a fair way of dealing  with 
this situation.  NatWest no longer holds the original note so it cant  return  this to him. 
I dont think itd be fair to say that NatWest now has to accept the note because  of a type of 
technicality here. If Mr Hs father  wants to make payments in the way the note suggests, he 
is, and always has been, able to try and do so in alternative ways. So, I dont think itd be fair 
for this service to tell NatWest it should compensate  Mr H here for actions that ultimately 
havent had any detriment to him  even though I know he sees  it differently.
Ive considered all Mr Hs points around why he thinks  NatWest  should accept the note and 
why it should be binding on it  even where it has been clear that it hasnt accepted  it. But for 
the reasons above, I dont think NatWest is under any obligation to accept  the note or do 
anything more than its already done here. Its stopped corresponding with Mr H about  the 
matter and its entitled to do that  where continued correspondence about  this matter wasnt  
helpful.
Mr H has explained why, in light of the Act hes mentioned, he thinks  this promissory note is 
legally binding. Ive taken account of the Act here in reaching my decision, but still not found 
that NatWest has acted unfairly. As were  an alternative to the court  then Mr H is free to 
raise these issues legally if he chooses  to reject  my decision here.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 January 2020.
