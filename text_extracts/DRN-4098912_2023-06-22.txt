The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount British Gas Services Limited (BGSL) has paid him after he 
cancelled his Homecare cover with them.
What happened
Mr S had a HomeCare policy with BGSL that ran annually from 30 October to 29 October 
each year. Mr S was told his policy cover on renewal at October 2021 would be £531.48, but 
before the renewal period started this was discounted further by BGSL to £444. 
As Mr S paid for his HomeCare policy each month this equated to 12 monthly direct debit 
instalments of £36.98. A further discount was applied in May 2022 reducing the annual cover 
to £415.54. BGSL reduced Mr S monthly direct debit payments to £31.36 for June 2022, 
and £31.27 for the remaining months of the policy.
Mr S changed address and no longer wanted the cover provided by the HomeCare policy. 
He cancelled the policy in August 2022 and asked BGSL to refund any overpayment hed 
made. BSGL said that their calculations showed Mr S didnt have any refund due to him as 
hed underpaid for the period he was covered. Mr S didnt agree and complained to BGSL.
BGSL said Mr S owed £63 for the period he was covered by the policy but said they would 
write this off. Mr S didnt agree and provided his own calculations. Mr S said this showed 
BGSL owed him £10.08. BGSL said that while they disputed Mr S calculations they agreed 
to refund him this amount to resolve the complaint. And BGSL sent this payment to Mr S by 
cheque but he said he didnt receive it. BGSL sent another cheque for the same amount but 
again Mr S said he didnt receive it. BGSL acknowledged the error in sending Mr S cheque 
to his previous address and offered to pay an additional £10 to compensate him for this.
Mr S wasnt happy with BGSLs response and referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said BGSL had acted fairly and reasonably. Theyd sent Mr S a cheque as a 
gesture of goodwill for £10.08 when theyd shown Mr S wasnt due any refund. And theyd 
acknowledged the distress caused when he hadnt received this payment. Our investigator 
said BGSL had put things right in a fair and reasonable way.
Mr S didnt agree and has asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr S isnt satisfied about how BGSL has resolved his complaint, as by his 
calculations he feels strongly that BGSL owed him a refund for the premiums hed paid for 
his HomeCare cover policy.
While I empathise with Mr S, for me to say BGSL must do something different I must first be 
satisfied that they have acted unfairly and unreasonably in their actions with him. I cant see
that they have here which is why I wont be asking them to do anything else.
BGSL has provided the details of how they calculated the premiums Mr S paid against the 
total policy amount over the time of the cover. From what theyve shown they calculated the 
cost of cover for 30 October 2021 to 25 May 2022, based on the annual amount of £444 to 
be £253.02. And for the period 26 May 2022 until 16 August 2022 based on an annual cost 
of £415.54 to be £94.49. A total of £347.51. As Mr S paid £284.51 this meant there was a 
shortfall in his payments of £63 for the period he was covered. BGSL said they wouldnt ask 
Mr S to pay the shortfall amount, and his policy was cancelled.
But as the annual policy amount was reduced to £415.54, I think the amount owed by Mr S 
should have been based on that figure alone. This would make a daily amount of £1.138, the 
cover was in place for 291 days, so I calculate that Mr S would have needed to pay a total of 
£331.29. I can see Mr S paid six monthly payments of £36.98, one of £31.36, and one of 
£31.27 in total £284.51. So, Im think there was a shortfall of £46.78 in the premiums Mr S 
paid for the period his HomeCare policy would have been active for. 
Mr S said that his direct debits should have been taken by BGSL from November 2021. Mr S 
has provided a November 2021 bank statement, but I havent seen any evidence of this 
payment having been taken. So, I cant say this payment was made by Mr S, and Mr S 
doesnt dispute this, only that he shouldnt be accountable for BGSL not taking the payment. 
But even if this payment had been taken there would still have been a shortfall in the amount 
he owed for the time he was covered by the policy.
By my calculation when Mr S had the further reduction in May 2022, hed paid six payments 
of £36.98 totalling £221.88, this would have left him a balance of £193.66 to pay over the 
remaining period of his policy, June to October 2022. Which I think meant his direct debit 
payment should have been £38.74 for June and £38.73 for the remaining months, so that in 
total he would have paid £415.54. But BGSL calculated the revision on the basis that Mr S 
had paid his direct debit in November 2021.
While I accept Mr S comment that BGSL had miscalculated his premiums, and that they 
should have taken a direct debit in November 2021. I can only ask BGSL to put Mr S back 
into the position he would have been in if they had done things correctly. As outlined above 
for the time that Mr S did have HomeCare cover, he hadnt paid enough. So, I cant ask 
BGSL to pay him something he isnt owed.
 
As a gesture of goodwill BGSL agreed to pay Mr S £10.08, I know there have been issues 
with the cheque(s) being sent to Mr S previous address. But I can see that the new occupier 
has sent these on to him. So, I dont consider this to have had any financial  impact on him. 
BGSL has accepted that this did cause some distress as Mr S had the inconvenience of 
having to find out what had happened to the cheque(s). They have offered an additional 
£10.to compensate Mr S for this which I think is fair..
My final decision
British Gas Services Limited has paid Mr S £10.00 for distress and inconvenience. And I 
think thats fair in the circumstances, so I dont require British Gas Services Limited to do 
anything more to put things right.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2023.
