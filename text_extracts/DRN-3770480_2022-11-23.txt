The complaint
Miss D complains NewDay Ltd misinformed her about the impact of her payment 
arrangement, its effect on her credit file and generally provided poor service and support.   
What happened
Miss D holds a credit card account with NewDay. In or around December 2021, she 
contacted NewDay after they wrote to her about missed payments on her account. She said 
her financial circumstances had been adversely affected and asked for help and support. 
NewDay placed her account on hold for 90 days, suspending interest and charges.
Miss D wasnt happy with how NewDay had treated her during the call. She felt the 
questions theyd asked were inappropriate and theyd showed little understanding of her 
personal circumstances. So, she complained to NewDay.
NewDay agreed the service shed received was unacceptable and paid her compensation of 
£75. As a gesture of goodwill, they also refunded three fees theyd charged in November 
2021 totalling £36. NewDay confirmed this in a letter.
Miss D called NewDay again late in February 2022. She asked that the agreed 
compensation be paid to her normal bank account rather than her NewDay account, which 
NewDay agreed to arrange. Miss D was also unhappy about a letter shed received advising 
that her account had been terminated. She said NewDay hadnt explained the impact of the 
90 day hold clearly to her.
Having investigated Miss Ds complaint, NewDay found that she had been misinformed 
about the termination of her account. A monthly payment plan of £8.99 was agreed on 3 
March 2022 and it appears shed been asked to make a payment to avoid the account 
termination. But the account had already been terminated. NewDay agreed Miss D had been 
misinformed and agreed to pay further compensation of £115. NewDay confirmed this in a 
letter.
Miss D called NewDay again in or around April 2022. Despite previously providing her bank 
details, she hadnt received the additional compensation. NewDay found that theyd made a 
mistake when they took Miss Ds bank details. They apologised, corrected their mistake and 
increased the additional compensation from £115 to £200 to reflect this.
Although Miss D accepted the compensation offered, she didnt think it was enough. So, she 
decided to refer her complaint to this service. She said:
the arrangement to pay £8.99 each month was cancelled then reinstated by NewDay; 
and
NewDay acted unfairly by agreeing an arrangement but then closing her account and 
issuing a default letter; and
shes concerned NewDay may have recorded a default on her credit file as a result of 
their mistakes; and
shed had to call NewDay numerous times because of their errors: and
NewDay were aware of her personal health circumstances and their actions added to 
these.
Miss D thought NewDay should pay her additional compensation of £300 and remove any 
adverse data recorded on her credit file.
Our investigator agreed NewDay had made mistakes here but didnt think they needed to do 
anything more. Miss D didnt agree with our investigator. She said her credit record had 
been affected by NewDays mistakes. Miss D felt the compensation paid by NewDay didnt 
adequately reflect the distress and upset caused by constantly having to chase and 
complain to them.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Miss Ds complaint has been passed to me to 
consider further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay have accepted they made mistakes in the way they handled their relationship with 
Miss D. Theyve apologised and paid compensation at a level they believe is appropriate 
here. Although Ive considered all thats happened, I dont propose to comment further on 
the events within my decision. The circumstances are already well known to both Miss D and 
NewDay.
NewDays decision to terminate Miss Ds account is part of their process where financial 
difficulties are identified and support in the form of forbearance is necessary. Theyve 
explained this is done to help ensure that her debt with them doesnt continue to rise further. 
It isnt the role of this service to ask a business to alter its policies or procedures. These 
aspects fall firmly within the remit of the regulator  in this case, the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). But it is our role to examine and decide whether NewDay have been fair 
and reasonable in the manner in which those policies and procedures are applied in the 
individual circumstances of Miss Ds experience with them. And accepting the mistakes they 
made, Im persuaded that suspension or termination of her account was appropriate here.
Miss D has expressed concern about how NewDays actions impacted her credit file with the 
credit reference agencies. NewDay have confirmed they agreed a vulnerable customer 
repayment plan for Miss D which has been in place since March 2022. They said this will 
stop her account from being sold on. Theyve also confirmed that all the arrears on her 
account were removed on 3 March 2022. So, while her credit file will show there is a plan 
agreed, no arrears are reported. This feels fair to me as NewDay are required to accurately 
report where a plan is in place.
NewDay have provided evidence to show what theyve reported to the credit reference 
agencies. During our investigation, it was noticed that theyd reported the plan start date as 1 
July 2022 when it shouldve been March 2022. NewDay have confirmed this will be 
amended, which is what I would expect here.
Miss D is concerned that her credit score with the credit reference agencies appears to have 
deteriorated. Different businesses and agencies each use their own scoring systems which 
may interpret available information in different ways. Credit files rely on feeds from many 
different businesses including lenders and some utility companies. While I acknowledge 
Miss Ds concerns, I havent found anything that persuades me that any change in her credit 
standing would solely be as a result of anything NewDay did here. 
Ive gone on to consider whether NewDays resolution of Miss Ds complaints were 
appropriate together with the levels of compensation theyve paid. 
Compensation is a personal thing. What is seen as reasonable by one party may not be 
considered so by another. Miss D clearly did experience inconvenience in her dealings with 
NewDay and I appreciate her frustrations. But I think the amounts theyve paid feel fair in all 
the circumstances here and they appear to be in line with what I would expect. I appreciate that Miss D doesnt agree. But it isnt the role of this service to make awards in order to 
penalise NewDay for their mistakes. Any award is considered based upon the impact 
NewDays mistakes had upon Miss D. And I think the compensation already paid by 
NewDay does that here.
I think Miss Ds decision to be open with NewDay about her circumstances and ask for help 
was absolutely the right thing for her to do. I appreciate it wouldve been a difficult and 
worrying time for her. Its very unfortunate that NewDay made mistakes along the way. But I 
do think theyve since addressed those mistakes in an appropriate manner. I realise Miss D 
will be disappointed, but I wont be asking NewDay to do anything more here.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 December 2022.
