The complaint
Mr T complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Blue Motor Finance wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr T under a hire purchase agreement with Blue Motor 
Finance that he electronically signed in June 2019;
Blue Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality 
will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr T was nearly five years old, had been driven for about 
90,000 miles and had a price of £10,995;
Mr T says that there were a number of issues with the car, including with its engine 
management warning light, power, lights, brakes and gears, so he took the car to 
garages for repairs;
he complained to Blue Motor Finance about those issues in December 2019 but it 
said that his complaint was made more than six months after the car was supplied to 
him so he would need to provide evidence to show that the faults were present or 
developing when the car was supplied to him;
he then complained to this service but our investigator didnt recommend that his 
complaint should be upheld because he hadnt provided evidence to show that the 
faults were present or developing when the car was supplied to him;
the car was supplied to Mr T in June 2019 and I understand that its mileage was 
about 90,000 at that time, the car passed an MOT test in October 2019, about four 
months later, and its mileage was recorded as being 96,724  so in that time hed 
been able to drive more than 6,000 miles in the car;
the car also passed an MOT test in June 2020, a year after it had been supplied to 
Mr T, and at that time its mileage was 101,212  so in about a year hed been able to 
drive about 11,000 miles in the car;
Mr T has described the issues that hes had with the car  and I sympathise with him 
for those issues and the difficulties that theyve caused him  but Im not persuaded 
that hes provided enough evidence to show that those issues were present or 
developing when the car was supplied to him;
he was able to drive more than 6,000 miles in the car in four months between the car 
being supplied to him and it passing an MOT test in October 2019  and it must have 
been in a roadworthy condition at the time of that test or it wouldnt have passed it  
and Im not persuaded that its likely than hed have been able to drive that mileage in 
only four months if the car hadnt been of satisfactory quality, taking into account its 
age and mileage, when it was supplied to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr T  so I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Blue Motor Finance to allow him to 
reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint; and 
Mr T says that he understood that the rate of interest would be 16% but that the rate 
of interest shown in the agreement is 29.9% - but he electronically signed the 
agreement and accepted the terms that it contained  including the rate of interest  
and he agreed to make 60 payments of £276.70 for the car to be supplied to him and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the interest rate was 
misrepresented to him or that the agreement was mis-sold to him.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2020.
