The complaint
Mr N complains that CarCashPoint Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
What happened
Mr N was given a single loan by CarCashPoint. He borrowed £860 in September 2019 that 
he agreed to repay in 18 monthly instalments - £60 of that loan was used to pay the fees of 
the agent who visited Mr N to complete the loan paperwork. The loan is secured against 
Mr Ns vehicle. Shortly after taking the loan Mr N found it difficult to make his repayments 
and there are now significant arrears on his loan. But CarCashPoint has agreed to suspend 
any proceedings to repossess Mr Ns vehicle whilst his complaint is being considered by this 
Service.
One of our adjudicators has looked at Mr Ns complaint. She thought that the checks 
CarCashPoint had done before lending to Mr N had been proportionate. And she didnt think 
those checks suggested that Mr N wouldnt be able to repay the loan in a sustainable 
manner. So she didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld.
Mr N didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage of our 
process.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints on our website 
and Ive kept this in mind while deciding Mr Ns complaint.
The rules and regulations at the time CarCashPoint gave this loan to Mr N required it to 
carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of whether he could afford to repay 
what he owed in a sustainable manner. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an 
affordability assessment or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the credit sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse consequences for Mr N. In 
practice this meant that CarCashPoint had to ensure that making the repayments wouldnt 
cause Mr N undue difficulty or adverse consequences. In other words, it wasnt enough for 
CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it getting its money back, it had to 
consider the impact of any repayments on Mr N. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. 
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any repayments to credit from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet higher repayments from a particular level of income); 
the longer the period of time a borrower will be indebted for (reflecting the fact 
that the total cost of the credit is likely to be greater and the customer is required 
to make repayments for an extended period). 
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check 
shouldve been for a given application  including (but not limited to) any indications of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of 
this in mind when thinking about whether CarCashPoint did what it needed to before 
agreeing to lend to Mr N.
CarCashPoint gathered some information from Mr N before it agreed the loan. It asked him 
for details of his income, and his normal expenditure including the amount he was repaying 
to other creditors. And he provided around a months worth of bank statements so that 
CarCashPoint could check the information hed given about his income and expenditure.
Mr N was entering into a significant commitment with CarCashPoint. He would need to make 
monthly repayments for a period of 18 months, and he was using his car as security for the 
loan. So I would expect that CarCashPoint would want to gather, and independently check, 
some detailed information about his financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. 
I think that the checks CarCashPoint did achieved that aim and I would consider them to be 
proportionate in the circumstances of this loan.
But simply doing proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to react 
appropriately to what those checks show. So Ive looked at the information Mr N provided to 
CarCashPoint to see whether it was reasonable for him to be given this loan.
I have some concerns about whether CarCashPoint fully investigated the information Mr N 
provided. He has told us that his bank statements show he was making repayments each 
month to a credit union totalling around £275. I can see those amounts on his bank 
statements. But the repayments werent recorded on the expenditure information that 
CarCashPoint collected. And he has told us about other amounts that he isnt sure the 
lender fully considered.
I think it is reasonable that I take into account that Mr N himself signed the expenditure 
listing confirming it to be true and accurate. And without guidance from Mr N it is entirely 
reasonable that CarCashPoint might have not identified the two payments to the credit union 
that show on Mr Ns bank statements, as being regular loan repayments. But in any case, 
the disposable income that Mr N declared to CarCashPoint, and could be seen from his 
bank statements, would have suggested the loan was affordable even if the additional 
repayments to the credit union had been taken into account.
So I dont think the evidence from Mr Ns bank statements suggested that he would face 
problems repaying the loan from CarCashPoint in a sustainable manner. His bank 
statements dont show evidence of serious financial problems such as regular unpaid 
transactions or escalating levels of overdraft or other debt. So I dont think that what I consider to be proportionate checks should have led CarCashPoint to decline Mr Ns loan 
application.
I appreciate how disappointing my decision will be for Mr N. But, in summary I think the 
checks CarCashPoint did before agreeing this loan were proportionate and that they didnt 
show anything that should have led to the loan request being declined. So I dont think this 
complaint should be upheld.
Mr N has an outstanding balance on his loan that he has told us he is struggling to repay. 
That loan is secured against his vehicle. So I would encourage Mr N to get back in touch 
with CarCashPoint to discuss how the loan might be repaid. And I would remind 
CarCashPoint that it should treat Mr N fairly, with forbearance, and with due consideration in 
those discussions.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold the complaint or make any award against 
CarCashPoint Limited
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
