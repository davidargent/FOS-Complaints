The complaint
Mr H complains about a default that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter
(RateSetter) have placed on his credit file for non-payment of a loan.
What happened
In August 2018 following a house sale, Mr H says he contacted RateSetter to confirm the
settlement figure to repay the loan amount in full. It was confirmed that the online settlement
figure was correct, and no additional charges would be incurred due to early repayment.    
Mr H paid the loan in full on 17 August 2018.
Mr H applied for a mortgage in February 2021, and during this process was told there was a
default on his credit file relating to the RateSetter loan. When querying this with RateSetter
they explained the outstanding amount of £545 was owed due to a system error. They said
theyd made numerous attempts over several months to prompt Mr H to contact them about
the loan arrears without success. RateSetter said they emailed, text, called and sent letters,
but as Mr H didnt respond the account was defaulted in December 2018 and Mr Hs credit
file was updated to reflect this.
Mr H complained to RateSetter as he says he never updated his address with them when he
moved, as he didnt feel the need to as the loan was fully repaid. So, he never would have
received the letters RateSetter sent. Mr H doesnt dispute receiving emails or text messages
but he thought they were promotional offers, and so he deleted them.
RateSetter partially upheld Mr Hs complaint due to the system not calculating his payment
correctly. They offered Mr H a reduction of 20% of the settlement figure, but they werent
willing to remove the default as they felt this had been applied correctly.
Mr H didnt accept RateSetters offer. He was willing to pay the outstanding arrears, but he
felt the default had been applied unfairly and needed to be removed. One of our
investigators considered Mr Hs complaint, and concluded RateSetter had applied the default
correctly, as theyd also left Mr H voicemails which specifically explained they needed Mr H
to call them. But the investigator didnt think RateSetter went far enough in compensating Mr 
H for the trouble and upset caused  so he recommended RateSetter increase the discount 
off the outstanding arrears to £200.
Neither RateSetter nor Mr H agreed with the outcome. RateSetter felt the 20% discount 
theyd already applied was fair, and Mr H commented that his mobile doesnt and hasnt ever 
had a voicemail facility. So, the case has been passed to me to consider.
I issued my provisional findings on 11 February 2022. This is what I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute that there was a system error caused by RateSetter which meant Mr H fell
into arrears. Mr H also doesnt dispute that hes liable for the repayment of the arears. What I
need to consider is the action RateSetter took to rectify the error, and whether they acted
fairly in applying the default to Mr Hs credit file.
RateSetter say they sent letters, emails and text messages and made calls to Mr H as well
as leaving voicemails, trying to prompt him to make contact with them about the arrears,
prior to applying a default to his account.
Letters
Mr H says when he moved home, he didnt update RateSetter with his new address details
as he didnt feel this was needed as he was under the impression hed repaid the loan in full.
He had no need for RateSetter to send him letters, as the relationship with them had
terminated. I think its fair to say Mr H cant be held responsible for not replying to the letters
RateSetter sent.
Calls and voicemails
Ive asked RateSetter for copies of the calls and voicemails they say they left for Mr H. But
due to the amount of time thats passed, they say they dont have copies of these anymore.
So, I cant say for certain what was said on the calls or what messages were left requesting
Mr H to call them about the outstanding arrears. Mr H also says he doesnt and hasnt ever
had a voicemail facility on his phone. Therefore, Im not persuaded that RateSetter can rely
on the fact that they say they called and left voicemails for Mr H to contact them, as
justification for the default.
Texts and emails
Mr H settled the loan in August 2018. RateSetter first contacted Mr H about the outstanding
amount by text and email in December 2018, and I can confirm the mobile number and email
address they used was the same as the one we have on file for Mr H. Ive seen the texts and
emails, and the content and purpose of the texts and emails were clear  that he needed to
contact them as a matter of urgency about the loan. Therefore, I would have expected this to
have prompted Mr H to contact RateSetter to discuss his account as they requested.
Mr H didnt contact RateSetter, despite all their efforts and therefore the account was
defaulted. Im satisfied RateSetter did all they could based on the contact information they
had, to make Mr H aware there was a problem with the loan account, and for Mr H to have
acted on this. Therefore, Im satisfied the default has been applied correctly and fairly.
RateSetter, as a responsible lender, has a duty to ensure they report accurate information to 
credit reference agencies. So, it would be unreasonable to ask them to remove information
that was applied correctly and information they had a duty to report.
However, I do think Mr H has suffered a level of inconvenience because of the RateSetter
system error. Once Mr H had settled the loan in August 2018, he was under the impression
that the debt had been repaid in full. It wasnt until RateSetter first chased Mr H for the
outstanding debt by text and email in December 2018, that Mr H was reasonably made
aware that there was an outstanding amount on the loan that needed to be paid  and Mr H
should have acted on this information.
But as well as getting an online settlement figure, Mr H also says he called RateSetter to
confirm the online settlement figure was correct and that no early repayment fees or charges
would be incurred. RateSetter say they dont have any record of Mr H calling them to check
the settlement figure, but I have no reason to doubt what Mr H says. So, I think its
reasonable for Mr H to have relied on the settlement figure he obtained to be true and
accurate.While I agree that RateSetter applied the default fairly, I dont think they took steps to put
things right as quickly as they could have. It wasnt until four months after Mr H was under
the impression hed settled the loan that RateSetter first contacted him about the arrears.
This would have caused Mr H some distress that he wasnt made aware sooner, and then
had to find the funds to clear the arrears at short notice. So, to compensate Mr H for the
upset caused in RateSetter not acting to put things right sooner, I think RateSetter should
pay Mr H £100 compensation for the upset caused, in addition to the 20% reduction of the
arears amount they have already offered.
RateSetter and Mr W had until 25 February to give me any further comments to consider.  
Mr H didnt respond. RateSetter responded and provided a copy of a voicemail recording 
they say they left Mr H about the arrears balance. RateSetter also explained that after Mr H 
settled the loan on 17 August 2018, they werent notified that the monthly direct debit for 
August failed until 20 August 2018. So, the August arrears wasnt included in the settlement 
figure.
RateSetter said they text and emailed Mr H on 20 August 2018 to make him aware of the 
arrears. And this showed their communication with Mr H wasnt delayed. They also said hat 
December 2018 wasnt the first time theyd made contact with him about the outstanding 
amount.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the information RateSetter have given me following my provisional findings, 
but it doesnt change my decision. Ill explain why.
The recording provided by RateSetter (sent following my provisional findings) evidencing the 
voicemail they left Mr H does add weight to their argument that they made numerous 
attempts to get Mr H to contact them about the arrears. But as Ive already made a finding 
that Mr H should have acted on the attempts RateSetter made to get him to contract them 
about the arrears sooner - this doesnt change my decision. 
As I said in my provisional findings, RateSetter havent shown me that they made any 
attempt to contact Mr H about the outstanding settlement balance until December 2018.  I 
note RateSetter say they contacted Mr H by email and text about the arrears as soon as 
they became aware of the outstanding arrears on 20 August 2018. However, Ive considered 
how close in proximity this date is to when Mr H settled the loan on 17 August 2018. So, its 
not unreasonable for Mr H to have assumed the contact from RateSetter was a crossover of 
communication, and was in relation to the settlement balance, which he believed hed settled 
in full three days before. 
Im persuaded that the first time Mr H would have been aware there was a problem with the 
settlement was when RateSetter made contact in December 2018. And given the fact 
RateSetter, by their own admission, were aware in August 2018, I think they could have 
done more to contact Mr H about the arrears sooner.
With this in mind, for the reasons Ive explained, my final decision remains the same as my 
provisional decision.
Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter should pay Mr H £100 compensation for the 
inconvenience caused and honour the 20% reduction of the arears balance.My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding this complaint. I require Retail Money Market Ltd 
trading as RateSetter to pay Mr H £100 compensation for the inconvenience caused and 
honour the 20% reduction of the arears balance.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
