K820x#14complaint
Mrs C complained about fees and charges applied to her account  by National Westminster 
Bank Plc. She said she applied for a loan to consolidate her debts, but the bank wouldnt 
lend to her. And she said that she was facing financial difficulties now because of the 
charges shed paid.
background
Mrs C said that shed  been given a packaged bank account by NatWest back  in 2002, when 
she needed to change her account  from a joint to a single account. She said that wasnt  
suitable for her. NatWest  has agreed with that, and it has made  sizeable refunds. Its paid 
her back  £3,182.16 in fees it charged  for having that account,  plus interest. Its also paid her 
back £257.19, which is made up of lending fees and interest which was only applied 
because shed paid charges to have a packaged  bank  account.
Mrs C says that she should also have a refund of all the fees and charges applied  to her 
account. That would presumably include  fees for the lending  on her account, and charges for 
unpaid items. NatWest says it wont pay that back. 
Mrs C says that shes in financial hardship, and has been for a while. NatWest says that she 
hasnt told it this before,  but now it knows about this, it has offered to help her. 
Mrs C also said shed applied for loans, which wouldve helped, but NatWest wouldnt lend to 
her. NatWest says she made four loan applications in 2011, but she didnt meet  its lending 
criteria at the time. 
This complaint deals  with issues from 2002  onwards.  Our service cant usually look at issues  
as old as this, but NatWest has confirmed it agrees to our service considering these matters.
Our adjudicator didnt  think this complaint should be upheld. She said that NatWest had 
already refunded some charges. She thought the remaining fees and charges were a fair 
reflection of the activity on the account, and had been applied  in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account. So she didnt  think NatWest  had to pay those back.
Our adjudicator said that banks are entitled  to decide who they lend to. Our service wouldnt 
interfere with NatWests  decision  not to offer a loan to Mrs C.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that just applying  for a loan shouldve  put NatWest  on notice that 
Mrs C was in financial difficulties. And although she knew that Mrs C had complained about 
other issues before,  she couldnt see that Mrs C had told NatWest  about her financial 
difficulties before now. NatWest had now been  told, and it had offered to help, as our 
adjudicator would expect. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think that NatWest had been  unreasonable. 
Mrs C didnt agree. She said she had to resort to short term loans each month  just to make 
ends meet. And she sent us evidence of what she was being charged each month for her 
overdraft. She said it wasnt fair to charge these amounts, and not give this back,  when 
NatWest had got things wrong from the start. 
Ref: DRN00126712Mrs C also said that she suffers from disabilities which include memory loss, so she is in a 
vulnerable position. She said that NatWest  had only just started to send texts when charges 
were due, but she felt shed been disadvantaged  for years.  
Our adjudicator said NatWest had only started to offer a text message service  more recently, 
so she hadnt  missed out on something that other  people were getting. Mrs C then wrote 
again to say she didnt think that NatWest had supported  her, as a disabled person. She said 
shed been disadvantaged from the start, and its practices further increased her distress.  
Because Mrs C and our adjudicator didnt agree, this case  was passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
as our adjudicator.  
Mrs C said that the packaged  bank accounts  that NatWest sold her werent suitable for her. 
NatWest has agreed with that. It doesnt  think it shouldve charged  Mrs C a monthly  fee for 
her account.  So it paid back all of those monthly  fees. It paid Mrs C extra  interest, calculated  
at 8%, on all the money shed paid just to have that particular type of bank account. And it 
looked through her statements, to see if shed ever gone over her overdraft limit, or been 
charged overdraft interest, because  shed paid to have a bank account  instead of having  a 
fee free account. It paid her back  all those fees as well. And it added  extra  interest to that 
too. 
NatWest has told us it doesnt think that a packaged  bank account  was suitable for Mrs C. 
She was clearly a vulnerable customer at the time that the account was opened, and had 
only just left a violent relationship. To make  up for that, NatWest has provided a full refund of 
all the money she paid to have  this account, with interest on top.
Mrs C also complained about the fees and interest shed been charged for lending. This is a 
different part of her complaint. NatWest wouldve  charged Mrs C for lending to her, even if 
shed had a fee free bank  account.
NatWest doesnt  think  it did anything wrong by charging Mrs C to borrow money. It says that 
its checked, and it only charged her what it was entitled to charge, under the terms of her 
account. Our adjudicator also checked, and she thought the same.  I havent seen anything  
to make me think thats wrong. 
I think that NatWest is allowed to charge Mrs C for lending her money.  Its terms and 
conditions say that it will. So it doesnt  have  to pay that money back.  
Mrs C said that it wouldve been better  if NatWest  had given her a loan, so she could pay the 
money back that way. I understand  why Mrs C wanted to consolidate her debts in this way. 
But banks take their own decisions about  who they lend money to. Our service wont usually  
interfere with that. I dont  think  that NatWest had to offer Mrs C a bank loan.
Mrs C also says that NatWest has discriminated against her, and failed to support her as a 
disabled person. Ive seen  nothing  to suggest NatWest has treated Mrs C differently to 
anyone else. 
Ref: DRN00126713Banks have to take positive steps  to support  people with disabilities. And of course,  if there 
was any indication that NatWest had disregarded something Mrs C had told it about  her 
disabilities, that would be wrong. But that doesnt  seem to be whats  happened here. Theres  
no suggestion from the banks records that Mrs C told it of her disabilities or gave it her 
permission to keep  a record of them. So I dont think NatWest has unfairly  failed to support 
Mrs C as a disabled person. The available evidence is that it just didnt know.
Mrs C told us that NatWest has just recently started to send her text messages when shes  
about to be charged. She says this is helpful,  but she thinks  it shouldve been  done some 
time ago. NatWest said that this was an opt-in service, which  Mrs C had set up herself. Mrs 
C had been getting some text alerts since 2009. It said that she could opt in for more alerts  if 
shed find that helpful.
Ive looked at this complaint carefully, and I think NatWest did make  a mistake when it sold 
Mrs C a fee paying bank account. Im glad to see it has paid her back  everything that cost 
her, with interest. I dont think that NatWest has done anything else wrong here,  so I dont  
think it has to do more  than that now.
I know that Mrs C will be disappointed, but I dont think  her complaint should be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 November 2019.
