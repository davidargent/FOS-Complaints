K821x#15complaint
Miss O complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) gave her loans that 
she couldnt afford to repay. She asks that Quick  Quid refunds interest, writes off any 
balance and pays compensation for her upset,  with interest on the full amount.
background
Miss O took out six loans  and several top ups with Quick Quid  between  December 2013 and 
June 2018. Miss O says she struggled to meet bills and general living costs and cant  now 
get a mortgage because  of the impact  on her credit rating. She says this has caused her 
stress.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. She said Quick  
Quid shouldnt have  offered loan 2 and the last top up of loan 3 to Miss O. The adjudicator  
said the repayments were  a significant  proportion of Miss Os income and Quick Quid should 
have been aware  Miss O couldnt repay the loans sustainably. 
Our adjudicator said Quick Quid should  have made further checks before offering some  of 
the other loans or top ups. But we didnt have  evidence that, if it had, it would have  known 
the loans werent  affordable.
Quick Quid didnt agree. It said Miss O repaid the loans over three months with the largest  
payment at the end. So she had the surplus  from previous months  to put towards the loan 
repayment. It said Miss O hadnt provided evidence that the loans werent affordable.  Quick 
Quid provided more  information  about  its lending process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Miss O took out six loans  with Quick Quid.  Ive included a table with details of these at the 
end of this decision.
Before offering these  loans to Miss O, Quick Quid  needed to take reasonable steps  to 
ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means that it should have carried  out 
proportionate checks to make sure Miss O could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Os income  and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate. 
loans 1 and 2:
When she applied for loan 1, Miss O told Quick Quid her monthly income was about £1,080. 
I think the checks made by Quick  Quid were proportionate for loan 1. I dont think it had any 
reason to think the loan repayment wasnt affordable.
Ref: DRN56349412But I dont think Quick  Quid should have offered loan 2 to Miss O. The last repayment  (£540) 
was a significant proportion of Miss Os stated income. Miss O had extended loan 1 twice 
and she asked for loan 2 about a month after she repaid loan 1. This suggests she was 
having difficulty managing her money.  
Quick Quid says loan 2 was repayable over three months with the largest payment at the 
end. It says Miss O could use surplus income from the first two months  towards the loan 
repayment. I dont  think,  in the circumstances, this is reasonable. If the repayments were  
averaged over the three  months Miss O would have  had to pay (or save)  about £240 each 
month. This was more  than the repayment  for loan 1 (of £180) that she appeared to struggle 
with. I dont think the circumstances here suggest  Miss O was in a position  to put this 
amount of money  aside each month.  
I think Quick Quid should have realised Miss O was borrowing to cover the gap in her 
finances left by repaying loan 1. I think it should have known it was unlikely Miss O would be 
able to repay loan 2 sustainably.
loan 3:
There was a break of about 10 months between  Miss O repaying loan 2 and taking out 
loan 3 in April 2015. I think this was enough time for Quick Quid to reasonably  believe any 
problem with Miss Os finances  had improved. Miss O told Quick  Quid her monthly  income 
was about £1,080 and her monthly outgoings were £425. I think the checks  made by Quick  
Quid were proportionate for loan 3 and the first two top ups. I dont think  it had any reason  to 
think the repayments werent affordable.
However, I dont think Quick Quid should  have offered the third top up to Miss O in May 
2015. The repayment of £471  due in June was a significant portion of Miss Os stated 
income. Shed incurred  a late fee in April 2015. And she took out loan 3 and three top ups 
within a month. This suggests she was having difficulty  managing  her money.
I think Quick Quid should have known it was unlikely  Miss O could  meet the repayments for 
loan 3 plus the three top ups sustainably.
Loans 4 to 6:
Miss O repaid loan 3 in June 2015  and took out loan 4 in early 2018. Given the time that had 
passed since her previous  loan, I think it was reasonable for Quick Quid to assume any 
problems with Miss Os finances  had been  resolved.
Miss O told Quick  Quid her monthly income was £1,400 and her monthly outgoings were 
£375. I think the checks made by Quick Quid were proportionate  for loans 4 to 6. I dont  think 
it had any reason to think the repayments  werent affordable.
What happens  now?
Im upholding Miss Os complaint about loan 2 and the third top up of loan 3. Quick Quid 
should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss O paid on loan 2 and the third top up of loan 3;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN56349413remove any adverse information  about  loan 2 and the third top up of loan 3 from 
Miss Os credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss O a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold parts of Miss Os complaint. I order  CashEuroNet UK LLC to 
take the steps and pay the compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 July 2019.
