At the time of writing this decision loans 11, 15,16 and 17 remain outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he didnt seem to be managing his finances and seemed 
to be dependent on this type of borrowing. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Cs 
complaint from loan 12 onwards. The offer was put to Mr C, but he didnt accept it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
 
 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr C 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making any 
findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 5 to Mr C and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Cs fifth loan in just over three weeks, I think 
Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Cs finances before 
lending him this loan. 
Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that, as well as having loans 3 and 4 still outstanding with itself, Mr C was borrowing from 
another short-term lender and the repayments for all these loans were increasing his 
monthly outgoings. And this was most likely an indication that he was in a cycle of debt and 
was further borrowing to cover the hole that repaying his previous loans was leaving in his 
finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 13. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out 13 loans in just over nine months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Mr Cs first loan was for £100 and loan 13 was for the same amount. By now, Sunny 
ought to have know that it was unlikely that Mr C was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 13 onwards Mr C was provided with a new loan within days of taking out a 
previous one. Loans 13 to 17 were taken out over the space of 18 days. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 17 
was taken out four months after his first. Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 13 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint about loans 5 to 17 and Sunny should put things right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr C towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by Mr C 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr C as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr C having made 
overpayments then Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr C. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr C. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) Sunny should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to 
loans 5 to 12. The overall pattern of Mr Cs borrowing for loans 13 to 17 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely 
from Mr Cs credit file. Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Cs 
credit file until these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
 
 
 
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
