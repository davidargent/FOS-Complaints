Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Bs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few loans with Sunny as well as other short-
term lenders. Sunny  disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Bs complaint from loan 19 onwards. 
It later said it would uphold loans 5 to 21 but the offer wasnt  in-line with our general 
approach. The offer was put to Mr B who rejected it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN83165752Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr B 
didnt respond  to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute about these loans, I 
wont be making any findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Mr B and the results of these  checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Bs fifth loan in five months and he had three 
previous loans still outstanding, I think Sunny should have been looking to build  a clearer  
picture about Mr Bs finances before lending him this loan. 
Ref: DRN83165753Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that Mr B was borrowing from other short-term lenders as well as having out-standing loans 
with Sunny itself.  And although  the repayments  for these loans were  relatively  low, they 
would have been increasing  his monthly  outgoings. 
Also, the fact Mr B had other borrowing from short-term lenders,  combined with the fact he 
had overlapping borrowing is likely to have been  an indication  that he was having problems 
managing his money and Sunny ought to have  had concerns about that. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised Mr B was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr B had taken out 6 loans within less than six months.  So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 21 was taken 
out 13 months after his first. Mr B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 6 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Bs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Bs credit file;
any information recorded about  loan 6 is adverse. So, all entries about loan 6 should 
be removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN83165754Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
