The complaint
A company which Ill refer to as O complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA
(PayPal) didnt provide it with the requested information to locate a missing payment, which
caused a financial loss.
The complaint is brought on its behalf by its director, Ms G.
What happened
O told us:
It received a payment on 13 June 2022 into its PayPal account, and on 20 June, 
requested a withdrawal from this account of £1,867.99 to the registered bank account 
details held by PayPal, which had been input by a relative of Os director (the 
representative) - but the funds werent received as expected.
The representative identified on 13 July that the account details which had been input 
to receive the payment was incorrect by a couple of digits. So, they amended the 
account details for O held on the PayPal system. The same day a dispute was raised 
with PayPal that the funds hadnt been received.
PayPal didnt respond until 20 July and only said that the funds had been received by 
Os bank and provided a Faster Payment ID (FPID) reference. O provided this to the 
bank, but it said the payment couldnt be traced using this information.
It contacted PayPal again on 23 July, 27 July and 29 July and requested the account 
details that the funds had been transferred to, but it didnt receive a response.
PayPal told us:
O hadnt made them aware that the account information it had input on their system 
was incorrect and changed this online without notifying them. When O had contacted 
them, to say the payment hadnt been received, it had provided the correct account 
number  not the one it had initially input and where the payment had been received 
into.
If O had contacted its bank and provided the incorrect account information which it 
had input on their system, the bank may have been able to recover the funds. They 
had also provided the account details to which the missing funds had been credited 
to on 15 July 2023.
They werent responsible for the missing funds as they had been paid to the account 
details that O had input, confirmed as being received by the bank and subsequently 
withdrawn.
Our investigator recommended the complaint be upheld. He said it was likely that O had
input the incorrect account number for PayPal to transfer the funds to. However, if PayPal
had provided the required account information at the time O had made them aware the
payment hadnt been received, its likely the receiving bank could have located the payment
and returned it. Instead, by the time this was provided, the balance had been withdrawn  so
the investigator thought PayPal should refund the full payment of £1,867.99.
PayPal didnt agree. They said that O hadnt said theyd input the wrong account number,
and the subsequently changed this, and if theyd made the bank aware of this, it may have
been able to recover the funds.
I issued a provisional decision on 18 August 2023. I said the following: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive decided to 
uphold it. However, unlike our investigator I dont think PayPal are solely responsible 
for Os loss. Ill explain why.
O says that PayPal didnt provide the account details that the payment had been 
made to despite numerous requests in July 2023. It says that had PayPal provided 
this information more quickly, its payment could have been returned so PayPal 
should refund it. But I dont agree. I say that because Ive seen evidence that it was 
O who input the incorrect account details on the system where the missing funds 
were credited to - rather than an initial error by PayPal.
I recognise that O says it wasnt aware of the incorrect account details, or the 
subsequent correction when the error was identified, and a dispute raised with 
PayPal. However, these details and changes were input by Os representative  who 
had been given permission on the companys behalf to do so. Ive also seen that 
when the fund withdrawal request was submitted to PayPal, an alert was provided to 
say that the payment would be credited to Os account within minutes. However, the 
withdrawal was requested on 20 June, and it wasnt until 13 July that O checked the 
account details and identified they were incorrect  nearly a month later.
O says PayPal could have provided the bank details sooner  and I agree thats the 
case. However, I do also need to consider that when O logged into the PayPal 
system to change the account details, it would also have seen the incorrect account 
number. So even if it hadnt known there was an error prior to this, from 13 July 
onwards, it could have made the third-party and PayPal aware they had made a 
mistake so a dispute could be raised. So I think O could have done more to mitigate 
its losses here.
PayPal says that they are not responsible for Os losses as it was the company that 
input the incorrect bank details for the funds to be withdrawn into. Its not disputed by 
either party that O made an error with the account details initially, however I think 
PayPal could also have done more here to help the company recover its funds.
Ive seen that O contacted PayPal on 13 July to say that the funds hadnt been 
received. At that time, PayPal provided a reference number which they believed the 
third-party bank would be able to use to locate the payment. I think this was 
reasonable. However, O then contacted PayPal on 20 July, 23 July, 27 July, and 29 
July to tell them that the third-party bank couldnt locate the account using this 
reference, and needed the account details the payment had been paid into.
Ive seen that PayPal didnt respond to these requests and didnt investigate/request 
return of payment until 6 October 2022 when this service became involved. So I think 
PayPals actions have, at least in part, prevented O getting its funds returned. However, this doesnt change the fact that Os representative knew the account 
details were wrong and had the account number that the payment had been credited 
to before O had contacted PayPal on 13 July to raise the dispute and again on 27 
July when it claimed the payment hadnt been received into its own account  which 
it, or at least its representative knew - wasnt the case.
PayPal told us that despite numerous requests, the third-party bank didnt respond 
within the deadline so theyve done what they can to try and recover Os funds. Both 
of these parties have a difference of opinion about when contact was made between 
them - but Im not persuaded that makes a difference here. I say that because the 
third-party bank told us that it could only have ring-fenced the money incorrectly 
received by its customer for two months  which means it would have needed to do 
this before 20 August. So it couldnt simply return Os money after this point  even if 
there was a credit balance held in the receiving account.
Ive also seen guidance from the UK banking sectors digital network provider which 
confirms this is the case  after two months, the funds can still be recovered but only 
if the person(s) who received the funds in error gives authority for them to be debited 
from their account. As the third-party bank hasnt been able to obtain this from its 
customer, O would now need to take legal action to recover their money. Ive seen 
statements of the receiving account which show there was sufficient funds held in the 
account in August and September. So I think its likely that had PayPal looked to 
recover this when O contacted them on 20 July, the company wouldve had a greater 
chance of getting its money returned.
Based on what Ive seen, I think both O and PayPal have both contributed to the loss 
of funds here. However, I think O already had the information that it needed to 
request the return of the payment when it contacted PayPal so for that reason, I dont 
think PayPal should refund O for the missing payment. But its clear PayPal caused O 
inconvenience by not responding to its emails, and not attempting recovery of Os 
payment until several months later. So I think PayPal should pay O £300 for the 
inconvenience caused.
I invited O and PayPal to give me any more evidence and information they wanted me to 
consider before issuing my final decision. PayPal accepted the decision and had nothing 
further to add. O didnt accept the decision. It said in summary:
It doesnt agree that O had the information needed to request the return of the 
payment and asked for clarity over the evidence provided by PayPal.
Its unreasonable to expect O to record what the incorrect details were, when it 
should have only had to worry about ensuring the correct information was input. It 
doesnt feel O should have known those details were required for its funds to be 
recovered.
Neither PayPal or the receiving bank were helpful in recovering the money, and it 
believes it was reasonable for PayPal to have sourced the receiving account details 
more quickly. 
Its unhappy with the amount of compensation payable and believes PayPals lack of 
response led to it not receiving its funds back, so it should bear a greater 
responsibility for the loss. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same conclusions as I did in my provisional decision, for 
the same reasons. I now confirm those provisional conclusions as final.
O says that it didnt have the account information which had been input correctly to request 
the return of the funds, nor should it have known these details would be required to return 
the payment. It also requests further information on the evidence provided by PayPal. As a 
service, we're governed by rules set by the industry regulator, the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). They're called the DISP rules and can be found in the FCA's handbook. 
These rules set out how we approach complaints, in this case DISP rule 3.5.9(R) allows me 
to accept information in confidence where I consider it appropriate to do so. 
In this case, the information provided by PayPal shows that when O logged into the PayPal 
system, it would have clearly seen the account details which it had entered originally. These 
details differed from Os account number slightly, so I think it would have been clear to O 
when it looked at this, that it had made an error when it had added the details originally. Due 
to nature of the information provided by PayPal, I wont be providing a copy of this evidence 
to O, but Im satisfied that it would have clearly seen this information. 
I recognise Os comments that PayPal could have done more here to assist it  and I have 
taken this into account when making an award for the inconvenience caused from the 
company having to chase for a response. However, I dont agree that PayPal should be 
more liable than O, given that the company input the details incorrectly in the first place. O 
was also aware that it should have received the payment within minutes  given that it 
received confirmation of this from PayPal when making the withdrawal. Instead it waited over 
a month to raise a dispute with PayPal, and when it did so, it didnt make them aware it had 
input an incorrect account number. Even if it hadnt made a record of the actual account 
number, I think it would have been reasonable for O to make PayPal aware this was the 
issue, so they could have provided more accurate information on the original request.
I understand why O believes PayPal is more responsible for this and that the compensation 
paid isnt enough. But after considering all the information from both parties, I am 
recommending PayPal pay O £300 for the inconvenience caused by not responding to its 
enquiries in a timely manner - as I dont think PayPal is responsible for the financial loss and 
related impact that O believes is the case.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
pay O £300 for the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 October 2023.
