K820x#14complaint
Ms H has complained about several things to do with her current account with National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest). In particular, shes said NatWest incorrectly  recorded  her 
as deceased;  they wrongly  said shed only had her account with NatWest  since 2011  and 
there were problems relating to the debit card and Personal  Identification Number (PIN) 
associated with the account.
background
Ms H has said that following the death  of her mother abroad in early  2018, someone 
obtained her mothers  death certificate  (which she says she still doesnt  have).  Ms H says 
this person then approached various organisations/ businesses  to say that Ms H had passed 
away. 
Ms H has explained  that, apart from her middle  name, she shared the same first and last 
name as her mother which she believes has in part caused the problem. During the course 
of her submissions Ms H has also mentioned her divorce from her ex-husband and problems 
with how her name had been recorded  on the divorce papers (although from what Ms H tells 
us, this now appears to have been sorted out). 
Ms H has said because  of these problems NatWest wrongly  recorded  her as deceased on 
her account.  She says she saw a red flag to this effect associated  with her account.  And 
shes been worried that organisations have thought shes been impersonating her mother  
(whom she says has never  been  in this country). 
Ms H also disputes NatWests assertion that she opened her account  in 2011. She says she 
opened it in 2007. And I understand, having  listened  to various calls Ms H has had with our 
service, that because of the above she feels NatWest have been lying to her. 
Ms H has also said she believes she received a fraudulent  debit card. Theres a suggestion 
she didnt think the card was correct  because it wasnt  embossed.  She told us 
correspondence relating to the card/ PIN came from a bank in Scotland which  shes never  
had any accounts  with  so this has also worried her. And she also raised concerns that 
NatWest wouldnt accept  her passport as identification and that they werent recognising her 
as a British citizen.  
Our investigator didnt  uphold Ms Hs complaint. She explained NatWest had accepted a 
deceased marker had been recorded  in error on the account  although there  was no record  
of why this had happened. And she felt that NatWests offer of £100 to recognise this was 
fair in the circumstances. 
Our investigator also had no reason to believe a fraudulent card had been sent to Ms H. 
Rather that NatWest had changed the appearance  of their debit cards (so they were no 
longer embossed).  She also tried to explain that the card/  PIN could be sent by NatWest 
from various locations across the country  and the reference to the bank in Scotland  wasnt  
surprising as that bank is NatWests parent bank.  So our investigator didnt find that NatWest  
had done anything wrong here. Our investigator  also said there was nothing  to suggest  that 
NatWest had taken  the card away from Ms H  and they speculated  (in the absence  of any 
evidence) that it wouldnt be unusual for NatWest to have taken back a card if Ms H had 
raised concerns  about the card being  fake and so shed ordered  a new one. 
Ref: DRN33558912Our investigator also asked Ms H for any evidence  to suggest that NatWest wouldnt accept 
her passport  as NatWest  had no record of this being the case. And she said that NatWests 
internal records show  they are holding the correct  personal details for Ms H  including  her 
title, first name, middle name  and last name, as well as that Ms H is divorced and has a 
British nationality. So again, our investigator didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong 
here either. 
Ms H had also told our investigator  that NatWest hadnt responded to her complaint. But our 
investigator confirmed  NatWest had sent Ms H a final response letter (to the correct  
address) on 9 February 2019.  
my findings
Ms Hs submissions in relation to this complaint are lengthy and at times have been difficult  
to follow, as during  the course of this complaint Ms H has raised additional  points of 
complaint and talked  about other  organisations whom shes been having problems with. 
So, to be clear, the complaint that has been brought to us focuses on the concerns Ive 
referred to above  in the complaint section  and which have already been considered  by 
NatWest. Any other  concerns Ms H has outside  of the complaint points Ive noted here 
would now have to be dealt with separately. So, for example, Im afraid  the points Ms H has 
made about accounts or loans being  taken out by other people  in her name are not things I 
can consider as part of this decision.  
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, I am in agreement 
with the investigators  findings, for broadly the same reasons, that Ms Hs complaint should 
not be upheld.  
After looking through  all the available evidence and submissions, it seems NatWest agreed 
to give Ms H the benefit of the doubt and accept that at one point Ms Hs current account 
had a deceased marker on it. However,  NatWest are unable  to provide any evidence of a 
bank error  or explain why this may have happened. And in the absence  of any other  
evidence form either  NatWest or Ms H, Im therefore  also unable to say what  exactly  
happened. 
I do appreciate how distressing finding out such a marker existed on her account wouldve 
been for Ms H particularly  given she was already and understandably  upset about  the 
passing of her mother. So, I accept this wouldve been a difficult time for Ms H. However, 
without any clear evidence, I cant offer Ms H any explanation about what happened  so I can 
only look to see if things  were put right for Ms H when NatWest found  out about  the error.  
And it appears that things were put right and the marker removed. NatWest offered £100 to 
Ms H to apologise for the trouble caused. I think this was a fair offer in the circumstances 
and so Im not going to ask NatWest  to do any more here. 
Ms H strongly disagreed  with NatWests assertion that she had not held an account with 
NatWest until 2011. And she felt this therefore  showed NatWest was being  untruthful. 
Having reviewed the available evidence, screenshots from NatWests internal records  
support what NatWest have said in this regard. So, Im afraid I cant  agree with Ms Hs points 
here. 
Ref: DRN33558913Ms H says NatWest took her card from her. But the difficulty here is that theres  no evidence 
to support this is what happened. What  I can see from the evidence made available from 
NatWest is that new cards  and PINs were ordered  for Ms H and held at branch. And I note 
that NatWest have said a new card and PIN couldve been issued from different places. 
Ms H told us she refused  to collect them. And while a change  in the design of the cards  may 
have caused some confusion (in that the cards are now flat, so nothing  is embossed), 
theres not enough to suggest the cards/ PINs  being  arranged for Ms H were fraudulent. I 
therefore agree with our investigator  that NatWest havent done anything wrong here. And I 
dont uphold this part of Ms Hs complaint. 
Ms H talked to our service  about NatWest not accepting her passport as identification and 
not holding her correct  personal details. But Ive reviewed the internal  records  from NatWest 
and agree with the investigator  that NatWest holds the correct name for Ms H, together with 
a note that shes divorced and that her nationality is British. And theres nothing to suggest  
NatWest werent accepting or recognising  Ms Hs passport in branch. 
Our investigator invited  Ms H to provide evidence as to why she thought  they werent holding 
the right information  about her, but Ms H didnt provide anything further. I would also add 
that until Ms H accepts a new card and PIN, I dont think it would  be unusual for her to use 
the branch to carry out her banking needs instead, particularly if she chooses not to use any 
online or telephone banking facilities. And from what Ms H told us, shes  said her account 
isnt closed and theres  been no suggestion  from either party that Ms H has been unable to 
access her account. 
I also agree  with the investigator that NatWest responded to Ms Hs complaint in their final 
response letter. 
I really do appreciate that Ms H has wider concerns about how her daily life is being 
affected, seemingly stemming from the issues to do with her mothers death certificate. And I 
can only imagine the stress this has been causing Ms H as she tries to get to the bottom of 
whats happening  and tries to resolve things with various parties. But I must be clear that this 
decision has only dealt with whether NatWest has done anything wrong in relation to the 
original complaint points  that Ms H raised with us. While I appreciate Ms H may have  wished 
for a different  outcome  with regards to this complaint, given the evidence  and submissions 
Ive seen, Im not upholding  Ms Hs complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  above, my final decision is that Ms Hs complaint is not upheld. And 
NatWest should  pay Ms H the £100 as referred to above if they have not already done so.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
