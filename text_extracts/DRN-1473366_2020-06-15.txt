The complaint
Mis K complains that Mozo Bank Ltd gave her the wrong information before she paid money 
into a savings account. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Monzo Bank accepts it incorrectly told Miss K she could pay more into her savings 
pot after the account was opened. Monzo Bank has apologised for the mistake and 
paid Miss K Â£50. 
Monzo Bank didn't tell Miss K she could make withdrawals from the pot once it had 
been locked. 
Whilst Miss K wasn't able to pay in additional funds, Monzo Bank gave details of 
other interest paying accounts she could open to run along-side her fixed rate 
savings. 
I'm satisfied Monzo Bank has dealt with Miss K's complaint fairly, so I'm not telling it 
to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
