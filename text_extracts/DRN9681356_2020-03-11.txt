There was a sizeable break in lending between  loans 3 and 4 so Ive considered loan 4 
onwards as a new lending  chain.  
An adjudicator review Mr Ms complaint and said that Mr Lender wasnt  required to do any 
more when it gave  Mr M loans 1 and 2. However, she didnt think  Mr Lender  did enough 
when giving loans  3-9. This was because  the repayments represented a significant  
proportion of Mr Ms income. The adjudicator also upheld loan 9 due to repeat lending. 
Mr Lender didnt agree with the adjudicators review, but in response did make an offer on 
loans 5-9. This included a refund of all interest  and charges on the loans, as well as 8% 
interest. Mr M decided not to accept this offer. 
As no agreement could be reached  the case was passed to me  an ombudsman  for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Ref: DRN96813562the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loan  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Lender needed to do any more  when  it lent Mr M loans 1 and 
2.  Mr M didnt  disagree with this so I wont be making further  findings  on this loan, but I have 
considered it when looking at Mr Ms borrowing history and his financial situation overall.
Mr Lender says it carried out adequate checks on Mr M when he applied  for loan 3. This 
included getting  details of his income and expenditure. I can see from evidence submitted by 
Mr Lender that it did carry out checks on Mr M. However, I think  if Mr Lender had properly 
considered Mr Ms financial situation  and the lending I think  it would have seen that Mr M 
was not in a position  to take on this borrowing.
I say this because  Mr M was borrowing £350  and he had existing  credit  with Mr Lender 
which was still running. This meant that Mr Ms highest repayment  for loan 3 was £254.79.  
Given Mr M had a reported income of £800 and expenditure  of around £550  a month, this 
left Mr M with £250 disposable income. The loan repayment took away  Mr Ms disposable 
income, leaving him with no funds  for the rest of the month.  As the repayment  represented a 
Ref: DRN96813563significant proportion  of Mr Ms income, I think Mr Lender ought to have realised this and the 
potential for Mr M to struggle to make  the repayment.
Given Mr Ms income and borrowing, it seems there was a significant  chance of Mr M having 
to borrow again  to meet his commitment under this loan. Mr Lender was under a duty to 
ensure the lending could  be sustainably repaid and in Mr Ms case  I dont think it was. And I 
think this wouldve been clear to Mr Lender at the outset when it gathered  information from 
Mr M.
From loan 3 onwards Mr Ms borrowing increases  significantly  and by loan 5 he is borrowing 
around £1,000.  This continues until loan 9 and Mr M is taking  out these larger loans  over an 
extended period  of time, Looking at the upward trend it seems likely Mr M was taking out 
loans to help cover the gap previous loans left in his finances. 
Our adjudicator upheld  loan 9 for repeat lending. But I dont think enough of a pattern had 
been established just yet by Mr M. And as noted above, I think  Mr Lender  shouldve  been 
aware of the impact  the loans  would  have on Mr Ms finances based on his income. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 3 to 9 and Mr Lender should put things right.
putting things right  what PDL Finance Limited needs to do
Mr Lender shouldnt have  given Mr Ms loans 3 to 9.
A)Mr Lender  should  add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards  
interest, fees and charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third 
party where applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B)Mr Lender  should  calculate  8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  
by Mr M which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M 
originally made  the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Mr Lender  should  pay Mr M the total of A plus B.
D)Mr Lender  should  remove any adverse information  it has recorded on Mr Ms 
credit file in relation  to loans 3 to 9.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  Mr Lender should  give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its deducted,  if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint. PDL Finance Limited  should
pay put things  right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
