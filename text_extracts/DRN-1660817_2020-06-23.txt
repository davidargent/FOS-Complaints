The complaint
Mr F, on behalf of A, is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA suspended As PayPal 
account and card reader. Mr F says the timing of this was very unhelpful as he was at an 
important business conference when this happened. This resulted in a huge inconvenience 
and a substantial loss of money for A.
What happened
Mr F has told our service that a considerable amount of time had been spent before the 
business conference ensuring PayPal had been sent everything they needed to guarantee 
that it all went smoothly on the day. Mr F says, on the day of the business conference 
though, it became apparent that he was unable to use the PayPal account and card reader. 
Mr F says he spent a long time on the phone to PayPal trying to resolve this issue. PayPal 
however has said they have no record of this. PayPal considered this complaint but they 
didnt uphold it. They feel they were entitled, under the PayPal User Agreement, to 
temporarily suspend the account due to security measures they have in place. In light of 
PayPal not upholding this complaint, the case was referred to our service. 
An investigator has already looked at this matter. She didnt uphold this complaint for 
reasons already expressed by PayPal. As Mr F still remains unhappy, this complaint has 
now been passed to me to look at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I too think PayPal was entitled, under the PayPal User Agreement, to temporarily suspend 
the account due to security measures they have in place. PayPal has advised that 
sometimes it becomes necessary to stop a login or payment to maintain the account 
security. 
Im satisfied PayPal is able under the Agreement to suspend, block, limit, cancel or close an 
account if they feel it is reasonable to do so. This is a commercial decision and at the 
discretion of PayPal. This isnt something our service would interfere with. PayPal has 
explained that the reason the account was suspended is commercially sensitive. And Im 
afraid PayPal isnt required to disclose this information to us. 
There is a clear discrepancy between Mr F and PayPal as to the alleged contact made 
between the parties at the time of the business conference. Unfortunately Ive not seen 
anything to show Mr F made contact with PayPal on this date. 
DRN-1660817I do appreciate how frustrating this situation must be for Mr F. But Im afraid, based on 
everything Ive seen, I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F, on behalf of 
A, to accept or reject my decision before 23 July 2020.
