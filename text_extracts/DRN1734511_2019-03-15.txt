K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that Uncle Buck Finance LLP was irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr B had four loans  from Uncle  Buck between May 2015 and November 2015 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Scheduled  Repayments Repaid
1 11 May 2015 £250 19d 29 May 2015 1 x £288 29 May 2015
2 14 Jun 2015 £275 74d 28 Aug 2015 3 x £125.41 6 Jul 2015
3 5 Aug 2015 £900 86d 30 Oct 2015 3 x £438.72 6 Aug 2015
4 13 Oct 2015 £850 79d 31 Dec 2015 3 x £395.13 10 Nov 2015
Mr B says Uncle Buck lent to him repeatedly when he was already in financial difficulties. He 
says he had to take out other  loans  to make the Uncle Buck repayments causing his debt 
problems to spiral. Mr B says Uncle Buck should have seen the other  debts on his credit 
report.
Uncle Buck  says it asked  Mr B for information  about his income and expenditure and verified  
the income figure it received.  It also checked his credit record  and says there was nothing in 
the information that gave  it reason to decline the applications.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied Uncle 
Buck had done proportionate checks before approving all the loans and, based on the 
information it had, she didnt think Uncle Buck was wrong to lend to Mr B.
Mr B responded to say, in summary, that his pattern of borrowing was clear, with increasing 
loan amounts. He says Uncle  Bucks credit checks cannot have been sufficient as his other 
debts would have  shown on his credit report.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B 
and to Uncle Buck on 25 February 2019.  I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that Uncle Buck did enough  checks before approving loans  1 to 3, and 
that, based on the information it had, it found  the loans  to be affordable;
I considered Uncle  Buck should have done better checks before it approved loan 4, 
including asking  him whether he had any other short-term  loans;
I found that had Uncle  Buck carried out proportionate checks, its likely to have seen  
that Mr B borrowed almost £1,600 from two other short-term  lenders the day before 
he applied for loan 4;
I didnt consider Mr B could afford  to repay  loan 4 on top of his other  commitments  
and Uncle Buck should not have approved this loan.
Subject to any further representations by Mr B or Uncle Buck,  my provisional decision was 
that Uncle Buck should refund interest and charges  on loan 4 (plus 8% statutory interest)  
and remove any associated negative  information from Mr Bs credit file.
Mr B accepted the provisional decision.
Ref: DRN17345112Uncle Buck  responded to say, in summary,  that the provisional decision did not make  
specific reference to additional information it had already provided. Namely  that:
Mr B had applied for 16 loans,  of which only four were funded;
There was a gap of 67 days between loans 3 and 4;
It specifically asked  Mr B about his other  credit  commitments  when  confirming his 
expenditure;
When Mr B complained he said his income was £2,195  almost  £1,000  less than the 
income hed declared on his loan applications.  Uncle Buck says Mr B should have 
been asked for an explanation for this discrepancy;
Mr B said he was living with his parents, so his expenses did not appear 
unreasonable in that context;
The results of its credit check showed  no active short-term loans.
In response to the provisional decision, Uncle Buck  said:
It had now managed to locate  the MODA data (real time credit  updates)  from Mr Bs 
credit report;
This confirmed two short-term loans  were taken out in the last seven days, with an 
outstanding balance of £1,596;
Based  on Mr Bs disposable income of £2,262, the repayment of the £1,596 and the 
£400 instalment  due on loan 4, this still left Mr B with £266 to meet  unexpected 
expenses;
The above assumes the other short-term loans  were  due to be repaid in a single 
repayment which it says it considered  unlikely;
As Mr B repaid three of the loans early,  he was not borrowing  for 111 out of the 
183-day period.
So, in conclusion, Uncle Buck says it did carry out proportionate checks and the loan was 
affordable.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the additional information Uncle Buck provided, I only included information in 
the provisional decision that directly  contributed to the outcome. So, whilst  I accept  Uncle 
Buck only funded four of the loans for which Mr B applied, I needed to consider whether the 
four it approved had been funded appropriately.
I acknowledged the gap in borrowing between loans  3 and 4, but I did not consider such  a 
break should have  indicated  to Uncle Buck that this was a new loan chain. Indeed Mr B 
applied for a further loan on 4 September 2015, which he subsequently cancelled.
With regard to Mr B declaring  a different income  to Uncle  Buck when he complained, he did, 
in fact, declare  an income of £2,915, not £2,195. This is not significantly different to the 
£3,172 he declared in his applications and that was verified as reasonable by Uncle Buck.
Finally I broadly agree that Uncle  Buck was entitled to use the information provided by Mr B 
with regard to his expenses and I acknowledge  that his living arrangements did not make his 
expenditure seem unreasonable.
Ref: DRN17345113However, by the time it came to loan 4, I was not satisfied Uncle  Buck had done enough 
checks with regard to his short-term loans. I acknowledge Uncle  Buck asked for Mr Bs credit 
commitments, but I dont  find it specifically requested information about  short-term loans. 
Similarly, as discussed in the provisional decision,  due to the nature of short-term  borrowing 
and the length of time taken to update  credit  files, I dont consider these [credit]  checks went 
far enough.
I accept that Uncle Buck  has now said that, in fact, it did have real-time information  about Mr 
Bs other short-term commitments, and has now confirmed  a figure of £1,596 which  is in line 
with my findings. So, Im now satisfied  its checks for loan 4 did, indeed, go far enough.
However, I still dont find loan 4 was affordable  to Mr B. Although Uncle Buck  questions  
whether the £1,596 was all due to be repaid  the following month,  I can confirm that was the 
case. Both loans were  due to be repaid at the same time as the first instalment of loan 4 
and, in its response, Uncle  Buck  has failed  to include the interest on those  loans that Mr B 
also owed. In fact, Mr B needed  to repay  about £1,830 on those loans, which  left him with 
around £40 for unforeseen  expenses, as opposed to the £266 calculated  by Uncle Buck.
In conclusion, although I now accept that Uncle Buck carried out proportionate checks for 
loan 4, I still dont  consider  it should  have found  loan 4 to be affordable.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. Uncle Buck  Finance  LLP should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr B paid on loan 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 4 from Mr Bs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 April 2019.
