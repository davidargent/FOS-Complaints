K820x#14complaint
Miss K makes  a number of complaints about  her NewDay Ltd credit card. She complains 
that the account wasnt what she was expecting and about how NewDay has contacted  her 
about the outstanding  balance,
background
Miss K says she opened  the NewDay account but says its advertising  was confusing and the 
account wasnt what she was expecting.  She says she was unwell but NewDay kept 
contacting her but the caller was silent. Miss K says the contact was harassment and that 
she would  like the account balance written off and paid compensation.
NewDay accepts that its automated  telephone  does have a slight delay  before  its advisor  is 
able to speak  to a customer. But it says it did speak to Miss K and agreed to stop calls and 
explained how its calls were made to her and the delay in being able to speak. NewDay  says 
in April 2018 Miss K told it she would  clear the balance but now accepts it could have done 
more to offer assistance to her as she was unwell. Its offered to speak to Miss K about 
repaying the balance and has offered £50 compensation.
Miss K had brought  her complaint to us and our investigator thought NewDays  offer was fair 
and reasonable.  The investigator  thought  that Miss K had said she would repay NewDay  the 
money but that NewDay could have done more  to find out about her illness. The investigator  
thought Miss K had the benefit of the money  and so couldnt fairly tell NewDay to write off 
the balance. The investigator also didnt think waiting for us and NewDay to conclude  its 
investigation was a valid reason not to make a repayment and that Miss K should consider 
speaking to NewDay about the debt.
Miss K doesnt accept  that view and in summary  says she will be considering  court action 
against NewDay for failing to take into her account her illness and for its harassment of her. 
She says NewDays actions are discriminatory  and so she doesnt  accept  she owes it any 
money. Miss K would  like an apology,  the debt written off, and an explanation  for the 
calculation of the compensation. She would also like £1000 compensation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Miss K will be disappointed  by my decision and I 
appreciate how strongly she feels about this complaint.
Im satisfied that Miss K opened the NewDay account and that this wasnt an advised sale. I 
think Miss K made the decision to open  the account  and I cant fairly hold NewDay  
responsible for Miss K not understanding the terms and conditions of the account.
Im also satisfied that Miss K owes NewDay money  and doesnt appear to have ever made  a 
repayment. I can see from NewDays account notes that Miss K appeared to acknowledge 
the debt and said that she would  repay  it. I appreciate  that Miss K has health problems and I 
accept that being contacted about debts  in these sorts of circumstances is stressful.  But I 
also think that NewDay is entitled to contact a customer about an outstanding  debt.  So I 
agree with the investigator that NewDay should have explored Miss Ks illness with her and 
considered how it could help her. But Im satisfied  that NewDay  has apologised for this and 
has offered what I think is a fair and reasonable amount of compensation of £50.
Ref: DRN47506982I appreciate that Miss K would like the debt written off. But whilst Im sorry to disagree with 
her I cant  fairly order NewDay to do so. NewDay should treat cases of financial difficulty 
positively and sympathetically and I can see that its offered to speak to Miss K to try and 
resolve matters. Its of course a matter for Miss K if shes  prepared to speak to NewDay  but I 
dont think it can help her if she doesnt.
Overall I dont think NewDay  should  write off the account balance as Miss K says it should. I 
can see that Miss K says shes considering  court  action so I will leave it to her to decide if 
she wishs  to accept the compensation.  I should make it clear  that it would be for a court and 
not us to decide if there had been  discrimination or harassment. Im satisfied that NewDay 
explained that its telephone systems  had a short delay  before the parties could hear and 
speak to each  other.  And for the reasons Ive explained Im satisfied NewDay was entitled  to 
speak to Miss K and try and find out why agreed  payments were not being made.
I dont think NewDays actions justify  paying  compensation  of £1,000.  And Ive explained 
why I think the offer its made is fair and reasonable.
my final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd has made a fair and reasonable offer of £50 
compensation. Miss Ks acceptance of that offer would be in full and final settlement of this 
complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 July 2019.
