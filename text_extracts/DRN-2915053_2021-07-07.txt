The complaint
Mr M is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, are reporting a late payment marker
on his credit file.
  
What happened
Mr M received an email from PayPal on 5 April 2020 which explained that hed missed a
payment that was due on his PayPal credit account. Mr M contacted PayPal and was told
that in fact it was the previous months payment  March 2020 - that had been missed, and
that this was because the direct debit had been returned unpaid. PayPals advisor explained
to Mr M that he could make the payment now and that there would be no impact on his credit
file, and so Mr M made the outstanding payment over the phone.
 
Shortly afterwards, Mr M became aware that PayPal were reporting a late payment on his
credit file. Mr M wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
 
PayPal looked at Mr Ms complaint, but they felt that they had followed the correct process
following the March 2020 payment not being received, including reporting a late payment to
the credit reference agencies. So, they didnt uphold the complaint.
 
Mr M wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this. They noted that the funds needed to honour the
payment had been available in Mr Ms bank account at that time that the March direct debit
was due. So, they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mr Ms favour and that
PayPal should remove the adverse reporting from Mr Ms credit file.
 
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 3 June as follows:
 
It must have been understandably frustrating for Mr M to learn that the March 2020 
direct debit payment hadnt been successful, especially given that he had the 
necessary funds in place to ensure that the direct debit would be paid.
 
However, when PayPal applied for the direct debt at the beginning of March, they were 
unsuccessful, and the direct debit was confirmed as declined to PayPal on 9 March 
2020.
 
In circumstances such as this, where the dispute centres around the non-payment of a 
direct debit and the subsequent reporting to a credit file because of that non-payment, 
what this service would expect would be that the business reporting the adverse 
information would be able to demonstrate both that they attempted to take the direct 
debit payment, and also that they then informed the customer in a timely manner that 
the payment had failed, thus giving the customer the opportunity to quickly rectify the 
situation before adverse information is reported to their credit file.
 
PayPal appear to have done that here. Theyve provided this service with confirmation 
of the attempt at taking the scheduled March direct debit payment as well as the 
payments rejection on 9 March 2020. PayPal have also provided a copy of email 
correspondence sent to Mr M on 10 March 2020 advising him of the missed payment 
and the need to take corrective action.
 
So, its difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly or unreasonably in regard 
to their actions described above. And while I accept that Mr M had the money in his 
bank account to honour the direct debit, ultimately the direct debit wasnt honoured. 
While it appears that it wasnt Mr Ms fault that the payment wasnt made, it appears 
not to have been PayPals fault either, and therefore I dont feel its fair to censure 
them for the failure of the payment process, given that the failure wasnt because of 
any error or omission that PayPal themselves had made.
 
Additionally, given that PayPal sent Mr M an email the day after the payment was 
declined informing Mr M as such and asking him to take corrective action  and given 
that Mr M didnt take corrective action until the receipt of a later sent email  its also 
difficult to conclude anything other than that the reporting of a late payment by PayPal 
is reasonable here.
 
If it had been the case that PayPal hadnt sent Mr M a notification of the missed 
payment, such that Mr M might not have been reasonably aware that the payment was 
missed, then I might view matters differently. But thats not the case here. And given 
that PayPal did send notification to Mr M in a timely manner that his payment had been 
missed and that corrective action was required by Mr M, Im satisfied that Mr M ought 
reasonably to have been aware that the payment was missed. Because of this I feel 
that its fair for PayPal to report the subsequent late payment of the March 2020 
payment as a late payment. And I say this because, ultimately, thats what happened.
 
However, while I wont be provisionally upholding this aspect of Mr Ms complaint or 
asking PayPal to remove the late payment marker from Mr Ms credit file, it is the case 
that PayPal provided Mr M with incorrect information when he initially contacted PayPal 
which led Mr M to believe that by making the payment over the phone when he did that 
his credit file wouldnt be affected.
 
This resulted in a degree of upset and inconvenience for Mr M when the true state of 
his credit file became known, and I feel that PayPal should make a payment of £50 to 
Mr M to compensate him for this. As such, I will be provisionally upholding this 
complaint in Mr Ms favour on the basis of the incorrect information provided by PayPal 
and the payment of £50 compensation only.
 
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr M and PayPal the opportunity to provide any 
comments or additional information that they wished me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision.
 
PayPal didnt provide any further comments. However, Mr M expressed his disappointment 
with my provisional decision and provided evidence which he believes confirms that PayPal 
only attempted to take the payment once, and not on multiple occasions as he feels that they 
should have done. Mr M also stated that the communication sent by PayPal informing him that his direct debit hadnt been taken had been an automatically generated message and 
therefore not one to which he gave due consideration.
 
I can appreciate Mr Ms points here, but having considered them, my decision hasnt 
changed here. I say this because, regardless of how many times PayPal attempted to take 
the direct debit payment, PayPal have been able to confirm that the payment was confirmed 
to them as being rejected on 9 March, and that they sent notification of this to Mr M on 10 
March. 
 
And, while it was the case that that notification was an automatically generated message, it 
isnt unusual for businesses to send automatically generated messages in circumstances 
such as this, and that the message was automatically generated doesnt in any way detract 
from the importance of the message or that it was incumbent on Mr M to have read the 
message and to have responded in a timely manner to it  which, ultimately, Mr M didnt do. 
 
So, while I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr M was wanting here, it follows that 
my final decision here will be a confirmation of my provisional decision, as explained above. I 
hope that Mr M can understand, given what Ive explained, why I have made the final 
decision that I have.
  
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment of £50 to Mr M to compensate him for the trouble and upset 
he incurred as a result of being given incorrect information by PayPal.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2021.
