The complaint
Mr H complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited, trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat), were unreasonable when contacting him about a payment in October 2021.
Mr H also complains that he paid more interest than he should have done, or was led to 
believe he would pay, despite paying it off early. 
What happened
Mr H took a loan with MoneyBoat on 29 July 2021 for £800. The repayment schedule is set 
out below. This is printed on the loan agreement.

The total amount payable under the agreement was £1,509.29. Mr H paid the loan off early 
and his repayments are recorded as set out in the statement of account tables, both of which  
I have duplicated here: 
Date Amount
2021-08-31 £251.56
2021-09-30 £51.56
2021-10-30 £989.64
Total Capital: Total Interest: Total Charges: Total Discount: Total Amount:
£800.00 £492.76 £0.00 £0.00 £1,292.76
The agreement indicates that Mr H agreed to pay by way of Continuous Payment Authority 
(CPA) which meant that MoneyBoat had his debit card details and took the scheduled 
amount automatically on the scheduled repayment dates. 
After Mr H had complained to MoneyBoat, it replied in its final response letter (FRL) dated 
30 November 2021. It had researched whether reasonable hours for telephone calls to 
customers was stipulated and it concluded that it was not. MoneyBoat cited the well-known 
debt advice charity website guidance which had indicated that most people would agree 
that reasonable hours likely would not include calls before 8am and after 9pm. And if a 
person was a shift worker then different hours would suit better and in those circumstances a 
special note could be made on a lenders file to be aware of this. The call about which Mr H 
complains was made around 8:30 am on 29 October 2021. 
Mr H has not told us, or MoneyBoat, that he had any working hours which were unusual, for 
instance, that he might work during the night. Or that Mr H needed hours when he was not 
disturbed. 
In the FRL, MoneyBoat explained that the interest he had paid was correct and gave some 
further figures to explain why. These were set out in the FRL and both parties have that and 
I do not duplicate them here. 
One of our adjudicators considered the two parts of Mr Hs complaint. He thought that 
MoneyBoat had not done anything wrong by calling him when it did. And he did not think that 
Mr H had been charged incorrectly using the information he (our adjudicator) had at the time.
Mr H disagreed and so our adjudicator obtained the MoneyBoat call recordings. Two were 
sent to us  one being the call from Mr H to MoneyBoat on 29 September 2021, and the 
other being the call from MoneyBoat to Mr H on the morning of 29 October 2021. 
Our adjudicators second view on the interest payment said: The representative from 
Moneyboat gave you an estimated early repayment balance based on you repaying the 
balance in full on 15 October 2021. This offer was £912.65. However, you didn't repay the 
balance until 30 October 2021.
So, our adjudicators view was that there had been a 15 day gap between receiving the 
settlement figure and paying the debt. So, the interest charged had increased in line with the 
agreement. Our adjudicator did not think MoneyBoat had done anything wrong in relation to 
the calls or the interest. Mr H disagreed. The unresolved complaint was passed to me to 
decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have listened to the recorded calls sent to us by MoneyBoat and I have listened to each of 
the recorded calls between Mr H and our adjudicator. 
Dealing with the last call first - the call to Mr H on 29 October 2021 - Mr H has explained to 
our adjudicator that he only took that call because it was appearing on his telephone screen 
as a withheld number and he was already concerned about a family member who was 
unwell and thought the call was about that person. So, I think that the MoneyBoat call took 
Mr H by surprise. He expected it to be the hospital or a doctor and it was MoneyBoat. I can 
hear that note of worry and concern, and some irritation, in his voice which I think was 
understandable in the circumstances. 
Having said that I do not think that MoneyBoat did anything wrong  I think that the call came 
into Mr H at the wrong time for him. Thats unfortunate and nothing I can attribute as being a 
wrong act or a mistake by MoneyBoat. On that call the MoneyBoat representative hardly 
said anything at all and the call was ended by Mr H. So, I do not agree that the MoneyBoat 
representative said anything untoward or that her tone was not as I would expect it to be. Mr H has made much of the reasonableness of the hour. I think it was a reasonable time. 
Theres no stipulation as to set timings. Our adjudicator referred to the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) CONC provision which is clear in its use of language although it does not 
stipulate hours. 
Mr H has not said to us or to MoneyBoat that his working hours were unusual or that he 
ought not to have been disturbed between certain hours. The call recording Ive received 
was recorded in the loan account notes that the call was at 8:35 in the morning on 
29 October 2021. I dont consider that to be outside the concept of reasonable hours as 
outlined by the FCA in the CONC guidance our adjudicator outlined to Mr H in his view. 
Mr H has mentioned to our adjudicator that he feels that he ought to have been given some 
time to fix the problem before getting harrassed by a telephone call on the morning of the 
29 October 2021. Having listened to that very short call, there was no element of 
harrassment that I heard. 
I do see from loan account notes that Mr H received three further calls that day in the 
afternoon and the calls were disconnected. But those notes do not alter my view.
And I think that Mr Hs point that it would have been better to have had time to get the 
payment sorted out before receiving chase-up calls, is not an unreasonable one on his part.  
But the way forward on payment could have been established on that call MoneyBoat made 
to him. Theres no evidence to suggest that the MoneyBoat representative would have done 
anything other than check what had happened. It may be that the call could have sorted 
these points out. So, I think Mr Hs presumption that the call was going to be unpleasant is 
not the reality having listened to it. 
I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint about the 29 October 2021 call. 
As to that part of Mr Hs complaint about the interest, then I have come to these conclusions:
Mr H called MoneyBoat for help on 29 September 2021 and it was given to him. Mr H 
explained hed not received the usual level of wages due to being unwell. He asked 
for the lowest possible repayment figure. Usually its a 50% rate but that was reduced 
further to £51.56.
instead of the CPA taking £251.56, it was agreed that the CPA payment on the next 
day  30 September 2021  would be £51.56. And the CPA took £51.56 by 
arrangement.
Mr H was given the option to go back to normal repayments for the 29 October 2021 
pay date or pay it all off at the end of the month. Mr H explained he was receiving 
some inheritance money and so hed like to pay it all off. 
an indication of the figure for the full repayment was given to Mr H for the end of the 
month scheduled repayment date - 29 October 2021.
Mr H asked about whether hed save money paying it earlier. The MoneyBoat 
representative calculated that if, say, he repaid it all on 15 October 2021 instead of 
29 October 2021 then hed make a saving of £71.85. Mr H had suggested that 
15 October 2021 date as he had expected to receive the inheritance money within 
ten working days. 
Mr H seems to be saying now that was a settlement figure and the amount he paid 
was too much. I disagree. This lower figure in the 29 September 2021 call was an indication on a possible repay date of 15 October 2021 and was to demonstrate to 
Mr H that the sooner he paid it off the cheaper the loan would be for him.
the total loan figure Mr H paid in the end was less than the agreed figure when Mr H 
took the loan - £1,509.29. Mr H paid £1,292.76. The saving was reflected by the early 
full repayment. 
Theres a final point in relation to that 29 September 2021 call, raised by Mr H which was not 
articulated at the start of the complaint process. He mentioned it in the first call he had with 
our adjudicator. I have chosen to deal with it here for completeness. 
The suggestion by Mr H was that there was some sort of refusal to assist him by MoneyBoat 
on 29 September 2021. This was not captured on the recorded call I have listened to and so 
I consider that it was not the case. The MoneyBoat representative was helpful and offered 
him a solution which Mr H accepted. The tone of the call was good natured and helpful.
I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2022.
