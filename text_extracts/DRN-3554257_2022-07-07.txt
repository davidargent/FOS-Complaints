The complaint
A partnership which Ill refer to as B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal) has treated it unfairly by asking for documents it cannot provide and refusing 
to release its funds.
 
The complaint is brought on Bs behalf by one of its partners, Miss R.
What happened
B opened an account with PayPal in May 2019. In November 2021, PayPal reviewed Bs 
account and decided it needed more information about Bs business structure. It requested 
documents from B and at the same time, applied a limitation to Bs account which meant the 
business couldnt withdraw funds from the account until PayPal received the information it 
had requested.  
Over the next four months, B said it provided the documents PayPal had requested to 
evidence its business structure - but they were rejected. B said it had contacted PayPal 
repeatedly to see what was wrong but hadnt received a satisfactory explanation. In March 
2022, PayPal sent B a further email asking it to provide specific documents but the business 
said it has already provided the information requested and is unable to provide the other 
documents on the list which was a business registration number, as the partnership isnt 
registered on Companies House  nor is it required to do so. So B complained to PayPal. 
PayPal didnt uphold the complaint. It responded to say that it believed it had resolved Bs 
complaint  but PayPal didnt provide a resolution or release the funds it was holding in Bs 
account. B wasnt satisfied with PayPals response and asked this service to look into its 
complaint.
Our investigator recommended the complaint be upheld. She thought it was reasonable for 
PayPal to carry out its regulatory checks, but it hadnt done them fairly. She said shed seen 
evidence that B had repeatedly provided the documents PayPal had said were satisfactory, 
but it still hadnt released Bs money and said the documents were illegible  but she didnt 
agree. So she thought PayPal should remove the restriction on Bs account and pay the 
business £150 for the inconvenience caused.
B accepted the investigators view but PayPal didnt respond to say whether it accepted or 
rejected the view. As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me to 
decide. 
Since the case has been referred to an ombudsman for a decision, PayPal has released Bs 
money which was held in its account. So the decision will focus on whether or not PayPals 
actions were reasonable, and any inconvenience caused to B.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it. Ill explain why.
PayPal told us that it restricted Bs account initially in line with its User Agreement. It has 
explained that an account can be limited for a number of reasons which includes the 
business being satisfied that it is complying with relevant law when providing accounts to its 
customers. I think this is reasonable. 
However, the User Agreement also says account limitations are normally removed after 
PayPal has been provided with the information it requested  unless a risk still exists after 
the information has been provided. Based on the evidence Ive seen Im not persuaded 
PayPal acted in line with its User Agreement - and I dont think it treated B fairly. 
I say this because, although PayPal restricted Bs account in November, I cant see that it 
contacted B to explain what was required. And it didnt say to B what needed to be provided 
until mid-December, once B had already uploaded the documents it believed were suitable 
and contacted PayPal to question why its account was still limited.
Ive seen that over the next couple of months, B contacted PayPal to ask what it needed to 
provide, it then uploaded those documents including a letter from HMRC and a letter of 
authorisation, only for PayPal to say that they werent now suitable. Despite being asked 
why, PayPal hasnt confirmed to B or this service why the documents it requested were then 
no longer acceptable.
PayPal also repeatedly asked B to provide proof from Companies House of the partnership, 
but B explained that it wasnt able to provide this as it couldnt register with Companies 
House as it was an ordinary partnership. However, PayPal didnt acknowledge this or 
provide any alternatives despite B saying it had given all the information PayPal had asked 
for and it had nothing else to provide. 
Im pleased to hear from B that PayPal has now released the money it was holding under the 
limitation. However, its taken over eighteen months for PayPal to do this and based on the 
evidence Ive seen I dont think this was reasonable. Its clear that PayPal has caused B 
inconvenience from the repeated calls and emails its had to make. So I think PayPal should 
pay B £150 compensation for the inconvenience caused.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay B £150 compensation for the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2022.
