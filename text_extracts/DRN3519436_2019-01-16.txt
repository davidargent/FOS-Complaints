Miss B says that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid,  lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on this complaint  on 11 December 2018.  A copy 
of it is attached and it forms part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint is 
set out in it, so I wont reiterate that here.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold the complaint in part and asked QuickQuid and 
Miss B to let me know if they had anything to add. Miss B agreed with my provisional 
decision. QuickQuid  made some  additional comments. It said (in summary):
it agreed with my proposed resolution for the last loan
it asked that I take into consideration the substantial breaking periods in between  
the loans, as well as the fluctuating  loan amounts, as these show  Miss B wasnt  
demonstrating a pattern  of spiralling debt
my findings
Ive considered again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Having considered the additional points raised  by QuickQuid, Im not changing the outcome 
I reached in my provisional  decision. Ill explain why.
Id like to confirm I did take into account  the gaps between the loans when considering  
whether QuickQuid had lent responsibly.  I noted that the first loan was taken a considerable 
time before the rest of the loans  and that there was also a reasonably  large gap between 
loans 2 and 3. I also thought the gap between  loans 3 and 4 was less significant on its own, 
but taken together with the size of the loans and other factors  didnt suggest Miss B was 
demonstrating any signs of financial difficulty. As a result, I didnt propose to uphold the 
complaint about  these  loans.
I went on to explain why I thought the situation  changed after loan 4a. If QuickQuid is 
implying that Miss Bs borrowing wasnt ever noticeably frequent,  I dont think it is correct. 
Loan 4 was topped  up after just two days. There was just a 19 day gap until loan 5, which 
was topped up three times with gaps  of three, then nine, then four days between  top-ups. 
The gap between  loan 5 and 6 was five days and a top-up to loan 6 was approved after four 
days. So I thought the requests  for credit  were frequent enough that it was a factor which  
ought to have led QuickQuid to consider it was proportionate to look more closely at Miss Bs 
financial situation.
And looking at the amounts borrowed too, loans 2 and 3 were  for £200 and £250  both 
relatively modest sums.  But QuickQuid went on to lend much  more than this across  loans  4, 
5 and 7. I said in my provisional decision, in relation  to loan 4a:
 bearing in mind  the size of the loan; what QuickQuid knew about Miss Bs income and 
expenditure; the length of the lending relationship (about nine months)  and the pattern of 
borrowing, I think QuickQuids checks were not proportionate. Theres  nothing in the 
Ref: DRN35194362information QuickQuid  has provided to suggest  it reacted to Miss Bs changing situation. 
Simply put, it carried  out the same  checks for a £1,150 loan with a £1,674  repayment as it 
did for a much earlier, smaller £200  loan with a £250  repayment.  I cant  see how, in Miss Bs 
circumstances, this was proportionate.
Although I accept the amounts borrowed fluctuated to some  extent (loan 6 in particular), 
I still believe this was a reasonable conclusion. 
QuickQuid hasnt commented on my findings  about what  I thought proportionate checks  from 
this point onwards  wouldve shown, so Ive no reason to depart from the findings I made on 
this aspect of the complaint.
The points QuickQuid  made arent directly relevant to loans  7 and 8. I upheld the complaint 
about these loans for a different reason and not just because I thought QuickQuid hadnt 
carried out proportionate affordability  checks.  In any event, QuickQuid appears to have  
accepted the outcome I proposed on these loans.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part, for the reasons  given  above and in my provisional decision.
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  put things right by taking  the steps set out in my provisional  
decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February  2019.

background
QuickQuid approved 8 loans for Miss B. Ive included  some of the information  QuickQuid provided 
about the loans in the table below. Some of these were topped up  meaning Miss B borrowed more 
during the course  of the loan agreement. The top ups are denoted below with a letter after the loan 
number. Including  top-ups, there were 18 lending decisions. The declared  income and expenditure 
columns are the figures Miss B included on her loan application. The total expenditure  figure is the 
sum of regular outgoings including housing costs, utility expenses,  transport, food and monthly other 
credit commitments.  This table is included  to provide  information  only and to give a simple  overview 
of the lending history.

my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
When QuickQuid approved loan 1, its regulator was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT had 
published guidance on irresponsible lending  (ILG), including an updated version in February  2011.  
The ILG makes it clear  lenders have  a duty to lend responsibly  this includes undertaking  
proportionate affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans sustainably.  The definition of 
a sustainable repayment includes that payments  should be made  from income and/or savings, without 
undue difficulty and while meeting other reasonable  commitments. There  was no prescriptive list of 
the sort of checks a lender should carry out, but the guidance says lenders may wish to take into 
account factors such as the type of credit,  a customers credit history and their existing financial  
commitments.
The Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA)  was the regulator when QuickQuid approved loans 2 onwards. 
Its Consumer  Credit sourcebook (CONC)  sets out some  of the rules  and guidance for consumer credit  
providers such as QuickQuid. Some of these changed on 1 November 2018 and so the CONC rules 
Ref: DRN35194364and guidance I refer to here were those in place at the time QuickQuid lent to Miss B. CONC 5.3.1G  
(2) said lenders  were  required to take reasonable steps to assess the customers ability  to meet  
repayments under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable manner  without the customer  
incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequences.  
Sustainable was defined (at CONC  5.3.1G  (6)) as the consumer being able to make repayments 
without undue  difficulty.  This meant Miss B ought to have been able to make any loan repayments on 
time, while meeting her other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow further to make 
the repayments.
In short, QuickQuid needed  to assess Miss Bs ability to repay the credit in a sustainable  way. CONC 
(e.g. CONC  5.2.3-4G) gave some guidance about appropriate considerations  these include the 
type, amount and cost of the credit, as well as the financial position of the consumer. Its important to 
note that these are examples of appropriate  factors  to take into account, not explicit  or prescriptive  
rules.
Nonetheless what the rules  and guidance  do make clear is that QuickQuid needed  to be satisfied 
Miss B could afford  to repay the loans in a sustainable way. This means QuickQuid wasnt simply  
assessing the risk to it of lending  (i.e. the risk of the loan not being properly repaid). It also needed to 
take into account  the borrower-focused  risk of the loan not being  sustainable for Miss B.
With this in mind, Ive considered whether  QuickQuid  did enough to check  whether  the loans  were 
affordable. And if I find it didnt, Ill go on to consider whether proportionate checks  wouldve 
suggested the loans  were not affordable.
did QuickQuid carry out proportionate checks?
Bearing in mind  what Ive said above, I think proportionate checks would vary in the circumstances of 
each loan. So Ive looked  at each loan individually. In looking at each loan, I think  its reasonable to 
say a responsible lender would  require more assurance the greater the risk to the consumer of the 
loan being unsustainable. So, for example,  Id expect a lender to seek  more assurance by carrying 
carry out more  detailed checks:
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income; or
-the longer the lending relationship.
loan 1
Loan 1 was approved in 2012  several  years before  the rest of the loans Im considering. From  the 
information QuickQuid has provided, it looks like it carried out credit checks (although it hasnt shown 
us the underlying information for these) and asked Miss B to declare her income. It didnt ask Miss B 
any questions about her expenditure at the time.
The loan was for £200  and repayable in two payments: £30 in May 2012 and then £230 in June. 
QuickQuid didnt have any experience of Miss B as a customer at this time and so it appears to have 
lent a relatively modest amount. Although the creditworthiness checks appear to have been  limited, I 
think they were  proportionate  bearing  in mind the loan amount and Miss Bs income.  I havent seen 
that QuickQuid  was aware of any adverse information which ought to have caused it to carry out 
further checks. Im not planning to uphold  the complaint  about this loan.
loans 2-6
I am going to deal with loans 2-6 (and top-ups) in this section of my decision and deal with loans 7 
and 8 (and top-ups)  separately, for reasons  which  will become  clear later in my decision.
Ref: DRN35194365Along with its earlier submissions, QuickQuid provided  a document  setting out, in general terms,  how 
its affordability assessments  worked at the time it approved these  loans. It has said that (as of 1 
March 2015), all loan offers now meet the FCA rate cap and affordability rules. 
In response to our adjudicator, it said: In response to FOS assessment which  recommends 
QuickQuid uphold  loans  which were funded after March 2015, we regret  to inform you that we cannot  
agree to FOS recommendations .  
In short QuickQuid seems to be saying that because it reviewed its processes and incorporated  
regulatory changes as it was required to, all loans for all customers granted  from 1 March 2015 
onwards were granted responsibly and its checks were always proportionate.
I dont agree with this argument. It doesnt follow  that a firm cannot have  treated any consumer  
unfairly simply because it has been authorised and is regulated by the FCA. The FCA isnt 
prescriptive about what checks a lender  should carry out. As Ive summarised above,  it gives 
examples in CONC about what might be appropriate. But a lender should still bear in mind  both the 
consumers circumstances and the particulars  of the loan in question. It doesnt follow  that being  
authorised means  doing the same checks, each and every time, is proportionate  whatever the 
circumstances of the potential borrower and the particulars of the loan. In effect, QuickQuid is asking 
me to pre-judge the complaint on the basis of its current lending model.  And Im not prepared to do 
that.
This is not least because there are also other considerations which  I am required  to take into account  
when making determinations on complaints.
DISP 3.6.1R says The Ombudsman will determine a complaint by reference to what is, in his opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of the case.
So, I am required to consider more  than the relevant  rules and guidance.  I must take these  into 
account. But I will do so in considering the broader question  of whether  QuickQuid treated Miss B 
fairly and reasonably.
With this in mind, Ive considered each loan individually and set out my current  findings  about  the 
proportionality of the checks below.
loan 2
This was a £200 loan, drawn down  on 16 December 2016. The contractual  repayments were £67.20 
on 27 January 2017, £49.60 on 27 Feb and £244.80 due on 27 March.  Miss B reported net monthly 
income of £2,400 and total monthly expenditure of £2,000. This left approximately £400 in disposable 
income.
QuickQuid carried out credit  checks but I havent seen the results  of these. Despite this, 
I think  QuickQuids checks were proportionate in the circumstances. The largest  payment  was around 
£245 and was to be made in the third month following  two much smaller  payments. I think QuickQuid 
acted reasonably when it decided this loan was affordable.  Im not planning to uphold the complaint 
about this loan.
loan 3
My findings  are much  the same as for loan 2. This was only the second loan in this chain of 
borrowing. Miss Bs reported income  was the same as for the previous loan. I note she reported much 
lower monthly expenditure  of £1,425  - her declared expenditure on food, monthly credit commitments 
and other  expenses reduced significantly.
Ref: DRN35194366Without having seen the results of QuickQuids  credit  checks, its difficult to assess  how reasonable it 
was for it to accept Miss Bs significantly lower expenditure. But I dont think loan 3 wouldve looked  
unaffordable even if Miss B hadnt changed her reported expenditure. So again, I think QuickQuid 
acted reasonably when it decided this loan was affordable.  Im not planning to uphold the complaint 
about this loan.
loans 4-4a
There was a gap of 43 days between the repayment of loan 3 and loan 4 being  drawn down. I dont 
think this was a particularly significant  gap, bearing in mind the short-term  purpose of this sort of 
lending. But the amount  Miss B wanted  to borrow was small and the repayment appeared to be 
affordable, bearing  in mind Miss Bs reported income and expenditure. I dont think QuickQuid needed  
to be concerned about  how much or how often Miss B was borrowing  at this stage. So Im not 
planning on upholding  the complaint about loan 4.
But I think the situation changed when Miss B applied  for the top-up  Ive labelled 4a. The top-up was 
for £1,150,  not far short  of six times the original  sum borrowed  and was approved  just two days  after 
loan 4. It meant Miss Bs largest  repayment  increased to £1,674  far greater than a single month of 
her declared  disposable income of about £975.
As a result, the loan was structured as follows:
A payment  of £240.80 was due on 27 October,  then £334.80 on 27 November and finally £1,674 due 
on 27 December  a total of £2,230 during a period in which Miss Bs disposable  income was 
reportedly about £2,925  (£975 x3). This was nearly 80% of Miss Bs declared disposable income.
This also meant Miss B would have to save  income  from month to month to put towards  the last, 
largest payment.  This aspect of the lending decision  in particular causes me some concern.  That Miss 
B needed to borrow £1,150, presumably unexpectedly, just two days after (again, I assume  
unexpectedly) borrowing £200 doesnt to me suggest much of a capacity to save. After all, if Miss B 
was saving  from month-to-month, then why had she borrowed £200-£250 on three previous,  relatively 
recent, occasions, when her monthly  disposable  income  was apparently £975?
So at this point, bearing in mind the size of the loan; what QuickQuid knew about Miss Bs income 
and expenditure; the length of the lending relationship  (about  nine months) and the pattern of 
borrowing, I think  QuickQuids checks were not proportionate. Theres nothing  in the information  
QuickQuid has provided to suggest it reacted  to Miss Bs changing situation.  Simply put, it carried  out 
the same checks for a £1,150 loan with a £1,674 repayment as it did for a much earlier,  smaller £200  
loan with a £250 repayment.  I cant see how, in Miss Bs circumstances,  this was proportionate.
what would proportionate checks likely have shown?
loan 4a and onwards
I now need  to consider what  would have  been  proportionate. And I think  the amount Miss B wanted  to 
borrow was so large, relative to her declared  disposable  income that QuickQuid ought  to have asked 
her for some evidence  of her income and expenditure before deciding if it would approve the loan.
It didnt do this and so I cant  be certain about what it wouldve  seen.  But Miss B has provided  us with 
her bank statements.  And in the absence of anything else,  I think  its reasonable to rely on them.  I 
think they will provide a reasonable and factual account of Miss Bs income and outgoings at the time.  
Ive paid particular  attention to the statements in the three months before loan 4a (July-September  
2017).
Ref: DRN35194367The bank statements  reveal that Miss B was spending very large  sums of money on gambling. In July 
2017 Miss B was paid around £3,000. But there are over 100 gambling transactions on the bank 
statement, totalling more than £3,500. Miss B also pays over £1,800 to various short-term  lenders and 
borrows or re-borrows from many of them in the same month. Theres also a large monthly payment 
of over £400 to a debt charity.
Its clear that Miss Bs finances were quite unstable  and that she was spending relatively large sums 
of money on gambling.  I think  it is likely  QuickQuid wouldve established this with proportionate 
checks. I think it also would likely have seen a more  comprehensive  picture of how Miss B was relying 
on short-term finance and that alone would  probably  have been enough to put a responsible lender off 
providing further loans. Particularly the type of loans QuickQuid provided, which (with perhaps one or 
two exceptions) required  Miss B to save from month-to-month. I cant see how QuickQuid could 
reasonably have expected her to do this given her level of indebtedness.
The situation  doesnt change for the rest of the period of lending. So I think  the lending  from loan 4a 
(approved on 5 October  2017) and onwards  was irresponsible. Im planning therefore  to uphold the 
complaint about the lending on and after this date. However, Ill deal with loans 7 and 8 separately 
below, for reasons which will become clear.
did QuickQuid act unfairly  in some other way?
I think  QuickQuid did act unfairly when  it approved loan 7, 8 and the associated top-ups.
QuickQuid received a complaint from Miss B about irresponsible  lending on 26 March 2018. It 
acknowledged receipt of this complaint on 28 March and sent its final response to Miss B on 23 April. 
In Miss Bs complaint letter she made the following statement (Ive added the bold emphasis): I am in 
a DMP [debt management plan] and was in a DMP before I took out the payday loans, I took one out 
and it spiralled out of control. I was and still am in financial  difficulty.
So as of 26 March QuickQuid was aware Miss B had said she a) was in financial  difficulty and b) was 
in a debt management plan. She was also of the opinion that her debts  had spiralled  out of control. 
Despite this QuickQuid advanced seven further loans or top-ups. QuickQuid  lent Miss B a total of 
£1,400 in May 2018 and £475 in June 2018.
Given that QuickQuid  was aware Miss B had made the above statement, Id expect  to see  in the 
event it thought  it was responsible to consider lending  that it carried out rigorous affordability checks 
before lending her further sums. Her statement suggests Miss B had only limited, if any, disposable 
income. But theres no evidence QuickQuid carried out any affordability checks beyond its usual 
process. So I think its clear  it didnt  take account of what Miss B had said and in such  circumstances 
its lending was irresponsible.
This services approach to redress for irresponsible lending would  usually  involve asking a lender to 
write off interest and charges. But in some circumstances,  we might tell a lender to write off all the 
debt. Examples  of where we might do this are available  on the technical  resource section  of our 
website.1 The examples include where a lender actually knew a person was struggling  financially 
when it approved a loan.
As Ive set out above, I think its clear QuickQuid knew Miss B was struggling financially  when it 
approved loans 7, 8 and their associated top-ups. So I think it acted unfairly by approving  them  
without doing enough to check whether Miss Bs circumstances would allow for her to repay  the loans 
sustainably.
1 https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/payday-lending-case-
studies.html#a
Ref: DRN35194368I think  Miss B has to accept  some responsibility  too. She also knew  she was in difficulty  and yet 
continued to apply for further  loans. Ive taken this into account  when thinking  about  what  QuickQuid 
should do to put things right in relation  to loans  7-8.
As QuickQuid  approved these loans knowing Miss B had said was in financial difficulty, in a debt 
management plan and not able to control her debts, I intend to tell it to write off all the debt (capital,  
interest and charges) for loan 8, which I understand still has an outstanding balance. I plan to tell 
QuickQuid to refund the interest and charges on loan 7, in line with our usual approach.
But I also plan to say QuickQuid can apply  any refund of interest and charges on loans 4a-7c  to 
reduce the outstanding  capital debt on loan 8. This may or may not leave an amount of capital  for 
QuickQuid to write off.  I think this strikes a fair balance,  bearing  in mind both Miss B and QuickQuid 
have some responsibility for the lending  continuing after March 2018.
what QuickQuid needs  to do to put things  right
I plan to tell QuickQuid  to:
refund the interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 4a-7c (inclusive)
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when Miss B paid them  until the date of 
settlement
remove any outstanding interest and charges from loans 8-8b and treat any payments made 
as payments towards the capital
remove any adverse  information about loans 4a-8b from Miss Bs credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Miss B a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Once it has done  the above, QuickQuid may use the net refund for loans 4a-7c to reduce  the 
outstanding capital balance on loans 8-8b. If this still leaves an unpaid  balance on loans 8-8b, 
QuickQuid must write off this debt.  If the refund is greater than the outstanding  capital balance  on 
loans 8-8b,  QuickQuid must pass the difference to Miss B.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold the complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
