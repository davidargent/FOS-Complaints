Complaint
 
Mr H complained about 16 loans he took out through a company called Gain Credit LLC, 
trading as Lending Stream (LS). Mr H says he was lent to irresponsibly and the 
loans caused him financial problems.
Background
I issued a provisional decision (PD) about this complaint in May 2020. This final decision 
should be read in conjunction with that.
In the PD I set out, in some considerable detail, why I thought the complaint should be 
upheld from the point of loan number 6 onwards. This was rather earlier in the lending chain 
than our adjudicator had originally suggested. Ive attached an appendix again at the bottom 
of this decision summarising the lending.
Given the potential change in outcome, I asked both parties to note the PDs contents 
carefully and provide any further submissions or information they wanted me to consider, 
within 4 weeks. 
My findings
Ive now reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve only had a response from Mr H 
and he accepted what Id recommended in my PD. LS didnt respond. So Im taking the view 
that neither party has, or wants, to disagree with what I recommended in my PD. 
In that case, theres no reason for me to change the findings I set out previously. 
In my PD I comprehensively explained that LS shouldnt have lent to Mr H from the point of 
loan number 6 onwards. By this point in time, Mr H was a regular customer of LS and it 
would have had a lot of lending history with which to assess his overall financial situation. As 
I have pointed out, by loan 6 Mr Hs financial vulnerability should have been clearly evident 
to LS but it failed to take account of this when deciding to lend him money in my view. So my 
final decision is that from loan number 6 onwards LS lent irresponsibly.
As also explained, I think from the point of loan 8 onwards there were additional reasons to 
uphold the complaint. By this point Mr H wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term 
cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very regularly, to address shortfalls in his income and 
to meet an ongoing need. Mr H was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term 
lending over a sustained period. LS repeatedly lent to Mr H in an unsustainable manner 
because these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period.  The 
length of time over which Mr H borrowed was also likely to have had negative implications 
on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans. 
Putting things right  what LS needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 - 16;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 11-16* and treat any 
payments Mr H made towards these loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Hs loans 11 - 16 accounts as Ive directed results in him effectively 
having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then LS should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement.
if reworking Mr Hs loans 11 - 16 accounts leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then LS can use the total refund for other loans to offset this. And if there is still an 
outstanding capital balance then I would remind it that it should take a sympathetic 
view when seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr H for 
the remaining capital
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loans 6 
and 7;
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 - 16 should be completely 
removed from Mr Hs credit file;
if certain loans have been sold LS should buy them back or otherwise ensure the 
above is complied with.
*I understand loans 11-16 were never fully repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires LS to take off tax from this interest. LS must give Mr H a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr Hs complaint and I direct Gain Credit LLC to pay the compensation as 
outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
