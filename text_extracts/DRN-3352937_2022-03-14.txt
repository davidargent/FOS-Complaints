The complaint
Mrs M is unhappy with the way PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has handled a refund she 
received, and her subsequent enquiries.
Whats happened?
Mrs M made a card payment for £287 to a merchant via PayPal on 19 December 2016.
The merchant issued a refund for £252 on 17 January 2017 - £196.20 was refunded to 
Mrs Ms card and £55.80 was refunded to her PayPal balance.
Mrs M questioned why the whole £252 was not refunded back to her card, as this was the 
original payment method. She also wanted to know:
whether shed spent the £55.80 refunded to her PayPal balance.
if any other refunds shed received had been refunded to her PayPal balance, rather 
than the original payment method.
what her current PayPal balance was, and what it had been over time.
Mrs M says PayPals responses to her queries were confusing and didnt really provide the 
information she was looking for. So, she referred a complaint to our Service. 
What has PayPal said since the complaint was referred to us?
A payment which Mrs M made on 11 January 2017 via PayPal was not charged from her 
card due to a technical issue. Instead, the funds were deducted from her PayPal balance, 
which was zero at the time  leaving her with a negative balance for £55.80. When the 
merchant refunded £252 to Mrs M on 17 January 2017, the first £55.80 was used to bring 
her PayPal balance back to zero, and the remainder was refunded back to her original 
payment card.
PayPal apologised for any confusion its technical error had caused.
It also provided a spreadsheet containing Mrs Ms transaction history from January 2017 for 
her perusal and confirmed her current PayPal balance.
What did our investigator say?
Our investigator found that PayPal did not satisfactorily explain to Mrs M why her £252 
refund was split between her card and PayPal balance before she referred her complaint to 
our Service, as it can reasonably be expected to have done. And it didnt provide the 
detailed record of transactions she was entitled to or confirm her PayPal balance in good 
time. She recommended that PayPal pay Mrs M £75 in recognition of the trouble and upset 
these errors caused her.
PayPal accepted our investigators recommendation and credited Mrs Ms account with £75. 
It said Mrs M could withdraw this money to her bank account in the usual way, if she wished 
to do so. 
Mrs M said:
she has checked her statements and the payment of £55.80 was not made from her 
card on 11 January 2017, as PayPal has said.
she wants to know what caused the technical error PayPal has referred to and she 
thinks its unacceptable if it cant provide an explanation.
a refund of £15.30 appears to have gone back to her PayPal balance too.
she doesnt think the transaction history PayPal has provided her with is very clear  
she wants something thats better formatted and more basic, containing the specific 
information she requires. 
she would like confirmation that no other transactions have been refunded 
incorrectly.
PayPal was not able to answer Mrs Ms queries to her satisfaction, and the complaint has 
now been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is my role to decide whether a business error has occurred and, if it has, what the business 
should to put things right.
PayPal has explained that a technical error on 11 January 2017 created a negative PayPal 
balance for Mrs M, and this is the reason why her refund on 17 January 2017 was split 
between her card and her PayPal balance. Ive seen evidence which supports what its said, 
and Mrs M has confirmed that £55.80 was not paid from her card. Its unclear why this 
technical error occurred but I dont believe I need to consider this in the circumstances. As 
its common ground that an error did indeed occur, I need to decide what PayPal should do 
to put things right. 
Mrs M was understandably unsure why some of her £252 refund went to her PayPal 
balance. PayPal has now, through our Services intervention, explained why the refund was 
split and given Mrs M detailed information about her account  including a transaction history 
and current balance. But, from what Ive seen, Im persuaded that PayPal ought reasonably 
to have taken this action sooner than it did.
PayPal has paid Mrs M £75 in this respect, and Im satisfied that this is a fair and reasonable 
amount of compensation in consideration of the trouble and upset it caused Mrs M.
I appreciate that Mrs M finds the transaction history PayPal has provided unclear. But Im 
satisfied that it has made reasonable efforts to provide her with the information she requires, 
and Im not persuaded that it needs to do more here.In an attempt to clarify matters for Mrs M, I have checked the transaction history in the six 
years prior to Mrs M bringing her case to this Service and I cant see any refunds shes been 
issued with that havent gone back to the relevant payment card, other than a refund for 
£15.30 on 25 January 2017 which was credited to her PayPal balance. This balance went 
towards a payment Mrs M made on 2 March 2017, so she has had the benefit of those 
funds. Even if other refunds had been credited to her PayPal account, she would have had 
the benefit of those funds when making future transactions.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
has done enough to resolve this complaint. I do not instruct it to do anything further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2022.
