K820x#14complaint
Mr B complained because  National Westminster  Bank Plc closed his accounts.  He also 
complained that the bank didnt respond within set timescales to a Subject Access Request 
which he made.
background
Mr B complained to NatWest about  service  from two branches,  saying  hed repeatedly been 
trying to obtain a replacement for his lost debit card. There had also been issues about 
possible fraud on Mr Bs account.  Mr B had disputed some  transactions which NatWest had 
refunded to his account. 
 
On 22 November 2018, NatWest replied to Mr Bs complaint. It told Mr B it had made  a 
commercial decision to close  his account, and this was why it hadnt been able to provide 
him with a debit card.  It paid Mr B £30 for any out of pocket  expenses and inconvenience.
Mr B complained about NatWests decision to close his accounts.  NatWests reply quoted 
section 12.2 of the Terms  and Conditions of Mr Bs account, which set out the circumstances 
in which  the bank could close an account  immediately,  and also set out that it could close  
any account by giving  at least 60 days notice. NatWest told Mr B that it had no legal 
obligation to explain  the reasons for the closure.
There was further  correspondence and on 10 January 2019 Mr B requested a Data  Subject  
Access request  via an online form. This wasnt  processed promptly and when Mr B 
complained, NatWest paid him £100  compensation. But NatWest refused to provide any 
information about the fraudulent transactions on Mr Bs account, because this related to its 
security procedures. It said that if Mr B reported the matter to the police, NatWest would co-
operate fully with the police investigation.
On 15 February 2019, NatWests account  closing team wrote to tell Mr B that his accounts 
would be closed on 5 March. 
Mr B wasnt  satisfied and complained to this service about NatWest closing his account. He 
explained that he felt victimised by NatWest, because hed raised  a complaint when he kept 
not receiving the replacement  debit  card for the one hed lost. Mr B said he didnt want the 
account closure negatively to affect  him in future. And he wanted an apology for the stress 
and anxiety which resulted from NatWests unfounded accusations.
The investigator didnt  uphold Mr Bs complaint. He said that as NatWest had refunded the 
disputed transactions  in full, there  was no need  to make a finding on this. He explained that 
NatWest was entitled to close Mr Bs account at any time. Hed have  expected NatWest to 
have given Mr B 60 days notice of closing the accounts, but as the bank  didnt do that, the 
investigator had looked  at the impact this had on Mr B. There had only been  a few 
transactions each  month, and Mr B had told the investigator he had another  account with a 
different bank. So the investigator wasnt persuaded there had been any significant  impact 
from the lower amount  of notice. And there  was no evidence NatWest had recorded  any 
negative information  about Mr B.
In relation to Mr Bs subject access request, the investigator said that the bank had sent the 
reply on 14 March 2019 to the email address on the account. Mr B had emailed asking  to 
change his email  address  on 27 February 2019, and NatWest had replied on 1 March, 
Ref: DRN07452222saying that for security  reasons  it could only change the email address by phone or in a 
branch. Mr B hadnt  then contacted the bank in either of these two ways. The investigator 
concluded that if there had been  any significant impact on Mr B from not getting the subject  
access request promptly, Mr B would have  chased NatWest. So he didnt uphold  Mr Bs 
complaint.
Mr B wasnt  satisfied. He said the investigator hadnt  taken into account the full impact of not 
being able to access his account  unless he visited a branch. He said he hadnt  been able to 
make any card payments  or any online banking between losing his card and opening an 
account with another  bank. Mr B said that for about  5 months NatWest had kept telling him a 
card would be sent to him, and it wasnt acceptable that NatWest had kept lying to him for 
that time.  He also said it also wasnt acceptable that the investigator hadnt arranged  for 
NatWest to send Mr Bs Subject Access Request.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Closure of Mr Bs accounts
Banks are entitled to close a customers accounts  and end the commercial relationship. 
They dont have  to give customers  a reason. This mirrors the fact that customers can decide 
to close their accounts with a bank without giving a reason.  I have looked at what the terms 
and conditions of Mr Bs NatWest account say. These show  that in Mr Bs circumstances,  
NatWest would give 60 days notice  of closure.
NatWest first wrote to tell Mr B that it was closing his accounts  on 22 November 2018. Mr 
Bs accounts were  closed  on 5 March 2019. In practice, this was more than 60 days.  But this 
was because the bank didnt initially implement the closure. It didnt send a letter setting out 
the 5 March closure date until 18 February. So Mr B knew in November 2018 that his 
accounts were to be closed, but didnt get official notification  of what  the date would be, until 
14 days before, in February.
Ive considered the potential impact on Mr B of the fact that he didnt know the precise  date 
of closure until 14 days before, rather than 60 days.  I find that in practice this made very little 
difference because  Mr B knew around  100 days in advance  that the closures would happen,  
just not the exact date. So he could have started to make other  banking  arrangements  well 
before the actual  closure date  and he told us that he opened an account  elsewhere in 
December. So Mr Bs new account with another bank was up and running by the time he 
received NatWests 18 February  letter giving the exact date of closure. So I dont consider 
there was any substantial impact on Mr B as a result  of NatWest not giving a set date 60 
days in advance of closure. 
Not being issued with a replacement debit card
Mr B said that the investigator didnt understand the impact on him as a result  of not being 
able to access his account from May 2018 onwards, except by visiting  a branch. He said that 
he kept being told hed get a replacement card and that NatWest  kept lying to him for about 
5 months.
Ref: DRN07452223I dont have any documentary evidence to show when Mr B reported his card lost to 
NatWest. Not do I have any documentary evidence of Mr B being told that a new card was 
on its way to him when  it wasnt. The disputed transactions  started in May, so I accept its 
likely that was when  there  started  to be problems. It was several  months before NatWest  
confirmed in November  that it was closing  Mr Bs accounts. During that time, Mr B wouldnt 
have been able to make debit card payments or online banking  transactions.  
I accept that Mr B would  have had a certain amount of inconvenience in not being able to 
use a debit card or make online banking transactions. But investigations into disputed  and 
possibly fraudulent transactions can take time,  and NatWest was entitled to ensure that all 
security measures were conducted  fully. The inconvenience to Mr B is reflected in NatWests  
payment of £30 to Mr B, set out in the 22 November 2018 letter. NatWest said this was for 
any out of pocket expenses and inconvenience. And it said if this does not cover  your full 
costs then please let me know so further  consideration can be given. I have  seen no 
evidence that Mr B ever did respond to that part of NatWests letter with specific details of 
other costs  hed incurred,  which he wanted the bank to reimburse. So I dont award any 
additional payments.
Subject Access  Request
First, its important to say that NatWest was entitled not to send Mr B any documents  which  
related to the disputed transactions or its security processes. 
Looking at what happened, NatWest  didnt respond  within the standard 30 day timescale to 
Mr Bs Subject Access Request  of 10 January 2019. As Ive set out above, NatWest 
apologised for this and paid Mr B £100  for the delay. I consider that this is fair and 
reasonable compensation.
 
NatWest then told Mr B that it would  send all the qualifying documents  to Mr B within 30 
days from 12 February. I have seen evidence to show that NatWest  did send the information 
to Mr B on 14 March, which met the deadline. That was sent to the email address on Mr Bs 
file.
I recognise that Mr B had emailed NatWest to say hed changed email  address. But NatWest  
had replied on 1 March to say that for security reasons, Mr B would have to phone or go into 
a branch to change  his email address. Ive seen no record that Mr B did this. So I dont 
consider NatWest was wrong to do this. I also note that our investigator asked NatWest  to 
send the response  by post as well, which it agreed to do. 
As Mr B didnt comply  with NatWests security requirements for changing  his email address, 
and the documents were sent on 14 March which was in line with the deadline from 12 
February, I find that NatWest doesnt  need to pay Mr B any more compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020
