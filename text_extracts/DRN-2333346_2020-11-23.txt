The complaint
Mrs A complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) closed her account without 
giving any forewarning, and without explaining its reasons. And called in Mrs As overdraft 
without giving her time to pay it off, then applied a default to her credit file when she failed to 
make payment.
To put things right, Mrs A wants NatWest to remove the default marker from her credit file, 
agree a repayment plan for the overdraft debt and waive charges that NatWest applied to 
her overdraft after it closed her account.
What happened
In May 2019, NatWest wrote to Mrs A, telling her it intended to close her account. It gave her 
seven days notice and said she would need to repay her overdraft. Mrs A complained 
saying she needed more time to make alternative banking arrangements and that she 
couldnt repay the overdraft.
NatWest rejected her complaint. It said it had acted in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of her account, and it gave her 28 days notice to repay the overdraft, failing which 
it said it would default the account and apply a marker against Mrs As credit file.
Mrs A didnt repay the overdraft so NatWest defaulted the account and passed the debt to a 
collection agency.
When our investigator looked at Mrs As complaint, she said that NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong, so she didnt uphold Mrs As complaint. Mrs A felt NatWests timescales 
were unreasonable, so she asked for an ombudsman to review the matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure
Just as a customer may close an account with a bank, a bank is entitled to close an account 
with a customer. But when it closes the account, it must do so in a way which complies with 
the terms and conditions of the account.
NatWest write to Mrs A on 24 May 2019, confirming it intended to close her account. It 
referred her to the relevant section of the terms and conditions of her account and said the 
account would be closed in seven days time.
A bank doesnt always have to give reasons for its decision to close an account. Having 
considered the information NatWest has provided me in support of its decision, Im satisfied 
it acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of Mrs As account when it closed the 
account. And that it wasnt obliged to tell Mrs A the reasons for its decision or give any 
additional notice or forewarning.
I understand Mrs As frustration at the situation, and I know she wanted more time to make 
alternative banking arrangements. But, having looked at all of the available evidence, I cant 
say that NatWest did anything wrong. So, Im not upholding this part of Mrs As complaint.
The default
In the letter NatWest sent to Mrs A, confirming its intention to close her account, it explained 
that any overdraft on the account would be taken away and that any debt Mrs A owed 
NatWest would need to be repaid in full. At the date of NatWests letter, Mrs As account was 
overdrawn by £1,292.79.
On 4 June 2019, NatWest wrote to Mrs A to say she had 28 days to repay or make 
satisfactory arrangements to repay her overdraft. It said it would register information with 
credit reference agencies if she did not do so.
Mrs A has explained to our service that she wasnt able to repay the overdraft, due to her 
financial circumstances. Shes told us that she was heavily pregnant at the time this was 
happening, that NatWests actions put her under a great deal of stress. And that NatWest 
didnt give her a fair opportunity to repay the debt.
I have no doubt Mrs A was under pressure at the time NatWest closed her account and 
withdrew her overdraft. And Im sorry to hear of the stress she went through. With that being 
said, I would only uphold her complaint if I thought NatWest had done something it shouldnt 
have, or if I thought it had treated her unfairly.
The terms and conditions of Mrs As account state that the overdraft is repayable on 
demand, and I wouldnt expect NatWest to keep the overdraft in place after it had closed Mrs 
As account. Having looked at the evidence, Im satisfied NatWest gave Mrs A a reasonable 
time to repay her overdraft, and that it acted fairly by inviting her to make arrangements to 
repay the debt, if it could not be repaid in full.
I cant see that Mrs A took any action with regard to repaying the overdraft, or attempting to 
agree a suitable repayment plan. Mrs A did write to NatWest, explaining that 28 days to 
repay the overdraft was not realistic. But I havent seen anything from Mrs A to show she 
made any proposals for repayment, or contacted NatWest to discuss any such proposals. 
And Mrs A didnt make any payments against the debt until she paid £45 on 4 September 
2020, over a year after the overdraft was called in.
So, even if I were to accept that NatWest hadnt given Mrs A a reasonable opportunity to 
make suitable repayment proposals, I still couldnt reasonably say Mrs A would have been 
able to agree a satisfactory repayment plan, given she didnt make any payments against 
the debt for 15 months.
When Mrs A first came to our service, she asked us to ask NatWest if it would freeze 
charges on her account until this issue was resolved. But NatWest declined to do so. 
Regrettably, overdrafts do attract charges and interest in these circumstances. And I dont 
think it would be appropriate for me to tell NatWest to refund charges incurred in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the account, unless there was some other good reason to 
do so. 
Having looked at all of the evidence both parties have provided me, Im sorry to say Ive 
seen no basis on which I might tell NatWest to refund any interest or charges. While this may not be much consolation to Mrs A, all I can say is that NatWest didnt apply any further 
charges after it defaulted Mrs As account. And that it probably would have continued to 
apply interest and charges, had it not defaulted her account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2020.
