K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) unfairly  applied  a default to 
her credit file.  
background
Miss M held a current account  and a loan with NatWest.  In September 2017,  she switched 
her current  account to another bank and moved  house around the same time. There was a 
remaining overdraft balance on Miss Ms current account and she assumed this would be 
transferred to her new bank. The overdraft did not transfer and Miss M agreed to repay  the 
outstanding balance in three instalments.  
Because NatWest  didnt  receive the repayments,  it passed the current account to its debt 
recovery agents, Moorcroft.  It also terminated Miss Ms loan and passed  it to Moorcroft so it 
could collect outstanding balances on both accounts. In April 2018, NatWest  applied a 
default to Miss Ms credit file due to the unpaid overdraft balance.  
When Miss M collected her mail from her previous address, she complained  to NatWest. 
She said that she was unaware the accounts would be passed  to Moorcroft  and a default 
applied to her credit  file. Miss M has also complained that she tried to pay the outstanding 
overdraft balance before  the default  was applied but was told by NatWest  that she couldnt 
because the account was closed. 
NatWest said it sent default letters to the address it had for Miss M because  she did not 
provide her new address. It also said it ended the loan agreement and passed  this to 
Moorcroft because Miss M had defaulted  on another  NatWest  product. 
Our investigator didnt  think NatWest  did anything wrong because it applied  the default  to the 
credit file correctly and that NatWest ended the loan agreement  in line with its terms and 
conditions. Miss M disagreed and has asked me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive not upheld  
Miss Ms complaint and have explained  why below. I understand this is very upsetting time 
for Miss M, but my role is to decide  if NatWest  acted reasonably  when dealing with 
Miss Ms accounts. 
I can see from NatWests system notes that Miss M was aware of the outstanding overdraft 
balance because she agreed to repay this over three payments. However, none of these 
payments were made.  Miss M does not dispute  that she failed to make these payments 
because she told us this was an oversight.  
Miss M said she tried to pay towards  the outstanding  balance  by phone  and in branch before 
the default was applied  to her credit file. I asked NatWest to provide the call recording from 
when Miss M set up the repayment plan and any other call recordings to show  when Miss M 
made contact to pay towards the debt. 
NatWest said the call from when  Miss M set up the repayment plan was unavailable due to 
the passage of time. However, it did provide system notes and call recordings from 
Ref: DRN88864592Moorcroft. NatWest also explained Miss M would be directed to the debt management team 
to make payment  if she was to make contact  through  a branch or its general  phone line. 
I cant say for sure that Miss M didnt go into a branch to discuss  the account as NatWest  
said a branch wouldnt always keep a record of this. However, I find it more  likely than not 
that Miss M would have  been directed to contact  the debt management team had she made 
contact. I cant  see she did this before 23 April 2018,  after the default was applied  and the 
debt was passed to Moorcroft. 
I am also unable to find any evidence to show that Miss M discussed her change of address 
until the call on 23 April 2018. The system notes dont reflect that a conversation took place 
about a change of address and, as above, the call recording is unavailable. Because  of this, 
I cant say that NatWest did anything wrong  by sending the default letters to Miss Ms 
previous address. 
Overall, I am satisfied that the default was applied to Miss Ms credit file due to an 
outstanding balance on her current account that went  unpaid  for some time.  Because of this, 
I think the default on Miss Ms credit file shows an accurate  reflection  of the handling  of the 
account and I dont think NatWest should remove this. 
With regards to Miss Ms loan account being  sent to Moorcroft along with the outstanding 
overdraft balance, the terms of the loan agreement allow NatWest to terminate the loan 
agreement when another NatWest account  defaults.  NatWest has shown that the default 
was applied to the current account  only and not the loan account.  As I am satisfied that the 
defaulted was applied correctly, I think its fair for NatWest to rely on the terms of the loan 
agreement. 
I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong  in applying the default to Miss Ms credit  file, 
ending the loan agreement and sending the accounts to Moorcroft. So, I see no reason to 
ask NatWest to remove the default  and recall the loan account  from Moorcroft.
Miss M also raised  concerns that Moorcroft asked to pay less than her previous monthly  
payments towards  her loan account.  NatWest has told me that Miss M could pay more than 
what Moorcroft offered  as a repayment and I understand that she has maintained  her 
previous monthly  repayments without any issues. I dont consider this has caused an unfair  
outcome for Miss M. 
I understand Miss M was concerned about how long NatWest  took to respond to her 
complaint. On review  of the final response  letter, I can see that it responded within  regulatory  
timescales and I dont think there were any unreasonable delays.  
Ref: DRN88864593my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
