The complaint
Mr P complained about what happened when he tried to get PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA
to get his money back for him, under its buyer protection scheme. 
What happened
Mr P bought a spare part, on 12 August 2019. It was some time before he wanted to fit it. He
said hed looked at the pictures, and spoken to the seller twice, before he bought the item. 
But when he opened the package, he said that it was nothing like what had been described. 
He said a number of parts were missing, which were shown in the picture, and which hed 
been told on the phone were present. He also said that the item didnt fit.
Mr P told us hed spoken to the seller, but the seller wouldnt give him his money back. And
hed spoken to his bank, who told him to ask PayPal to make a refund.
On 22 January, Mr P asked PayPal to get his money back for him, under its buyer protection
scheme.
On 30 January, PayPal told him it couldnt help, because the item has been altered while in
his possession. Mr P said it hadnt.
On 19 February, PayPal told him it couldnt help, because its buyer protection covers goods
or services that werent delivered or werent as described. Mr P said this item was not as
described on the sellers website, or over the phone when he called about it.
On 4 March, PayPal told him it couldnt help, because if the item was materially similar to
the sellers description, PayPal doesnt consider it to be significantly not as described. Mr P
said it wasnt similar.
PayPal said Mr Ps claim had been turned down because of the length of time between the
purchase and him filing his claim. It said it allows buyers to file claims up to 180 days after
the purchase, but that is to allow time for delivery for goods with a long lead time, or to cover
delays in postage.
PayPal said that if someones complaining that an item is significantly not as described, they
have to inspect items on arrival, and report any issues to PayPal in a timely manner. It said
its buyer protection service is a form of arbitration, and it has to try to be as fair as possible
to both parties. It said in this case it could no longer be sure that the item was in the same
condition as when it was received.
PayPal also said its terms make clear its decision is final. It drew a number of its terms to our
attention.
Our investigator said PayPal had told us, for online purchases the purchase needs to be
different from the description before purchase in the relevant online listing. 'Purchase
Description' isnt defined. Our investigator said shed checked similar listings, and the
description generally says what is included and what isn't. This one didnt, so she thought it
was reasonable to rely on the photograph as part of the description. And the item Mr P got 
was significantly different to the photo on the listing for this item.
Mr P had tried to resolve the dispute with the seller, but when that failed, hed asked PayPal
to help. He was still within the deadline of 180 days to do that. Our investigator didnt think
Mr P had raised the dispute too late.
Our investigator thought Mr P had a claim and PayPal should've looked further into this
when it was raised. As the 180 days had now passed she said PayPal should pay Mr P
£276.10 to cover the cost of his purchase.
PayPal said that our investigator hadnt explained why Mr P hadnt spoken to it earlier. It said
it couldnt check, five months after purchase, if the item was in the same condition as when it
was received. So PayPal said it would be unreasonable for it to expect a seller to accept
back an item sold 5 months previously and have to refund the buyer. PayPal also said it
hadnt seen the pictures our investigator based her decision on.
We sent pictures to PayPal, and it said that the photos Mr P was comparing to, were for a
different item hed bought previously. He expected his most recent purchase to be the same.
But PayPal said that failing to meet buyer expectation wasnt a reason for claiming under its
buyer protection policy, as long as the item was correctly described.
Mr P also wrote to us. He said the item was in its original packaging, and the same condition
as it was sent.
Our investigator still didnt think the photos matched what arrived. And the item didnt fit.
Because no agreement had been reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My first provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. I then proposed to uphold the complaint,
because Mr P had brought his claim to PayPal within the deadline it gave, so I thought it
ought to have considered his claim in line with its terms. I said I couldnt be sure that if 
PayPal had done that, it wouldve upheld Mr Ps claim. But I thought it was more likely than
not that it wouldve done. I also thought Mr P had been inconvenienced, so I said PayPal
should pay him some compensation.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision.
Mr P didnt reply. PayPal replied, to make an entirely new point.
My second provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, in the light of the new evidence received. I 
explained why I now only proposed to uphold it in part. This is what I said then: 
PayPal sent two responses. The first said that buyer protection isnt a guarantee, and
PayPal is authorised to take a final decision in the terms of the agreement. But the 
second said something very different. 
PayPals second response said that it appears to have been forgotten that Mr P 
didnt make this payment on his own PayPal account. His full account has had an 
unresolved limitation since 2017, so he made the payment on a guest account.PayPal set out the terms for making a payment without a PayPal account. It said 
those clearly state that PayPal buyer protection is not offered if youre checking out 
on a guest account.
This is entirely new evidence from PayPal. And in the light of this, Ive changed my 
mind. It wouldnt be fair and reasonable to say that PayPal has to refund Mr P the 
£276.10 he paid for this purchase, if he wasnt covered by PayPals buyer protection 
for this purchase. So I wont make any award for that.
But I do think that PayPal ought to have been rather clearer about this, rather sooner 
than this. Mr P has put time and effort into seeking to obtain a refund, and then into 
pursuing this complaint with our service. He didnt need to do any of that, if he simply 
isnt covered by the protection policy hes trying to claim under. So I still think PayPal 
should pay Mr P £100 in compensation.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
PayPal didnt reply. Mr P replied to tell us about the problems hed had with PayPal. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P told us about the reasons why hed not done the job straight away, and the problems 
hed run into when he tried to return the item. He then told us about the problems hed had 
with PayPal when he wanted it to help him get his money back.  
But what PayPal has said now is that Mr P made this payment on a guest account, not an 
account in his name. So he isnt covered by the buyer protection policy. And if Mr P isnt 
covered by that policy, then PayPal could never have helped him get his money back. 
I realise PayPal has wasted a considerable amount of Mr Ps time, which is why I said it 
should pay him £100 compensation. But I cant fairly ask PayPal to refund Mr P for the item 
he bought, under its buyer protection scheme, if Mr P was never covered under the scheme 
for this purchase.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Mr P £100 in 
compensation.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2021.
