The complaint
Mr W complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) for closing his account 
and not re-opening it as he requested. He feels that NatWest has discriminated against him. 
What happened
Mr W held a NatWest account. He last actively used the account in 2015, and it was left with 
a balance of around Â£0.50. 
Mr W did not make any further payments into, or out of his account. 
In 2020, NatWest wrote to him indicating that it considered the account to be dormant. It 
gave him 9 months notice of its intention to close it. 
In October 2020, NatWest closed Mr Ws account.
In March 2022, Mr W contacted NatWest about his account. He was unhappy that it had 
been closed and he wanted it to be re-opened. 
NatWest told Mr W that it could not re-open the account, but that he could complete a form 
for the balance to be reclaimed, or he could open another account. It indicated that he would 
need to attend a branch, and provide identification documents, to open a new account. 
NatWest also said that it could transfer the balance to another account if he gave details. 
Mr W was not happy with this. He felt that it was unfair to expect him to attend a branch as 
he is disabled and has difficulties attending a branch. He felt that the closure of the account 
was discriminatory. 
He contacted us. 
Our investigator has looked into this matter and did not recommend that Mr Ws complaint 
be upheld. She did not think that there was any evidence of discrimination and she had not 
seen evidence that NatWest was even aware of Mr Ws disability when it closed the account. 
Mr W did not accept that view and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Mr W is upset at the closure of his account and he feels that it is 
unreasonable to require him to attend a branch to open a new account. 
I agree, however, with my colleague, that there is no evidence that NatWest has treated him 
unfairly by closing his account. The closure took place in line with the terms and conditions 
and NatWest gave appropriate notice of the decision to close.
I cannot see that any issue was raised with NatWest which would require it to make 
reasonable adjustments. 
NatWest has explained that it is unable to re-open a closed account and I accept this. On 
that basis, I agree with the investigators view and I think that NatWest has acted reasonably 
in the action it has taken to date. 
Consequently, I do not uphold Mr Ws complaint. 
If Mr W wishes to open a new account, and he asks NatWest to facilitate his doing so by 
making adjustments to its process for account opening, I would expect NatWest to consider 
making adjustments to help Mr W. 
If he encounters difficulties then he would be entitled to complain again at that time. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mr Ws complaint and do not ask National 
Westminster Bank Plc to do anything further. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2022.
