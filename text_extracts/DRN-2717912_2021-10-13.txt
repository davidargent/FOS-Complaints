The complaint
Mr C complains about how BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) handled, over 
a number of months, his request for the voluntary termination of his hire purchase 
agreement (agreement).
What happened
in March 2017 Mr C entered into an agreement with VWFS for the acquisition of a new car 
costing £27,834.01. Under the terms of the agreement  everything else being equal  Mr C 
undertook to make an advance payment of £600 followed by 47 monthly payments of 
£396.19 and a final payment (to purchase the car) of £13,288.23 making a total repayable of 
£32,509.16.
The agreement stated that:
You have the right to end this agreement. To do so, you should write to the person you 
make your payments to. They will then be entitled to the return of the goods and half of the 
total amount payable under this agreement, that is £16,254.58. If you have already paid half 
this amount plus any overdue instalments and having taken reasonable care of the goods, 
you will not have to pay any more.
This means that you can terminate this agreement at any time before your final repayment 
falls due by giving us written notice. You will have to return the vehicle and pay (i) any 
arrears and any other sums which have become payable under the agreement before the 
termination (including any Excess Mileage Charge), plus (ii) the amount (if any) by which 
one-half of the total amount payable exceeds the amount paid by you including the advance 
payment plus (iii) if you do not return the vehicle in good repair and condition, the sum 
required to compensate us for this. This will be your maximum liability if you comply with 
these requirements.
And
We will charge you 6.28 pence for each mile in excess of the Maximum Total Mileage 
[32,000 miles]. If you return the vehicle before the end of the agreement, the Total Maximum 
Mileage will be reduced to reflect the shorter period of hire on a pro-rata basis. Your 
obligation to pay any Excess Mileage Charge will accrue immediately prior to your 
termination.
Mr C says he asked to voluntary terminate his agreement in February 2020 and was advised 
by BMWFS that he would need to pay it £95.19 on, or shortly after, doing so. But he 
calculated that he should only have to pay BMWFS £42.
Mr C says he calculated that he only needed to pay £42 by comparing 50% of the total 
payable under the agreement of £16,254.58 with the settlement figure (before any rebate) 
BMWFS provided him under cover of its settlement letter dated 4 February 2020 of 
£16,306.57  a difference of £51.99.
On 3 February 2020 BMWFS sent Mr C two excess mileage charge invoices. One in error  
requesting £1,925.70 and one requesting £1,883.81:
53,997 return miles  0 delivery miles 53,997 miles
24,000 miles (3 years @ 8,000 miles a year) (24,000 miles)
chargeable mileage 29,997 miles
charge per mile 6.28 pence
total charge (29,997 x 6.28 pence) £1,883.81
On 7 February 2020 Mr C complained to our service about the above.
On 7 February 2020 BMWFS sent Mr C a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this 
FRL BMWFS said:
The figure that has been shared with you is correct and there are no hidden costs. You 
have agreed to VT and this cannot be reversed. Once VT is agreed it is a legally binding 
agreement and we will expect the VT figure to be paid.
On 24 February 2020 BMWFS sent Mr C a FRL. Under cover of this FRL BMWFS said 
As per our discussion on the 21 February, we discussed your complaint in full. [We] advised
you that from looking at the agreement, you could have Voluntary Terminated your 
agreement between 7-8 months ago. However you were told on a number of occasions
that you still needed to pay £95.00 to bring you to the 50% point of your total amount
payable, when in fact you didnt.
[We] offered to remove the excess mileage charge from your agreement in full, as a gesture
of goodwill which has been actioned for you, leaving a £0.00 balance. [we] can also confirm,
there has been no impact to your credit file regarding this outstanding amount.
On 24 February 2020 Mr C wrote to us to reiterate his complaint and to say why he felt 
BWMFS offer didnt go far enough.
Mr Cs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
having written off the excess mileage charge (and subsequently the voluntary termination 
shortfall charge) BMWFS had done enough to compensate Mr C for its handling, over a 
number of months, of his request for the voluntary termination of his agreement.
Mr C didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not 
because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
Secondly, I would add that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, as some of its here, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
excess mileage charge
Mr C doesnt dispute BMWFS right to charge excess mileage on the voluntary termination of 
his agreement. However, he disputes the amount charged.
For the avoidance of doubt and for the sake of completeness I would first like to confirm that 
Im satisfied that under the terms of the agreement BMWFS can charge Mr C for the excess 
miles he travelled in the car prior to his decision to voluntary terminate the agreement. And 
because of this Ive simply restricted my consideration to what that charge might fairly look 
like.
Mr C hasnt disputed the return mileage of 53,997, or the 36 months the car was on hire to 
him. So with this in mind, and given that the agreement clearly references an 8,000 miles per 
year allowance and a charge per mile of 6.28 pence, Im satisfied that if the car was 
delivered with zero miles on the clock BMWFS acted entirely appropriately in charging 
Mr C, as it did under cover of an invoice dated 3 February 2020, £1,883.81 for excess 
mileage.
Now Mr C disputes the car would have ever been delivered with zero miles on the clock. 
Now even if I was to accept what Mr C says on this point, from my experience new cars are 
very rarely, if ever, delivered with more than 100 miles on the clock. So even if I was to give 
Mr C the benefit of the car having 100 miles on the clock when it was delivered to him, it 
would still mean that BMWFS was within its rights to charge him £1,877.53 for excess 
mileage  a difference of £6.28 or 100 miles x 6.28 pence.
Had Mr C voluntary terminated his agreement earlier than he did I accept that he would have 
travelled less miles in the car. But equally the allowance he would have been given by 
BMWFS would have been 666 miles less for each and every month he voluntary terminated 
the agreement early by.
voluntary termination shortfall charge
Under the terms of the agreement Mr C needed to have paid BMWFS £16,254.58 to avoid 
having to pay it anything further (excluding excess mileage and damage charges) on 
voluntary termination. 
BMWFS calculated the shortfall to be £95.19 and Mr C says he calculated it to be £42.At the time of voluntary terminating the agreement Mr C had made the following payments:
an advance payment £600.00
8 direct debit payments of £396.19 £3,169.52
1 payment of £1,000.00 £1,000.00
13 direct debit payments of £371.41 £4,828.33
1 payment of £3,500.00 £3,500.00
13 direct debit payments of £232.18 £3,018.34
total £16,116.19
By my calculations this means that on voluntary terminating the agreement Mr C had a 
shortfall to pay of £138.39 (£16,254.58 - £16,116.19). Therefore I dont think that BMWFS 
made any error in its shortfall calculation that was to Mr Cs detriment. By way of clarity it 
would appear that BMWFS calculated a shortfall of £95.19 because it had used, simply in 
error and without varying the terms of the underlying agreement, a lower total sum repayable 
figure of £32,422.76 (rather than £32,509.16) and therefore an incorrect 50% figure of 
£16,211.38 (rather than £16,254.58) giving a shortfall calculation of £95.19 (£16,211.38 - 
£16,116.19).
For the sake of completeness I would add that Im satisfied that contrary to the information 
BMWFS might have given Mr C, he couldnt have voluntary terminated his agreement (with 
nothing further to pay) before March 2020. I would also add that the sum due from a 
customer on voluntary termination of an agreement is set at the outset and never changes.
In calculating what is due from a customer on voluntary termination, and despite what Mr C 
might understand to the contrary, no benefit accrues for interest saved on over payments 
made (although benefit for the capital sum over paid does accrue a benefit). Interest saved 
is simply taken into account by a business when new payments are calculated and set by it  
following an over payment by a customer.
I accept that Mr C could have voluntary terminated sooner than he did. But for each month 
Mr C could have voluntary terminated his agreement early, he would have been required to 
pay a further £232.18. And even had Mr C taken a loan to pay this larger shortfall he would 
have saved very little, if anything, given his agreement was subject to an APR of 5.9%.
summary
I accept that BMWFS service fell short of what Mr C was entitled to expect (both in its 
written communications and during a number of telephone calls that took place) and that he 
was given, on more than one occasion, wrong and/or conflicting information. But Im satisfied 
that BMWFS has done enough to fairly and reasonably compensate Mr C for this.
On voluntary terminating his agreement Im satisfied that Mr C was required to pay at least 
the following to BMWFS:
VT shortfall (BMWFS lower calculation) £95.19
Excess Mileage (allowing for a delivery mileage of 100) £1,877.53
Total £1,972.72
Given that BMWFS cleared Mr Cs account to zero in February/March 2020 (with him having 
nothing further to pay) BMWFS has, in essence, written off at least £1,972.72. And in my 
view this is more than fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.My final decision
My final decision is that having cleared Mr Cs account to zero, in essence writing off at least 
£1,972.72 owed to it, BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited need do nothing further in 
respect of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 November 2021.
