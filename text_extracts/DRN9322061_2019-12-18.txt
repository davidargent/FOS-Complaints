Mr R says Gain Credit  LLC,  trading as Lending  Stream (Lending  Stream) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Lending Stream provided to Mr R between 
August 2012 and June 2015.  Mr Rs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date 
RepaidInstalments* Principal Amount
Highest monthly repayment 
1 12/08/2012 31/01/2013 24 weeks £400.00  £165
2 21/10/2012 14/03/2013 20 weeks £170.00  £242
3 08/03/2013 17/06/2013 24 weeks £315.00  £130
4 14/09/2014 25/09/2014 24 weeks £300.00  £153
5 11/10/2014 23/10/2014 24 weeks £200.00  £102
6 08/12/2014 19/12/2014 24 weeks £480.00  £245
7 23/12/2014 08/05/2015 6 months £250.00  £106
8 06/06/2015 08/10/2015 24 weeks £300.00  £126
* Please note  loan 7 was to be repaid in monthly instalments while the remaining loans 
were to be repaid  in weekly instalments.  
Mr R has said the loans  were unaffordable and had proper  checks been done,  Lending  
Stream would have  seen  that he was in financial  difficulty. Lending Stream  says that 
adequate checks  were carried out before the loans were provided  and based  on these the 
loans were affordable.
There was a gap of over six months  between the repayments of loan 3 and the Mr R 
borrowing loan 4  so the loans from loan 4 onwards form a new chain of borrowing. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint in part and thought the loans 7 and 8 shouldnt 
have been given. Lending Stream accepted this view but Mr R didnt agree. He felt all the 
loans should be refunded  as they were  all unaffordable and should not have been given to 
his because of his financial position. So the complaint has now been  passed to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure     
Ref: DRN93220612Mr R could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Lending Stream asked  Mr R for information  about  his income and expenditure and it carried  
out credit  checks.  Mr R said he earned  £1,600  for loans 1 to 3 but his income  varied 
between £1,200 and £1,680 for loans 4 to 8. Mr R said his monthly outgoings ranged from 
£400 for loans  1 to 3 and from £275  and £950  for loans 4 to 8. The loans were  all 
successfully repaid. 
I think these checks were  proportionate and sufficient for loans 1 to 3. From these checks, it 
looked like Mr R could sustainably repay these loans. So I cant say it was wrong  for Lending  
Stream to provide them. There was a six months  gap in Mr Rs borrowing  this was 
between loan 3 and 4. So I think Lending Stream could reasonably treat loan 4 as the start 
of a new chain  of borrowing and carry out checks that were  appropriate.  
Ref: DRN93220613I think Lending Streams affordability checks for loans 4 to 6 were proportionate and
sufficient. It looked  like Mr R had sufficient  disposable income to repay  the loans. 
Given the loan amounts,  what  was apparent about Mr Rs circumstances  at the time and his
history with Lending Stream, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate to ask him for the
amount of information  needed to show the lending was unsustainable. There wasnt  anything
in the information Mr R provided about  his outgoings  or the information Lending Stream  
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
Mr R has said about his financial  position.  So I cant say it was wrong for Lending Stream  to 
provide loans 4 to 6.
Mr R has said the credit check would have shown Lending Stream that the loans should not 
have been given to him. Ive thought about this carefully. 
The information Lending Stream saw wasnt exactly the same  as what  Mr R may have seen 
on his actual credit report. While Mr R would have access to his full credit report  which  would 
have specific details  in it, Lending Stream would only get access  to certain portions of the 
credit report.  For example, Lending Stream was only aware of headline information  like the 
number of active accounts and the number of defaults. And based on the results  that 
Lending Stream has provided, while it was aware  of some adverse information,  at the point 
loan 4 was approved, I don' think those  headlines  wouldve raised  any concerns at the time. 
So to illustrate this - Mr R has mentioned a default with another  short term lender but based  
on the checks undertaken by Lending Stream, it would not have known what the defaults 
were for. 
Based on the credit  information Lending  Stream  had available,  I dont  think this on its own 
wouldve led it to decline the applications  for credit. Mr R didnt have lots of outstanding  
credit or lots of active accounts. So while Lending Stream  was aware of two defaults  that 
had been recorded within the gap between loans 3 and 4, I dont think it would have led 
Lending Stream to automatically decline the loans or be prompted  to ask Mr R further 
questions. 
So, I dont think Lending Stream  was wrong  to provided loans 4 to 6, solely  based  on the 
information it gathered  from the credit reference agency. In addition, I dont think  it had any 
reason to doubt the information  Mr R gave  it when he applied for the loans.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 7 and 8 would most likely have 
shown that Mr R was having problems in managing  his money. Lending Stream has agreed 
to put things right for loans 7 and 8 and I agree that this is a fair outcome. 
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
So in line with what Lending Stream has already  agreed to do;
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 7 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN93220614remove any negative information  about loans 7 and 8 from Mr Rs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest.  
Lending Stream must give Mr R a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 January 2020.
