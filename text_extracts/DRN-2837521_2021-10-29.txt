The complaint
Mr S complains about his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal). 
What happened
Mr S made 11 payments totalling around £11,000 from his bank account to a spread betting 
company, via his PayPal account. 
After losing the full amount he used for trades, Mr S didnt have the funds to cover the 
losses, so he called his bank and asked for the payments to be rejected. This meant instead 
of his bank account being in a negative balance (and an unauthorised overdraft) it took his 
PayPal account in a negative balance instead. 
Mr S complained to PayPal, as he said the payments shouldnt been authorised by PayPal 
when the funds werent available. Mr S has also said PayPal shouldve had safe guarding 
protection in place to stop him from using such a high amount of money. Mr S asked PayPal 
to write off the £11,150.00 he now owes it.
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt agree it had acted unfairly. PayPal said it is a 
user-initiated service which doesnt have access to Mr Ss bank account, or balances to 
check available funds. It said Mr S initiated the transactions and on that basis they were 
paid. PayPal went on to say that Mr S agreed to the terms and conditions of the account 
when he opened it, and this gave PayPal continuous authority to send money from his bank 
account. Mr S remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. Our investigator found that 
Mr S accepted PayPals terms and conditions when he opened his account, and one of 
those terms was that he gave PayPal continuous permission to charge his funding source  
in this case his bank account. He went on to say that as Mr S had initiated the payments, the 
onus was on him to make sure there were funds available in his bank account to cover the 
transactions. Lastly our investigator didnt find any evidence of Mr S making PayPal aware of 
his spread betting problems for the duration that he has had the account, so he didnt think 
PayPal had acted unfairly by allowing the transactions through. 
Mr S responded to our investigators view. He said
He had mentioned his spread betting addiction to PayPal in the past. Although it may 
have been in a passing conversation. 
PayPal should have people trained to pick up on issues like his spread betting 
without the need to highlight it. 
He has lost a considerable amount of money over the years he has been spread 
betting and has never made any money back. 
He has never seen the user agreement  so he is not bound by it.
PayPal is in breach of all of the FCAs principals.
By allowing a continuous line of funding, PayPal are irresponsibly lending money.
PayPal didnt complete any anti money laundering or ID checks when he opened the 
account.  
Our investigator considered the further points Mr S raised but didnt change his view. So, the 
complaints been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from Mr Ss comments to our service that he feels very strongly about his 
complaint. And Ive read all the information he has sent carefully. Having done so, Ive 
decided not to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why. 
When Mr S signed up to his PayPal account, he agreed to a set of terms and conditions. 
One of those terms and conditions which I have seen, was to allow PayPal to make 
payments from Mr Ss nominated banking account when he initiates them- as it has done 
with the transactions in this complaint. So, I dont find PayPal have breached any terms or 
conditions when they have made the payments, or that it has acted unfairly by doing so. 
The user agreement goes on to say. 
We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed. If you cancel any 
continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any 
electronic money weve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains 
outstanding.
So, based on the above, even though Mr S cancelled the payments from his nominated bank 
account  he is still liable to pay the amount PayPal sent to the spread betting company. 
Mr S has said that PayPal shouldve realised what the transactions were for and stopped 
them from being paid. But I dont agree. PayPal may prevent a payment if the user is in 
breach of their user agreement. I cant see that this happened here. It worth noting that 
PayPal also wouldnt have known what the payments in this transaction were for, just the 
name of the business they were going to. So, I dont find PayPal have acted outside of its 
terms and conditions or acted unfairly by not stopping the payments. At the point the 
payments were made, PayPal also wouldnt have been aware that the money was being 
lost, and this is also not something they needed to be aware of. 
Mr S said he made PayPal aware of his spread betting issue on the telephone before the 
payments in this complaint were made. Although weve not seen any record of this from 
PayPal, and Mr S hasnt been able to supply any record of when these calls were made  I 
dont find this would have an impact in the circumstances of this complaint. It would need to 
be Mr Ss bank that prevented the payments from being made, as this is where they 
originated from. 
Mr S has said PayPal is in breach of Financial Conduct Association (FCA) principles and 
regulations. Having reviewed Mr Ss complaint in detail, I havent found PayPal have acted 
outside any FCA principles or other regulations. As Ive explained above, PayPal made a 
payment Mr S initiated.
I understand Mr S has said PayPal have lent money irresponsibly by allowing the 
transactions to go through. But PayPal havent lent Mr S any money. Mr Ss PayPal account 
is only in a negative balance as his bank reversed the transactions. After the investigators view, Mr S raised concerns about the fact he was allowed to open the 
account without any ID checks or money laundering checks. On this occasion, unless Mr S 
did open the account fraudulently, I dont find this would have impact on this complaint. And 
Mr S hasnt highlighted to our service that this is the case. 
In summary, Mr S instructed PayPal to make the payments from his bank account to the 
third party spread betting company. And I havent found PayPal have done anything wrong 
when they have allowed the payments to go through. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 November 2021.
