K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs T have  complained that Bank  of Scotland Plc, trading as Halifax, will not refund 
any commission it received from their payment protection insurance (PPI) premiums  for the 
policy they took out in 1998.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To be clear, my decision  only deals with Mr and Mrs Ts complaint about commission.  Thats 
because a colleague of mine has already decided we are unable to consider Mr and Mrs Ts 
complaint about  the mis-sale of the PPI in a decision on 20 December  2018.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr and Mrs Ts complaint  about the commission. Ill explain why 
below.
In 2017, following a Supreme Court judgment, the Financial  Conduct  Authority (FCA), 
issued some rules about how businesses should deal with complaints about  the 
non-disclosure of commission where PPI was sold. 
The FCA said that if a business got a high level of commission and profit share  from the PPI 
policy  more than 50% of the PPI premium  and it didnt tell the consumer, then that could 
create an unfair relationship between the parties.  So to put that right, the FCA said that 
businesses should  pay back  the amount of commission and profit share  that was more than 
50% of the PPI premium.
But these  rules and the Supreme Court judgment relate to the unfair relationship  provisions 
in the Consumer Credit  Act 1974. The unfair relationship provisions  which  were  added to 
the Consumer  Credit Act in 2006  came into force on 6 April 2007. The changes  made in 
2006 explained that the unfair relationship  provisions would only apply to credit  agreements 
taken out on or after 6 April 2007, or agreements taken out before then, which were still 
running on 6 April 2008.
Halifax has sent us information that shows Mr and Mrs Ts mortgage was taken out in 1998  
and ended in 2000. So it wasnt taken out on or after 6 April 2007  or still running on 
6 April 2008. And so based on what Ive said above,  I dont think the unfair relationship 
provisions in the Consumer Credit  Act, the Supreme Court  judgment,  or the rules and 
guidance made by the FCA in relation to the non-disclosure of commission  apply here.
So Halifax  doesnt  need to refund any of the commission Mr and Mrs T paid for the PPI they 
had with their mortgage.
