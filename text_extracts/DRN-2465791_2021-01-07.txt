The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Limited (NewDay) sold his debt to a debt collection agency 
without giving notice and while an agreed payment plan was in place. 
What happened
Mr C had a loan account with NewDay and due to a change in his financial circumstances he 
agreed with them a payment plan. Mr C says a few days following the payment plan being 
agreed he received a letter from NewDay informing him his debt had been sold to a third-
party debt provider. 
Mr C says he was never told of this previously and wants NewDay to take back the loan and 
the payment plan that was agreed, put back in place. 
NewDay says that the arrangement to sell the debt to a third party was already in place and 
they shouldnt have agreed to the payment plan arrangements. NewDay say while this 
should have been explained to Mr C, when he called to discuss the payment plan, they have 
acted correctly and in line with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, given the 
loan was in arrears. NewDay have offered Mr C £75 by way of an apology for not making 
this clear to him when he telephoned them.
The investigator looked at all the information available but didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
The investigator says that Mr C was in arrears despite the payment  plan being in place and 
the formal notices were issued in line with NewDays obligations under the terms and 
conditions of the loan agreement. 
Mr C wasnt happy with the investigators view and felt the compensation offered wasnt 
sufficient and asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said : 
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision.
I can see it would be upsetting and frustrating for Mr C to receive a notice he was in default 
and his debt had been sold to a new debt provider after he had agreed a payment plan with 
NewDay. 
What happened here was Mr C found himself in financial difficulties and initially contacted  
New Day about this in April 2019 and the account was frozen pending completion of an 
income and expenditure profile. Following a series of missed phone calls and letters sent, 
NewDay received an income and expenditure profile from Mr C in June 2019. NewDay wrote 
back to Mr C asking him to contact them about this as they believed he wouldnt be able to 
meet his offer of payments of circa £100 per month.
Mr C then contacted NewDay in August 2019  and during the phone call, with NewDays 
collection team, a payment plan of £50 per month was agreed for six months, starting in 
October 2019. What happened here was the same day the payment plan was approved, 
NewDay sent out a Notice of Termination and a few days later sold the debt to a third-party 
debt provider. 
Mr C queried this with NewDay a couple of weeks later and was told that his loan debt had 
been sold. NewDay says while they shouldnt have accepted a payment plan previously, 
they are within their rights to sell on the debt under the terms and conditions of the loan 
agreement, given the loan was in arrears. NewDay accept they should have been clearer 
with Mr C when he discussed the payment plan and offered him £75 by way of an apology.
I have considered the information provided by both parties here. Its worth mentioning that 
while Mr C didnt believe his account was in arrears, I have listened to telephone 
conversations between him and NewDay and during these calls it was made clear to him 
that despite any payment plan in place his loan debt would remain in arrears. I am satisfied 
this was correct and NewDay advised Mr C of his arrears in a letter dated June 2019  and in 
the notice of default in July 2019. So, I cant say that Mr C wasnt made aware of his arrears 
position.
I accept, NewDay like most banks, can give notice of default under the terms and conditions 
of the loan agreement (11.3) and have the right to sell the debt to another debt provider, 
without formal notice if those terms are unaltered.  What is different here is NewDays own 
collection team had specifically agreed over the telephone and subsequently in writing to Mr 
C a payment plan for six months. The fact that the same day another part of the business 
had issued a Notice of Termination was counter to what had been agreed with Mr C and 
even though they accept this was an error on their part, I cant see that Mr C should be 
affected by this mistake. 
I havent had access to the terms and conditions the new debt provider have offered or if this 
is the same as agreed in August 2019, but nevertheless, NewDay should have allowed Mr C 
to commence the payment plan for a reasonable period of time before passing the debt to 
another debt provider. 
To put matters right NewDay should now take back the loan from the debt provider to whom 
it was sold and agree a payment plan that suits Mr Cs current financial circumstances, in 
addition to the compensation they have already offered.  
While NewDay will be disappointed with my decision, I am satisfied this is a fair resolution to 
the complaint. 
Both Mr C and NewDay have responded to my decision, so the case has been passed back 
to me to a make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I gave both Mr C and NewDay until 25 December 2020 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. NewDay have come back and have accepted in part my provisional decision in that 
they have agreed to pay the compensation payment of £75. NewDay have made the point 
there is little benefit in returning the debt from the new debt provider as they are specialist in 
their field and are sympathetic in their approach and will be able to agree the most 
appropriate level of support suitable to Mr C.  I have given this further thought and given Mr Cs financial circumstances, I am now of the view  the transfer of the debt back to NewDay 
will only serve to create more inconvenience for him. Its also fair to say the new debt 
providers are as well placed to offer a workable payment plan as NewDay, so there seems 
little point, on reflection, in creating any further inconvenience for Mr C here, in transferring 
the debt back. 
This option was put to Mr C who has accepted this, as he feels the matter has gone on long 
enough. Mr C doesnt feel the compensation offered by NewDay is sufficient but as I have 
explained in my provisional decision the compensation awarded is to reflect a mistake made 
by NewDay when advising him over the telephone a payment plan would be agreed when it 
had already been decided to transfer the debt to a new debt provider. I maintain this is a fair 
amount of compensation here, given the reasons I have previously mentioned.
 Mr C should now contact the new debt providers to establish a suitable payment plan.
Putting things right
I instruct NewDay Limited to pay Mr C £75 for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I instruct NewDay Limited to pay Mr C £75 
for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2021.
