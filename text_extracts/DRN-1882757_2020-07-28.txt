The complaint
Ms B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined her chargeback 
claim as it was raised too late.
What happened
Ms B bought a package holiday, but only the deposit was refunded when the holiday 
provider collapsed. Ms B pursued the matter through ATOL but was later advised to contact 
her bank to raise a chargeback.
Ms B contacted NatWest on 31 March 2020 and requested that a chargeback be raised for 
the transaction that took place on 14 August 2019, she was told that the claim wasnt raised 
because it was outside the time limits.
Ms B wasnt aware of the timescales and felt that NatWest couldnt expect her to have raised 
the claim within time. She requested a refund of the full amount, which NatWest declined.
Our investigator didnt uphold Ms Bs complaint. She felt that NatWest acted fairly when 
rejecting the chargeback and couldnt be held responsible for Ms B not knowing the 
timescales that applied. Our investigator explained that NatWest was correctly following the 
chargeback rules made by the global card organisation that issued her debit card. NatWest 
also couldnt be held responsible for delays other organisations may have caused to Ms Bs 
claim.
Ms B disagreed with our investigators view. She said that the holiday provider shouldve 
done more to advise her of the chargeback timescales and that her ATOL certificate didnt 
contain any details about timescales. She explained that due to her anxiety she followed the 
instructions to wait for her refund instead of contacting NatWest. She requested that our 
investigator come to an agreement with ATOL and that not knowing the timescales should 
mean that NatWest help her further.
Our investigator explained we would only be able to investigate NatWests actions, and that 
her opinion remained that NatWest had acted fairly.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont feel that NatWest has acted unfairly in this instance. I appreciate that 
Ms B will be disappointed by this outcome. But Id like to explain how Ive reached it in more 
detail.
My role is to consider whether NatWest made a mistake regarding Ms Bs chargeback, and 
whether it dealt with the request fairly. Ms B has raised several points relating to other 
organisations who she feels have misadvised her  and I can see this has had a very real 
impact on her health. But our authority when assessing this complaint is to investigate NatWest. It wouldnt be fair to hold NatWest responsible for the actions or impact of a third 
party, just as it wouldnt be fair to hold Ms B responsible for them.
Looking at what Ms B has told us, I have no doubt that she was unaware of the timescales 
that were in place for her to make a chargeback claim  or that she wasnt informed of these 
timescales prior to contacting NatWest. But I must consider whether NatWest failed in any 
obligations it had to Ms B, and whether it followed the chargeback process correctly for her 
situation.
Our investigator explained the chargeback process and time limits involved  but Ill repeat 
these for clarity. The chargeback process enables customers to ask their card issuer to 
reverse payments on their card when there is a problem concerning a specific transaction. 
Individual card issuers have their own rules around how the scheme works  these are not 
set by the customers bank.
The card issuer for Ms Bs transaction was Visa. Its rules state that a chargeback request 
needs to be raised within 120 days from the date that the cardholder expected to receive the 
service, or when the cardholder was first made aware that the services would not be 
provided.
The rules dont state that the customer must be aware of the chargeback process for the 
timescales to start. And NatWest has no ability to change these rules  a request cant be 
raised outside the time frames that Visa sets out.
Ms Bs chargeback request was raised with NatWest on 31 March 2020. The holiday 
provider stopped trading on 23 September 2019, but Ms B wouldve been aware at the latest 
that their services wouldnt be provided when the deposit was refunded on 14 October 2019. 
This means the claim fell outside of the timescales by at least 49 days.
I can see that Ms B had good reasons for not contacting NatWest sooner  she was 
unaware that there was a timescale and the process had already caused her a great amount 
of anxiety and upset. Unfortunately, these reasons dont eliminate the timeframes that apply 
to the process, nor do they enable NatWest to lodge a chargeback outside of these 
timescales.
By the time Ms B contacted NatWest to request a refund it was already too late for a 
chargeback to be made. It would be unfair to expect NatWest to have advised Ms B of the 
timescales sooner  NatWest wasnt aware of the issue until Ms B told it, by which point it 
was too late. 
For the reasons Ive explained I cant say that NatWest acted unfairly by refusing to raise the 
chargeback out of time. It wouldnt be fair for me to ask that NatWest refund the amount Ms 
B has lost out on because I dont feel that NatWest are responsible for her loss.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2020.
