Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 7 to 13. She said 
that by loan 7, Sunny  should  have realised that Mr L was having difficulties managing  his 
money and that he may not have  been able to sustainably  repay  his loans. She thought that 
by loan 9, the pattern of Mr Ls borrowing suggested  that hed become persistently reliant on 
short term lending. She recommended  that Sunny reimburse all of the interest and charges 
Mr L had paid towards loans 7 to 13. She also said that it should  remove adverse 
information from his credit file in respect  of loans  7 and 8. She thought loans 9 to 13 should 
be removed from his file completely.  
Sunny didnt agree with that view. Another of our adjudicators looked at the matter.  Although  
he agreed that Sunny shouldnt have provided loans 7 to 13, he thought the way it should 
put things right should change slightly. He recommended that Sunny remove all of the 
interest and charges Mr L paid towards  loans  7 to 13. But that adverse information should  be 
removed from the credit  file completely in respect  of loans 7 to 11. He thought  all of the 
information about loans 12 and 13 should  be removed from Mr Ls credit file.  
As neither party responded to our adjudicators latest view, the matter has been passed to 
me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN76214182complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Looking at the pattern of borrowing, I can see that almost a year and a half had passed  
between Mr L borrowing loan 3 and loan 4. So Ive treated loans 1 to 3 and loans 4 to 13 as 
two separate chains  of lending. 
Neither party has disputed what our adjudicators said in respect  of loans  1 to 6. So I havent 
considered further  whether Sunny was irresponsible when it agreed to provide these loans. 
However, I have kept this borrowing in mind when considering the rest of the complaint. 
Ref: DRN76214183I agree  with our adjudicators that Sunny should  have done  more by loan 7. Mr L had taken 
out four loans  in just over six weeks. He applied for loan 5 around a week after he repaid 
loan 4. He took out loans 6 and 7 the same  day as repaying the previous borrowing. I think 
that should have put Sunny on notice that Mr L was struggling financially. As I said above, 
Sunny needed  to do a proportionate  check. And with what it knew about the way Mr L 
managed his loans,  I think it would have  been  proportionate to undertake a full review  of his 
financial circumstances at that time. 
Had that full review been undertaken, I think Sunny  would have appreciated that Mr Ls 
financial commitments  were  greater than it realised. I can see that he had a number of 
personal loans  and other short-term lending commitments. Taking account of his income  at 
that time,  I dont think Sunny could have  reasonably  said that Mr L could sustainably afford 
to repay  loans 7 to 11. 
 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that was the case,  Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt  have  
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I agree with our second adjudicator that 
this point was reached  by loan 12.  I say this because:
By loan 12, Sunny  should have known Mr L was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. He had taken out 9 loans in just over six months.  So Sunny should have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr L was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his  finances  and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The first loan in this chain of borrowing  loan was for £500 and loan 12 was for £350.  
At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr L was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr L was provided with loan 12 within a week after settling loan 11. He took loan 13 
out on the same day as settling loan 12.  
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 13 was 
taken out 6 months after loan 4 (the first loan in this chain). And it was for a larger  
amount. He had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny  
over an extended period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 11 and loans 12 to 13. Sunny  must 
take action to put things right.
Ref: DRN76214184putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 7 to 13. 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 7 to 11 from Mr Ls credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 12 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 12 and 13 should  be removed from 
Mr Ls credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Ls complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2020.
