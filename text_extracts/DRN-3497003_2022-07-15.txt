The complaint
Mr Bs complaint is about a declined buyer protection claim with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA (PayPal).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts of the complaint are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons. 
The buyer dispute for a goods not as described case was raised after the computer 
had been returned to the seller and without being authorised by PayPal. The 
computer was sent back in February 2021 and the claim raised with PayPal on 20 
April 2021. 
The dispute was originally raised through the buying platform and the return address 
provided by them. When PayPal attempted to check the tracking information, it didnt 
provide evidence of the computer being returned. Ive not seen any evidence that 
PayPal did provide a return address. 
Mr B sent PayPal a note to say that he sent the item through another provider but 
with no tracking information included. 
PayPal asked for more information on several occasions and has evidenced that 
these requests were not responded to. On that basis the claim was closed. 
Mr B has suggested throughout his complaint that his complaint is with the selling 
platform and not with PayPal. This is because the selling platform advertised a 90 
day returns policy. 
In summary and based on the information Ive seen from both parties; it appears Mr Bs 
complaint needs to be directed to the selling site, as this is where he was provided with an 
address to send the computer back and a possible returns policy.
I can understand Mr Bs frustration, but unfortunately, he has arranged a return outside of 
the buyer protection PayPal offers. Mr B was also unable to provide valid tracking 
information when asked. And for that reason, I dont find PayPal have acted outside of its 
terms or unfairly when it has declined the claim. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
