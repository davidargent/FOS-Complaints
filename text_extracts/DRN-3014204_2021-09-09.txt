The complaint
Mr L and Miss M complain that U K Insurance Limited (UKI) has delayed settling a claim 
under a travel insurance policy.
What happened
Miss M held a travel insurance policy through her bank account. The insurer was UKI, and 
the policy also covered her partner.
While abroad, Mr L was hospitalised in January 2020 for a few days. The discharge notes on 
10 January 2020 said he shouldnt fly for four weeks  so until 7 February 2020. But he was 
due to fly back to the UK on 5 February 2020. Mr L says he arranged his own return flight for 
a few days after he was fit to fly again because UKI wasnt helpful.
Mr L complained to UKI on 5 March 2020 about the delay in settling the claim and the 
customer service received. Mr L said theyd already sent all the information needed to settle 
the claim.
UKI looked through everything Mr L and Miss M had sent and noted that several pieces of 
information were still missing. UKI wrote to Miss M on 16 March 2020 and said it couldnt 
progress the claim until further information was received. UKI said it still needed (in short):
Receipts for everything being claimed.
If claiming for a partner who is not an account holder, evidence of living at the same 
address.
The booking invoice, showing the date the trip was booked, the intended travel dates 
and the name of each traveller.
Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss.
If claiming for additional travel or accommodation costs, the booking invoice showing 
travel dates, the name of each traveller and the costs being claimed.
A medical certificate completed and stamped by the treating medical professional, 
and release of information form.
The medical report from the doctor who provided treatment and medical invoices.
UKI sent its final response letter to Mr L on 7 April 2020. It acknowledged that there had 
been issues with the service Mr L received from UKIs emergency assistance team, and 
more couldve been done to contact Mr Ls GP before he was fit to fly home. UKI paid £100 
as compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. It also said the claims team 
had been in touch to confirm what else was needed to progress the claim.
Mr L phoned UKI on 23 May 2020 unhappy about the delays and said UKI already had all 
the information to settle the claim. UKI said the medical information from Mr Ls GP was still 
missing. Mr L sent this to UKI on 18 June 2020. But on 14 July 2020 UKI wrote to Miss M 
that it still needed proof of travel from the UK and back confirming travelling dates, 
passenger names and the cost, as well as invoices for medical expenses.
Mr L and Miss M havent sent any further information to UKI. They maintain that theyve sent 
everything UKI needs to settle the claim. UKI, on the other hand, maintains that it hasnt 
received everything it needs and has asked for.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He thought it was reasonable for UKI to ask for 
more information to settle the claim, and he hadnt seen that this had been received by UKI. 
Our investigator acknowledged there had been some service issues and delays caused by 
UKI. But he thought the £100 UKI paid fairly compensated Mr L and Miss M for any distress 
and inconvenience caused.
Mr L and Miss M didnt agree with our investigators findings. As no agreement was reached, 
the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Industry rules set out by the regulator (the Financial Conduct Authority) say insurers must 
handle claims fairly and shouldnt unreasonably reject a claim. Ive taken these rules, and 
other industry guidance, into account when deciding what I think is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of Mr L and Miss Ms complaint. 
The terms of the policy say its for Mr L and Miss M to provide the information and evidence 
that UKI needs to settle the claim. Considering the condition Mr L was hospitalised for, I 
think it was reasonable for UKI to seek to obtain Mr Ls medical history from his GP before 
settling the claim. This is because the policy excludes cover for pre-existing medical 
conditions that havent been declared and accepted by UKI.
Ive looked through the information UKI has received from Mr L and Miss M, and what UKI 
has said it needs to settle the claim. Firstly, I think UKIs letter dated 16 March 2020 sets out 
clearly what information and evidence is needed. For example, I can see that Miss M had 
sent UKI a copy of her original travel itinerary, which included the cost. But I cant see the 
original booking invoice in the name of Mr L, and I cant see any invoices for the new flights 
being claimed for.
The policy covers additional travel expenses  so only an invoice of the original flight 
wouldnt be enough for UKI to settle a claim for this, as the cost of the original flight isnt 
something the insurer would pay. Mr L and Miss M always needed to get home, so they 
always had to pay for a return flight. The policy only covers the additional expenses, as long 
as theres been an insured event.
I can also see that UKI has copies of several medical reports for Mr L. But none of these 
include any costs or show that any payments were made. So, I think its reasonable for UKI 
to ask Mr L and Miss M for invoices for medical expenses.
I accept that there have been some delays on UKIs part, and it wasnt clear on 23 May 2020 
what information is needed to settle the claim. But I cant ignore the fact that UKI has been 
clear about what information is needed on 16 March 2020, and again on 14 July 2020, and 
Mr L and Miss M havent provided the information.Taking everything into account, I think the £100 UKI has already paid to compensate Mr L 
and Miss M for any distress and inconvenience caused is fair and reasonable compensation 
in the circumstances of this complaint. I also think the information UKI is asking Mr L and 
Miss M to provide before it continues to consider the claim is fair and reasonable. So, I dont 
think UKI needs to do anything else until this is received.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr L and Miss Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L and Miss M 
to accept or reject my decision before 13 October 2021.
