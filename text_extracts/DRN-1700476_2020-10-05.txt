The complaint
Mr L complains that Santander UK plc wont refund to him the £2,355 that he paid, using his 
credit card, for a caravan park site licence fee.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the investigator said that Mr L reasonably expected that he could stay in his caravan 
from the end of February until the end of November but in 2018 he couldnt occupy it 
until mid-March  so she recommended that Santander should refund to him £134.58 
which she calculated to be the fee that he paid for the two week period that he wasnt 
able to use the caravan;
Santander has agreed to pay the refund to Mr Ls bank account but Mr L says that he 
should receive a full refund of the licence fee and additional compensation for the two 
weeks that he wasnt able to use the caravan  he also says that he felt that he 
couldn't carry on at the park as his relationship with it had broken down so he sold 
his caravan back to it at a loss and has incurred other losses;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ls complaint about Santander, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Santanders response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ls claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mr L used his Santander credit card to pay the 2018 licence fee in February 2018 on 
the understanding that hed be able to stay in the caravan from the end of February 
until the end of November as hed done in previous years;
because of a planning dispute between the park and the local council he wasnt able 
to stay in the caravan until mid-March  about two weeks later than hed expected  
but the park was then available for him to use;
I sympathise with Mr L for the frustration and upset that he clearly feels and that led 
to him feeling that he could no longer stay at the site, but it was his choice not to fully 
use the licence that hed paid for;
Im not persuaded that the 2018 licence was misrepresented to Mr L and I dont 
consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Santander to refund the 
full licence fee to him; 
Mr L wasnt able to stay in the caravan for about two weeks and I consider that the 
investigators recommendation that Santander should refund to him £135.48, which 
Santander has accepted, is fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Santander to 
pay any other compensation to Mr L - or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Santander to transfer to Mr Ls bank account 
compensation of £134.58 as described above.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part and I order Santander UK plc to pay him 
£134.58.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2020.
