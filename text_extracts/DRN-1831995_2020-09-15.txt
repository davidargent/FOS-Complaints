Our adjudicator upheld Mr Gs complaint in part and thought loans 5-30 shouldnt have been 
given. Ferratum didnt agree. Instead it made an offer that was not in line with our 
adjudicators view. It offered to repay the interest and charges for loans 6-9 and 13-29. Mr G 
declined this offer.
So, as the two parties are not in agreement, Mr Gs complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Ferratum needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Ferratum should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Ferratum was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because initially the Office of Fair Trading and then latterly the FCA through 
its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
complaint. 
I agree with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there was nothing to indicate 
Ferratum needed to do more when it approved loans 1-4. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Mr G had told Ferratum. So, I dont think Ferratum was 
wrong to give these four loans to Mr G.
But I dont think the checks Ferratum says it carried out were enough for loan 5. This was 
now the fifth time in around 6 months that Mr G had asked to lend from Ferratum, and the 
amounts Mr G was asking for, were not reducing at all. I think at this stage, Ferratum 
should have taken greater care to ensure that Mr Gs finances were stable enough to 
support another loan. So, I dont think it was reasonable for Ferratum to base its 
affordability checks only on what Mr G was telling it about his finances.
Instead before lending to Mr G loan 5, Ferratum ought to have taken steps to establish what 
other short-term lending commitments he held at that time. Had it done a proportionate 
check for loan 5, it would have shown Mrs D was struggling to manage his money. At the 
time Mr G asked for loan 5, he had at least 3 outstanding short-term loans provided from 
other lenders. So, on seeing this I dont think Ferratum would have granted loan 5. So, it 
follows that I dont think it was right that Ferratum did agree this loan or any other loan 
taken out after this point.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Ferratums lending history with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point within this lending chain at which Ferratum should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Ferratum 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached at loan 
8. I say this because:
At this point Ferratum ought to have realised Mr G was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr G had taken out and repaid 9 loans in 12 months and was 
asking for his tenth loan in this time. So Ferratum ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mr G was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Ferratum. The amount 
Mr G had requested by the time he asked for loan 10 had not reduced at all. He had 
asked for a similar amount for a tenth time. Ferratum ought to have known that Mr G 
was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an 
ongoing need. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to 
Ferratum over an extended period of time.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted Ferratum to the likelihood that Mr G 
was having problems managing his money. I think that Ferratum shouldve been 
concerned that Mr G might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr G lost out because Ferratum continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
because:These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Gs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, for the reasons I have given above, Im upholding Mr Gs complaint about loans 5-30 
and Ferratum now need to put things right.
Putting things right
Refund all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 5-30;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove all negative information recorded on Mr Gs credit file for loans 5-7;
The number of loans taken from loans 8-30 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse, so all entries about these should be removed from Mr Gs credit file.
Mr G still owes Ferratum some of the principal balance he borrowed on loan 30. Ferratum 
may deduct the outstanding balance of loan 30 from the compensation that is due to him. 
But, to be clear, that outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and 
charges, whilst taking account of any repayments Mr G has made on that loan as though 
they were applied against the principal sum borrowed.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Ferratum to take off tax from this interest. Ferratum must give   
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Gs complaint. Ferratum UK Ltd should pay 
Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
