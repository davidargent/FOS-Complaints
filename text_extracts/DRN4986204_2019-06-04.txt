K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc(NatWest) failed to tell her that she 
would be charged  interest  and charges  on a repayment plan that she agreed with it.
background
Miss B agreed a repayment plan,  on her overdraft, of £40 a month in April 2018.  She says at 
no stage was she told by NatWest that she would  also be responsible  for charges  and 
interest every month. Miss B says that she found  out in 2019 that the overdraft hadnt  been 
cleared as it should have as NatWest was charging her those fees. She would  like the 
interest and charges stopped and refunded.
NatWest says it agreed the plan but told Miss B on a number of occasions when it agreed it 
that she would be responsible for the usage  fee and interest. It says Miss B agreed to that 
and it discussed  other  options with her, but by September 2018 the plan had been  broken. 
NatWest says it wrote to Miss B to tell her that but says she didnt contact it.
Miss B says she didnt  receive that letter  and brought her complaint  to us. Our investigator  
didnt think NatWest had made a mistake and had treated Miss Bs position positively and 
sympathetically. The investigator listened  to the call between the parties  when the plan was 
agreed. And thought Miss B had been told on a number of occasions that she would need to 
pay the monthly charge and interest  as well as the £40. The investigator thought Miss B had 
declined the option to receive account updates by text and couldnt hold NatWest  
responsible for Miss B not receiving her mail.
Miss B doesnt accept  that view and says shes been badly treated by NatWest  and that its 
not prepared to help her.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for the same reasons. I realise Miss B will be disappointed by 
my decision.
Ive listened to the call between the parties  when the repayment  plan was agreed.  Im 
satisfied that NatWest was trying  to help Miss B at that time and so was acting positively and 
sympathetically as I would expect in those circumstances  of financial difficulty. Im also 
satisfied that NatWest went through different options  with Miss B and it was agreed that the 
plan would be set up. I find that on a number of occasions during the call Miss B was told 
about the usage fee and interest  and that those payments needed to be made in addition to 
the £40. I also think  that Miss B understood that, as she says during the call when told about 
them thats fine. So I dont think NatWest made a mistake by applying the fee and interest  
and I think it explained  that to Miss B and that she agreed to it. 
I dont think Miss B kept to the terms of the agreement and so I dont think NatWest  acted 
unfairly by writing to Miss B to tell her that and to ask her to contact it to discuss  the plan. I 
appreciate Miss B says she didnt receive that letter but thats not something I can fairly hold 
NatWest responsible for as it isnt responsible for the delivery of mail.  I would also have 
expected Miss B to have monitored her account  in any event.
Ref: DRN49862042Overall Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt made a mistake or treated Miss B unfairly.  For the 
reasons Ive explained Im satisfied it told Miss B on a number of occasions about the 
charges and interest and that Miss B appeared to understand that. I appreciate Miss B says 
she doesnt wish to speak  to NatWest about this matter. But I hope  she either reconsiders 
that view or takes  advice  from an organisation that could help with any debt problems. I say 
that as NatWests obligation  to treat any case of financial  difficulty  positively and 
sympathetically is ongoing.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 July 2019.
