The complaint
Mr K complains that National Westminster bank Plc blocked and closed his account. Mr K 
would like compensation and a reason.
What happened
Mr K had an account with NatWest. 
Mr K said on 2 September 2022 he was unable to use his card when he was out shopping. 
NatWest didnt give him a reason for this when he called them. Eventually Mr K was told to 
go into branch with his Identification documents.
Mr K went into branch on 3 September 2022. He was told he would have to wait for a letter 
to arrive in the post.
Mr K has said that this was his main account, and he supported his wife, baby daughter and 
his mother who is disabled. He said he was very embarrassed when his card was declined in 
the shop.
Mr K was given access to his funds on 9 September 2022.
Mr K received a letter on 9 November 2022 informing him the bank was giving him 60 days 
notice of the closure of his account.
Mr K complained. NatWest looked at Mr Ks complaint they said they were entitled to review 
and block the account and didnt need to give Mr K a reason. They agreed that Mr K hadnt 
received the best customer service and awarded him £50.
Mr K complained to our service.
One of the investigators looked at the complaint. The investigator asked NatWest to provide 
more information about why it had blocked and closed Mr Ks account. But NatWest said it 
couldnt provide anything more than it had already provided to us. And maintained that it 
hadnt treated Mr K unfairly.
The investigator said although NatWest were entitled to review the account, they hadnt 
provided enough information to this service to be satisfied they had acted fairy in closing 
Mr Ks account. Therefore, he thought NatWest should pay an extra £100 in compensation 
together with the £50 already awarded for the trouble and upset caused by the account 
closure. Our investigator thought that all funds had been returned to Mr K on closure of the 
account.
NatWest agreed with the view. Mr K disagreed he said the amount of compensation didnt 
reflect how he was treated and the difficulties he had gone through. He also said he hadnt 
received the £50 originally awarded.
The investigator confirmed to Mr K that NatWest had paid £50 into Mr Ks account on 6 
October 2022.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like NatWest, are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean they have to monitor their customers accounts and may need to 
review an account at any time. While that is happening, they may need to block or restrict 
any payments.
This is reflected in NatWests terms and conditions. These say NatWest can block an 
account to meet its legal obligations and delay payments if needed to carry out further 
checks. In this case NatWest have said they were following their regulatory obligations when 
they blocked the account. I am satisfied they didnt cause a delay during their review and 
were proactive in their enquiries.
Mr K wants to know the reason why NatWest blocked his account. But NatWest doesnt 
disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their accounts. And its under no 
obligation to tell Mr K the reasons behind the account block, as much as hed like to know. 
So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mr K this information.
NatWest proceeded to give Mr K 60 days notice of its intention to close the account.
NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a complaint. 
NatWest has failed to provide sufficient information about why it blocked Mr Ks account and 
the reasons why it no longer wanted him as a customer. So, in this particular case, because 
of the lack of information, I cant be satisfied that NatWest has treated Mr K fairly when it 
closed his account. Taking this into account, I agree with the investigator that NatWest 
should pay Mr K compensation for the trouble and upset caused by closing his account. 
Even though Mr K was given 60 days notice of closure which allowed him time to open 
another account.
Mr K has suggested that he was £4,000 short when he received the balance of his account 
on closure. Having looked at the information provided I havent seen any evidence of this, so 
Im satisfied Mr K received the full balance of his account on closure.
I have gone on to consider the impact the block and closure had on Mr K. Mr K has said he 
was very embarrassed when his card was declined in the shop. He has also said that this 
was his only account, and he was supporting family members and the block made it very 
difficult to get everyday supplies for his family.
Ive already mentioned that NatWest have legal and regulatory obligations which mean they 
are entitled to review payments and block accounts. NatWest were following these 
obligations when they blocked Mr Ks account. 
I appreciate that this was a difficult time for Mr K, and he found himself in a difficult situation. 
Having said that I havent seen anything to indicate that Mr K suffered an impact over and 
above what would have been suffered by anyone that had their account blocked. As such I 
think the total of £150 is fair compensation. I am satisfied that NatWest have paid Mr K the 
£50 they original awarded to him for failures in customer service, giving him the wrong 
information and telling him to attend the branch. I therefore think NatWest should pay him 
the balance of £100 to compensate him.My final decision
For the reasons stated above I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr K £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused 
by the bank closing his account. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2023.
