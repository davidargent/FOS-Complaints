The complaint
Mr M complains that Lloyds Bank PLC took to long to send him a replacement bank card 
which meant he had to cancel a trip to visit family abroad. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M had access to funds in another Lloyds account that had an active cash card.
I haven't seen any evidence of a delay by Lloyds. After potentially fraudulent 
transactions were investigated it took the step of issuing a new debit card, in line with 
the terms. 
After Mr M contacted Lloyds to explain he hadn't received a replacement card it was 
resent. 
I'm satisfied Lloyds didn't tell Mr M to cancel his plans and that he had other options 
to obtain funds. As Lloyds hasn't made a mistake and I think it's dealt with this 
complaint fairly I'm not telling it to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
