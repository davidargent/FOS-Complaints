K822xcomplaint
Mrs A is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made an error which allowed 
her son to see all the details of her accounts  she held with NatWest.  
background 
NatWest has explained  the issue was down  to human error and it apologised. It paid Mrs A 
£250 in compensation and sent her a bunch of flowers. Mrs A says that £250 wasnt  enough  
given the impact to her family the error  had caused. She was also unhappy  that the money  
was put directly into her account.
One of our adjudicators looked  at the case and he agreed that £250  wasnt  enough so he 
asked NatWest to increase its offer by another £750. This meant that NatWest offered     
Mrs A £1,000 in total in recognition of the trouble and upset  the error had caused  her. 
Mrs A still doesnt think £1,000 is enough  she has said she would accept £5,000. So the 
complaint was passed to me to review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute  that NatWest made an error  here. But what is in dispute is the amount of 
compensation that NatWest should  pay Mrs A. 
I know Mrs A is very unhappy   and I can understand why - so Ive considered the impact  
that this breach has had on Mrs A in terms of the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Having done,  I think the offer of £1,000 in total that NatWest has made  is fair and 
reasonable. I can understand that it was upsetting for Mrs A to have  her account information 
shared with her son but NatWest has admitted the error and has apologised. I know that 
Mrs A thinks  NatWest  hasnt offered enough  but its in-line with what we would generally 
award in these circumstances, so I wont be making any further award. 
Ive noted Mrs As comments about the impact this error has had on her husband and her 
other son, but Ive only looked  at the impact this has had on Mrs A, as shes  the only person 
involved in this complaint.
Therefore I direct  NatWest to pay Mrs A a further  £750. 
 
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to award  Mrs A an 
additional £750 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 November 2019.
