K820x#14complaint
Mrs S complains that Gain Credit  LLC (trading  as Lending Stream) gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford to repay. She asks that it refunds interest.
background
Mrs S took out five instalment  loans with Lending Stream  between  May 2016 and November 
2017. Mrs S says she got into a lot of debt as a result of payday loans. Mrs S says her credit  
score was very poor when she took out the loans.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  He said the checks 
made by Lending  Stream  were sufficient  for loans  1 and 2. Lending Stream  should have 
made further checks before offering loans 3 to 5. But the evidence  suggests that, if it had, it 
would have assessed the loans as affordable.
Mrs S didnt agree. She said the loans werent  affordable and caused her to take out further 
loans. Mrs S said Lending Stream should refund the interest  shes paid on loans 3 to 5.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Mrs S took out five loans with Lending  Stream  as follows:
Loan number
Date of loan Amount of loan Highest monthly 
repaymentDate repaid
1 7 May 2016 £500 £216 20 May 2016
2 2 April 2017 £200 £84 2 June 2017
3 14 May 2017 £710 £369* 2 June 2017
4 13 September 2017 £200 £88 27 October 
2017

*includes repayment for previous loan
When she applied for loan 1 Mrs S told Lending Stream her monthly income  was £2,200.  
She said her monthly expenditure was £1,490. Lending Stream  says it did a credit check 
which didnt suggest  any problems. I think these checks were proportionate and the 
information Lending Stream received suggested  the loan was affordable. 
There was a break of nearly a year before  Mrs S took out loan 2. Mrs S told Lending  Stream  
her monthly income was £2,000.  She said her monthly expenditure was £700,  which  
Lending Stream revised upwards. Lending Stream asked Mrs S to provide her expenditure 
for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, transport, credit costs and other. I think these checks  were  
proportionate and the information Lending Stream received  suggested the loan was 
affordable.
Ref: DRN28933622The information Mrs S gave Lending  Stream when she applied  for loans 3 to 5 also 
suggested the loan repayments  were affordable. 
Lending Stream says it verified Mrs Ss stated income with third party  sources. It says it used 
data about national averages to verify  Mrs Ss stated expenditure and revised it upwards. 
This still resulted  in enough disposable income for her to meet  the loan repayments. Lending 
Stream says the results of its credit  checks were satisfactory. 
Given the break in lending  between  loan 1 and the later loans, the amount of the monthly 
repayments and Mrs Ss stated income  I think the checks  made by Lending Stream were 
proportionate. The information it received suggested the loan repayments  were affordable.
Mrs C provided  her credit report.  This shows she had defaults  recorded in 2013  and had 
taken out loans with other  short term lenders. I dont know  if Lending  Stream  knew this. But if 
it did, it doesnt mean that it couldnt  lend to her  especially  as the defaults were recorded 
several years before she took out the first loan. 
Our adjudicator said that Lending Stream should  have  made  further checks before  offering 
the later loans. I dont  think  it needed to do so. But I note that, after reviewing Mrs Ss 
financial circumstances as evidenced by her bank  statements, our adjudicator said Lending 
Stream would have  assessed the loans  as affordable if it had made further checks.  
Based on the available evidence, I dont think Lending Stream  was wrong to offer Mrs S 
these loans. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 February  2019.
