The complaint
Mr B complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to permanently 
restrict his account without providing an explanation. Mr B is also unhappy as he believes 
PayPal have shared this information with other companies.
What happened
Mr B held a PayPal account, which he used to both buy and sell items. On 29 July 2018, 
PayPal permanently restricted this account, saying Mr B had breached the accounts terms 
and conditions. Mr B was unhappy about this and appealed the decision. But PayPal 
rejected this appeal and the restriction remained in place. Mr B was unhappy about this, so 
he raised a complaint.
Mr B didnt think PayPal had acted fairly when restricting his account. And he didnt think it 
was reasonable for them to do so without explaining why theyd taken this action. Mr B also 
believed PayPal had reported this restriction to other companies, which had seem him lose 
access to certain services and unable to withdraw funds from a gambling account he held Mr 
B was also unhappy that £8.89 of his available balance hadnt been released for a significant 
period of time. So, he wanted to be provided with an explanation, refunded the £8.89 he 
couldnt withdraw and be compensated for the upset hed been caused. He also wanted 
PayPal to remove any reporting of the account restriction.
Mr B says he didnt receive a response to his complaint, so he brought his complaint to us. 
Our service contacting PayPal about this issue, who then provided a response to Mr Bs 
complaint. 
PayPal thought theyd acted fairly, in line with the terms of the account, when restricting Mr 
Bs account permanently. And they thought these terms made it reasonably clear they had 
no obligation to detail the reason why the account was restricted. So, they didnt think theyd 
done anything wrong here. But they recognised an IT system issue has prevented Mr Bs full 
balance being released. So, they credited Mr Bs account by £8.89 to allow him to withdraw 
this, which Mr B did. And they didnt think they needed to do anything more. Mr B remained 
unhappy with this response, so he asked our service to continue with our investigation.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought PayPal acted in 
line with their terms and conditions when permanently restricting the account. And they didnt 
think PayPal were obligated to provide the reason for this, as well as explaining our service 
is also unable to disclose this as PayPal deem this information to be commercially sensitive. 
They also thought PayPal acted fairly by arranging for Mr Bs account to be credited when 
they became aware not all the funds had been realised. And finally, they explained they had 
seen no evidence to suggest PayPal had shared information about Mr Bs account being 
restricted. So, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr B didnt agree with this. He thought PayPal were made aware of the £8.89 not being 
released much before they agreed to credit his account. And he thought PayPal had 
messages to show this, which he was now unable to provide. And Mr B provided 
screenshots of his attempts to withdraw funds from a gambling website, which explained a 
balance needed to be settled with PayPal before he could complete this. So, he thought this 
showed PayPal had reported the account restriction and he explained this was damaging for 
his career. As Mr B didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr B. I understand Mr B used 
his PayPal account to both buy and sell items. So, I appreciate how the permanent 
restriction to his account wouldve made it more difficult for him to do so. And I understand 
why Mr B would be left frustrated as he hasnt received a definitive reason from PayPal as to 
why this was. I also recognise Mr Bs worry that PayPals decision has impacted his dealings 
and reputation with other businesses and because of this, why he would want PayPal to 
remove the limitation to prevent this.
But for me to say PayPal should remove the account limitation, Id need to be satisfied 
PayPal acted unfairly when applying it in the first place. So, Id need to see evidence that 
shows they acted outside of their user agreement when limiting the account. Or, if I think 
they acted within this, that it was unfair for them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think 
thats the case.
Ive seen PayPals user agreement, which explains PayPal may limit a customers account 
immediately, without penalty to them, if they believe a customer has engaged in what they 
believed to be restricted activities.
PayPal have confirmed they are unable to disclose the reason for the account limitation. And 
the user agreement explains We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk 
management or security procedures to you. So, I dont think I can say PayPal have acted 
unfairly, or outside of the agreement, by not detailing their reasoning to Mr B. And theyve 
confirmed this decision is a commercially sensitive decision, so Im also unable to disclose 
the reasoning. But PayPal have provided me with their reasoning, alongside supporting 
evidence, and from this Im unable to say PayPal acted unfairly or disproportionately. So, Im 
unable to say PayPal should remove the limitation on this occasion.
But Im aware Mr B believes this limitation has impacted his dealings with other 
organisations. In particular, his ability to sell items through retailer E and to withdraw funds 
from a gambling website, who Ill refer to as F.
And from what Ive seen, I think its reasonably clear Mr B has had issues with these 
companies, in particular F. But I dont think I can say this is because of anything PayPal 
have done wrong.
PayPal have stated they dont report the limitation of an account to central databases for 
other companies to see. And Ive seen no evidence that shows me otherwise. So, I dont 
think it would be fair for me say what theyve stated is untruthful or incorrect. But even so, 
Ive seen PayPals user agreement, which states under the heading Actions we may take if 
you engage in restricted activities that PayPal may contact third parties and disclose details 
of the restricted activities in the manner set out in our privacy statement. Ive looked at PayPals privacy statement, which provides several reasons as to why they 
may share a customers data. And I think from the two examples Mr B have provided, both 
with retailer E and F, any data shared with these would fall under the terms of the statement. 
So, even though I have no evidence to show PayPal have shared information about the 
limitation, if they had I dont think they wouldve done anything wrong by doing so as I 
believe the decision to place the limitation in the first place was fair. 
Ive also seen that F have stated Mr B is unable to withdraw funds until hes cleared an 
outstanding balance with PayPal. But PayPal have provided me with evidence that shows 
their system records Mr Bs limited account with a balance of £0. So, I dont think I can say 
that PayPal are responsible for Fs decision to prevent withdrawals into the affected bank 
account and this is something Mr B should raise with F directly.
Finally, Ive thought about the £8.89 that wasnt released to Mr B in 2018. PayPal have 
recognised this failure to release was caused by an internal system error. And they say once 
they were made aware of this, they credited Mr Bs account, so he was able to withdraw it, 
which he since has. So, Ive thought about whether I think this fairly resolved the issue. And I 
think it did. 
Mr B has fairly referred to PayPals user agreement, which explains funds in a limited 
account should be released after 180 days. And its not in dispute that this didnt happen on 
this occasion. But PayPal have said this resulted from a system issue which they werent 
aware of. And as soon as they were aware, they took steps to rectify the issue.
Mr B says he messaged PayPal on several occasions through PayPals message centre 
asking for the money to be released. And so, he thinks PayPal purposely delayed this until 
our service became involved. But Mr B has been unable to evidence these messages, as 
they are cleared from PayPals message centre after 90 days. PayPal have confirmed this is 
the case. But PayPal have confirmed they are still able to access messages after this point 
and they theyve been unable to locate any messages from Mr B relating to the £8.89 and 
making them aware he was unable to access this.
So, I have to think about what I think it most likely to have happened, based on the 
information I have available. On one hand, Mr B who is unable to access messages after 90 
days say these messages were sent. But PayPal, who can access these messages, say 
none were sent and so, cant be located. And what I can see is that the account was limited 
in 2018. So, if Mr B was aware of the £8.89 not being released at this time, and that PayPal 
werent responded to his messages, I wouldve expected him to contact our service around 
that time about this. Instead, Mr B didnt contact our service until April 2021. Considering Mr 
Bs unhappiness about the unreleased funds, and how long its taken to be given back to 
him, I wouldve expected Mr B to have taken steps sooner to contact us. 
So, on the balance of probability, I think its most likely that Mr B only realised the issue with 
the funds around the time he contacted our service. And because of this, I think this is when 
PayPal became aware of this issue. I can see they rectified the issue with two weeks of this, 
which I think is within a reasonable amount of time. So, I dont think they need to do anything 
more in relation to this.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mr B was hoping for. And I recognise this leaves him with 
a permanently limited account with PayPal, which he believes will have ramifications on his 
ability to use the services retailer E and F. But I cant say these difficulties have arisen from 
anything PayPal have done wrong and so, I wont be asking PayPal to do anything more on 
this occasion.My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2022.
