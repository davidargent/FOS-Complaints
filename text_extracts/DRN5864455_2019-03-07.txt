Miss T says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss T had four loans with QuickQuid,  as summarised in the table below. Loans 2 and 3 
were topped up, as denoted by the letters alongside  the loan numbering. This means  
QuickQuid provided  Miss T with further funds  during  the course  of the loan agreement.

An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in respect of loans 
2a-4. QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to 
decide. As theres been no further  dispute about loans 1 and 2, my decision  will only be 
about the loans still in dispute  loans 2a-4.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
Ref: DRN58644552In its response to our adjudicator, QuickQuid said:
we are unable to agree  that [Miss T] should not have  been provided with loans 2a - 4 
based on the enhanced  checks performed  prior to approving  each of these loans.  Please 
note that in CashEuroNet UKs initial response  to [the Financial Ombudsman  Service]  we 
provided detailed  information indicating why these loans  were  responsibly lent to [Miss T]. 
I have now attached the entire lending process  including all the checks  that we perform prior 
to lending, the screenshots of customer applications  as well as the sample 
acknowledgement from the contract that customers have to check  when their repayment 
amount is greater than their estimated disposable income.
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  case-specific findings about the 
proportionality of its checks  or the affordability of the loan, nor did it provide any new 
information for me to consider.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic argument directly  and 
through earlier final decisions. So I am not going  to address this point here, though I have  
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Miss Ts complaint and what both parties  have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Miss T borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in 
mind the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC),  I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks:
Ref: DRN58644553the higher  the loan amount,
the lower the consumers income;  or
the longer  the lending relationship.
I understand that when Miss T applied for loans  2 and 3, she told QuickQuid she was 
earning £1,400  a month; this figure increased to £1,524 for loan 4. Ive seen QuickQuid also 
recorded information about Miss Ts declared  expenditure  and this totalled £625 a month.  
Based on what Miss T declared, shed have  disposable  income  of £775-£899 a month.
However, QuickQuid used an estimate  for Miss Ts disposable income (EDI), which  was 
influenced by other  factors  including credit  reference  agency  data. It hasnt  shared  any credit 
reference agency data with us but has provided  the EDI figures  for each loan:
Loan 2 - £470
Loan 3 - £509
Loan 4 - £899
The EDI for Loan  4 appears to be a simple deduction of Miss Ts declared expenditure from 
her declared  income. Loans 2 and 3 have been  subject to further  adjustments beyond a 
simple deduction.  But without seeing the details of what caused  QuickQuid  to revise Miss Ts 
disposable income downwards, its not possible for me to say whether QuickQuid carried  out 
proportionate checks when arriving at the EDI figures above.
As I dont know how QuickQuid arrived at the EDI figures  for loans 2a-3,  Ive considered  
what I think a proportionate  checks wouldve shown, taking into account  information about 
Miss Ts income  and regular expenditure (as declared to QuickQuid), as well as the 
evidence Ive seen  of her short-term debt at the time.
Our adjudicator thought QuickQuid wouldve seen  from proportionate checks  that Miss T had 
around £3,000  worth  of short-term debt when  she applied  for loans 2a/2b. Even if QuickQuid 
wasnt able to establish that Miss T had all of this other outstanding short-term debt (some  of 
it was taken in close  proximity to the QuickQuid loans), I think  its likely  proportionate checks 
wouldve given QuickQuid  enough  information to understand  Miss T had a large amount of 
short-term debt relative to her income  and so wouldve seen that it wasnt likely she could 
take on further debt and repay it sustainably. Loan 3 was taken out only a day after loan 2b 
was repaid and from what Ive seen Miss Ts situation didnt change in that time.  
Loan 3a was Miss Ts sixth advance in just over two months and so QuickQuid ought to 
have been concerned she may not have been  repaying her loans sustainably. I consider it 
wouldve been proportionate for it to ask for some form of proof of income and expenditure 
before approving further loans, particularly  given the frequency with which  Miss T was 
borrowing. I think the same applies for loans  3b and 4, for the same  reasons.
In the absence of any other information,  I think its reasonable to take into account  
information from Miss Ts bank statements to help me decide  what proportionate checks  
wouldve shown QuickQuid.
As our adjudicator set out, at the time of loans  3a-4,  Miss T had short-term debt of over 
£3,000 and was borrowing repeatedly from multiple  lenders.  The sums she was borrowing 
were (often far) in excess of a single months income. Her bank statements also show there 
were a considerable number (and value,  relative to her income)  of gambling  transactions.
Ref: DRN58644554From what  Ive seen, I dont think Miss T couldve taken  on further debt and repaid it 
sustainably at this time.  And I think its likely QuickQuid  wouldve established  this, had it 
carried out proportionate checks.
In summary,  I think proportionate checks wouldve  likely led QuickQuid to the conclusion  that 
loans 2a-4 were not sustainably affordable for Miss T, so Im upholding her complaint about 
them.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 2a-3b
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Miss T paid them until 
the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 2a-4 from Miss Ts credit history
I understand there is still an outstanding  balance  on loan 4. So QuickQuid should remove 
any interest and charges  from that balance and treat any payments made as if they were 
payments towards  the principal. QuickQuid may then offset what it owes Miss T for loans 2a-
3b against the balance of loan 4.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Miss T a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 April 2019.
