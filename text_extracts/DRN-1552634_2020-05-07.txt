The complaint
Mr As complaint is about a payment not being received into his account.
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr A was expecting a large payment into his TSB account from a third party. But it 
didnt arrive as expected.
TSB said in its final response that it hadnt located a returned BACs payment on 19 
February 2019. And as it was the receiving bank it was unable to do anything to 
locate the missing funds. Mr A would need to ask the sender of them to raise a trace. 
The CHAPS payment sent on 20 March 2019 wasnt retuned by TSB to the sender 
and the payment seems to have gone to another bank. 
TSB has made reasonable efforts to locate the receipt but it couldnt do so. And we 
cannot reasonably hold TSB responsible for the funds not being received when Mr A 
expected. 
Taking everything into account, although I recognise Mr As frustration I dont think 
TSB has done anything wrong and its treated him fairly. And I cannot reasonably 
hold it responsible for the delay in Mr A receiving his money or require it to do 
anything more or differently.
 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about TSB Bank plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2020.
