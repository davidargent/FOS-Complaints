In the most recent review  of this case our adjudicator  upheld  Mr Rs complaint about loans 
6  18 and thought these  loans shouldnt have been given. Neither party  responded so, the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN97180732the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Sunny says it carried out an affordability  check before lending Mr R any of his loans  which  
involved checking Mr Rs income  and expenditure and enquiring about his short-term loan 
commitments. However, by the time Mr R was applying for loan 6 I think Sunny shouldve 
realised that Mr R was not managing his finances  well. I say this because  Mr R took out 
several loans in quick succession - at the time of applying  for loan 6 Mr R had taken  out five 
loans within  two months. Although Sunny says it allows customers  to take out multiple loans 
at a time to provide  them  with flexibility, I think taking out such  a large number  of loans so 
quickly, without repaying the loans as quickly suggests that the consumer might be 
struggling financially. And Mr R applied for loan 6 the day after paying  off loan 5, and for 
double the amount. All together this evidence suggests Mr R was having problems 
managing his money and may have  had problems repaying his loans in a sustainable  
manor. And so, a properly  carried out affordability  assessment  was likely to lead a 
responsible lender to conclude that the loan  or any subsequent ones - was not affordable  
for an applicant in that situation. So, I dont think Sunny  shouldve  lent Mr R loan 6 or any 
subsequent loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 9. I say this because:
Ref: DRN97180733At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out eight loans within three months  and still had loans 6, 
7 and 8 outstanding at this point. So Sunny ought to have  realised  it was more likely 
than not Mr R was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £200 and loan 9 was for £350, so it doesnt  look like his 
financial position was improving over time. So, at this point Sunny ought  to have 
known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall  in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 9 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan either  before or within  days  
of settling a previous  one. And a number of the loans  provided after loan 9 are still 
outstanding. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  18 was 
taken out seven months after his first. And the amounts  borrowed were  not 
significantly reducing. Mr R had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
ny debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Mr R borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications on 
his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back  if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A.Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr R towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  it has already  refunded.
B.Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by 
Mr R which  were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr R originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C.Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Mr R as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr R having 
made overpayments  then it should  refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  
Ref: DRN97180734interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny  should  then refund  the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D.If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Mr R. However, if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mr R. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has 
already written-off.
E.Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Rs credit file in 
relation to loans  6 - 8. The overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  
these loans entirely from Mr Rs credit file. Sunny does not have  to remove  any 
outstanding loans from Mr Rs credit file until these have been repaid, but Sunny 
should still remove any adverse  information  recorded about these loans.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 May 2020.
