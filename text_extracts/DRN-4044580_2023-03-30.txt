The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cia SCA restricted his account, and 
subsequently closed it. Hed like an explanation and compensation.
What happened
Mr B held an electronic money account with PayPal. 
In January 2021 PayPal restricted the use of his account, saying they were carrying out a 
review into the account activity. They later wrote to him to say he had violated their 
Acceptable Use Policy, and the restriction would remain permanently.
Mr B complained to PayPal, saying he hadnt breached the terms of his account. But PayPal 
stuck by their decision, referring to the Acceptable Use Policy in their terms. They also said 
the terms allowed them to hold on to any funds for 180 days after the decision to close the 
account.
PayPal later released the funds held back to Mr B in April 2021. 
Unhappy with this answer Mr B referred the complaint to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into what happened but didnt think PayPal needed to do anything 
further. They were satisfied that PayPal had acted within the terms when they carried out a 
payment review of Mr Bs account, and when they subsequently closed it. They accepted it 
would be frustrating for Mr B to not be told precisely why his account had been closed, but 
overall felt PayPal had acted in line with the agreement and were entitled to choose who 
they do business with.
Mr B didnt agree and said no breach of PayPals terms had occurred. As no agreement 
could be reached the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im satisfied PayPal dont need to do anything further.
PayPal have explained that their user agreement allows them to restrict the use of accounts 
when they feel theres been a breach of their Acceptable Use Policy  which can include 
taking part in any of the restricted activities outlined in the terms. Theyre not under specific 
obligation that I am aware of to let their consumers know the reason for doing so. 
In this case PayPal have reviewed the use of Mr Bs account and identified an issue with it. 
Theyve declined to go into further detail, which isnt unreasonable in and of itself. But I can 
see when they wrote to him to let him know they had limited his account, they provided a 
brief outline of their decision and referred him to their terms. So, I think its likely Mr B has 
some understanding of the reason behind PayPals decision.
Likewise, the terms of the account say PayPal can choose to close  or in this case 
permanently restrict  an account when theyre satisfied a breach of the Acceptable Use 
Policy. The investigator has already provided the list of restricted activities, so I dont intend 
to go in to detail about them here. But Ive considered the full list with the activity on Mr Bs 
account and overall, Im satisfied thats it isnt unreasonable for PayPal to restrict and then 
close his account. 
Mr B held a balance on his PayPal account when it was permanently restricted. The terms 
say they can hold on to balances for up to 180 days after an account is closed. In this case 
they released the funds to Mr B in a little under 100 days. Im satisfied he hasnt been unduly 
inconvenienced by any delay in returning his funds.
I appreciate Mr B will likely find this answer unsatisfying and would like to know more. But 
Im satisfied PayPal have followed their own processes and terms of the user agreement 
here. I havent seen anything to suggest the decision PayPal took was unreasonable in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2023.
