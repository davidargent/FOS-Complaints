K820x#14complaint
Miss D says Barclays  Bank UK Plc (Barclays) mis-sold her a Travel pack from its feature 
store in 2013. Shes used a Claims Management  Company (CMC) to make  her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Miss Ds complaint and didnt think  the feature store  pack 
had been mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Ds complaint. 
Ive looked at everything thats been provided  on this complaint. And having done  so, I 
havent seen anything to suggest Miss D was mis-sold her Travel pack. 
I think that Miss D freely  chose  to take the Travel pack, and she couldve used the benefits  
too. So while  Im open  to the possibility Miss D wasnt provided with everything she 
shouldve been,  I havent seen anything  to suggest clearer  information  wouldve changed  her 
decision. And, in these  circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Ds complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 March 2019.
