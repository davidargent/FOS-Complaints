The complaint
Mrs R, representing the Estate of Mr R, complained about National Westminster Bank plc. 
She said that:
- NatWest had kept the original Will and only given her a photocopy, when shed taken 
it in to a branch in December 2017;
- NatWest then repeatedly said it hadnt got the original Will. This meant Mrs R 
couldnt apply for probate because she didnt have the original Will;
- the original Will was returned to her by post in a brown envelope in March 2020 but 
NatWest said it didnt recognise the envelope as coming from them.
What happened
Mr R died in December 2017. A few days later, Mrs R took the death certificate and Mr Rs 
Will into a NatWest branch. The branch staff took the Will to the back office to photocopy. 
They came back and gave Mrs R lots of paperwork. She thought NatWest had everything it 
needed.
Mrs R went into NatWest a number of times to ask why there was such a delay in releasing 
her husbands money. In 2019, she complained about the lack of communication, being 
given incorrect information about her husbands accounts; and delay in releasing the funds. 
In its reply in May 2019, NatWest said that it was sorry it had let her down. Mrs R had said 
she believed NatWest has only required probate because it had merged Mr Rs four 
accounts together. But NatWest said it hadnt merged the accounts, and the decision about 
whether or not it needed probate depended on the total sum, regardless of how many 
accounts there were. NatWest said that, once it received probate and the account closure 
form from Mrs R, it would release the money within 7 to 10 working days. It apologised and 
said it would pay Mrs R £300 and send her flowers.
In December 2019, Mrs R contacted this service. She said that when NatWest asked for 
another copy of the Will, shed realised that when shed gone into the branch in December 
2017, NatWest hadnt given her the original Will back. It had only given her a copy  and she 
needed the original, in order to apply for probate.
Complaints to this service have to be referred to the bank first, so before we could look at it, 
NatWest considered Mrs Rs complaint about the missing Will.  
In March 2020, Mrs R received a brown envelope through the post, which contained the 
missing original Will. NatWest looked at Mrs Rs complaint. It said that its records showed 
that in December 2017, it had sent a certified copy of the Will to its bereavement services 
team, and that was what it had on file. That team had written to Mrs R saying what accounts 
Mr R had held, and had asked her to send probate and an account closure form, so the 
accounts could be closed.
NatWest said the envelope Mrs R had very recently received didnt look like a NatWest 
envelope. It didnt use the banks headed stationery, and the bank also didnt use sticky 
labels for the address. But it said it couldnt confirm that it definitely hadnt been NatWest 
which had returned the Will to Mrs R. NatWest also confirmed that any packaged bank fees 
which might have been charged since Mr Rs death would be refunded. And it said it would 
deal with the closures as a priority, when Mrs R was able to send probate and the closure 
form.
Mrs R remained unhappy and asked this service to look at her complaint.
The investigator said she thought it was unlikely that the Will which arrived in Mrs Rs post in 
March 2020 had come from NatWest. Mrs R asked why NatWest had paid compensation if it 
had done nothing wrong, and the investigator said that the banks letter in May 2019 had 
upheld her complaint about service, but not about keeping the original Will. Mrs R also said 
how upset she was that NatWest had continued to debit fees, including travel insurance 
premiums, after Mr R had died. The investigator sympathised, but explained that NatWests 
systems put a stop on the account when Mr R had died, but its processes were to refund the 
fees whenever the final settlement was made. 
Mrs R remained very unhappy. She said the NatWest had acted in an appalling manner, and 
had been highly insensitive in charging her husbands account for two and a half years after 
hed died. And she said NatWest had lost the original Will, which had held up probate. Mrs R 
said the stamp on the envelope which had brought the original Will had been sent from a 
post office directly opposite the branch. And it had reappeared three or four months after an 
investigator had contacted NatWest about the Will. Mrs R said that shed received a bunch 
of flowers and £150, which didnt compensate for the financial embarrassment shed had to 
go through at this emotional time. Mrs R asked or an ombudsman decision, and her request 
was passed to me in late November 2020.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First and most important, Im sorry to hear of Mrs Rs bereavement. I do know its a very 
difficult time. And I recognise that the fact that it took so long to be able to close Mr Rs 
NatWest accounts will have been very stressful and upsetting for her. 
I recognise that Mrs R has been unhappy with the service from our investigator. Our 
investigator has explained what Mrs R can do if she wishes to complain further about the 
service she has received. It isnt my role to look into that, but specifically to consider her 
complaint against NatWest.  
Mrs R has made a number of complaints to NatWest. The main one is about the original Will, 
which she took into NatWest in December 2017. 
Original Will
NatWests proper procedure is to take a copy, certify it and return the original to the 
customer. NatWest produced a certified copy from December 2017. But I recognise that this 
doesnt necessarily prove that it didnt keep the original Will as well, by mistake. The Will 
was returned in mysterious circumstances in March 2020. Mrs R first complained to NatWest 
about the Will being missing in her complaint to the bank on 17 March 2020. The envelope 
containing the Will reached Mrs R shortly before NatWests complaint response letter dated 
31 March 2020.
Mrs R has said that she didnt have to supply the Will to any other organisation, so it can 
only have been NatWest which held onto it. And shes said the brown envelope was posted from a post office opposite the branch. On the other hand, the Will was returned in a brown 
envelope with a label, rather than on NatWest headed stationery.
I cant say for certain what happened. But Mrs R has assured us that she didnt send the Will 
anywhere else. And shes told us that the postmark was from just opposite the branch. The 
timing of its return is a big coincidence if NatWest didnt keep it. So I consider its quite likely 
that a member of NatWest staff found the Will on file when Ms R complained about it on 17 
March 2020, and posted it in an anonymous envelope. 
The rules which govern this service say that when considering compensation, what I can 
look at is how the customer was affected  and here, the customer is the Estate of Mr R. So 
although I fully recognise that Mrs R is distressed by what happened, Im afraid its not open 
to me to order compensation for distress to be paid to Mrs R, who is the Executor not the 
customer. The law says that an estate isnt a person, so cant feel distress. Thats not to say 
I under-estimate Mrs Rs upset. Its just that the law means I cant award compensation for 
her personally.
I have, however, also looked at whether there was a financial loss to Mr Rs estate, resulting 
from the Will being missing.
Ive looked carefully at Mrs Rs complaints to NatWest on behalf of the estate, and the first 
time she complained that the original Will was missing was in March 2020. So its not open 
to me to say that there was a financial loss as a result, because it turned up not long 
afterwards. As NatWest was the only organisation to which Mrs R sent the Will, its likely that 
shed have contacted NatWest earlier, if shed needed it to send off for probate. So its not 
open to me to award compensation for financial loss to the estate.
Account charges
I can quite see that Mrs R would have found it shocking and upsetting that NatWest 
continued to debit charges  particularly including travel insurance premiums  from Mr Rs 
account, even though shed provided his death certificate promptly in December 2017. 
Ive seen from the statements that these premiums were refunded, once NatWest received 
probate and was able to close Mr Rs accounts. So there was no financial loss to Mr Rs 
estate. And this service cant order a bank to change its computer systems and procedures  
thats the role of the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
General service 
I recognise that NatWest didnt provide good customer service to Mrs R, at a difficult time. 
NatWest has acknowledged that and paid Mrs R compensation, which Ive considered.
There was a difference of evidence about how much was paid. Mrs R told us she was paid 
£150 and sent flowers, and NatWests letter to Mrs R on 21 May 2019 said it was paying her 
£300 and sending flowers. So I asked NatWest for evidence of how much it paid Mrs R. It 
sent evidence that it paid £300 on 21 May 2019, labelled Compensation on the account 
statement. 
Ive looked at the elements of Mrs Rs complaint to NatWest. These included the length of 
time before the accounts were closed. The reason for this was because NatWest required 
probate. When someone dies, financial institutions set their own levels at which they ask for 
a grant of probate. With NatWest, that level was £25,000, and the total balances in Mr Rs 
accounts was higher than that. What matters is the total, not the amount in any one 
individual account. I havent seen any evidence that NatWest did merge Mr Rs accounts, but whether it did or not, it didnt make any difference to needing probate. It was the total that 
mattered, and Mr Rs account balances totalled more than £25,000. 
Mrs R says she needed the original Will, which she believed NatWest had kept, before she 
could get probate. Its true that she would have needed this. But the first record of Mrs R 
complaining to NatWest that theyd kept this, and saying she couldnt apply for probate, was 
on 17 March 2020. As Ive set out above, the Will turned up mysteriously very soon after 
this. So even if a NatWest branch had accidentally kept the Will, theres no evidence that this 
caused a significant delay to probate.
NatWest has compensated Mrs R for the impact its service had here, but as Ive explained, 
Im only able to compensate the Estate of Mr R for financial loss, not for distress, so it 
wouldnt be open to me to increase this payment to Mrs R.
My final decision
My final decision is that although I recognise that Mrs R has had a very difficult time, and Im 
sympathetic to that, I dont uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank plc for 
the reasons above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr R 
to accept or reject my decision before 30 December 2020.
