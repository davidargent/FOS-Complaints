K820x#14complaint
Mr G says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr G had four loans with Mr Lender. Ive summarised  some  of the details of these in the 
table below.
Loan  no. Amount Start date End date
1 £300 20/05/2011 15/08/2011
2 £250 22/07/2016 14/10/2016
3 £400 17/10/2016 19/12/2016
4 £700 19/12/2016 n/a
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint but didnt recommend it be upheld. Mr G 
didnt agree with this, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
Ive noted Mr Lender offered to reduce the balance of loan 4 by removing interest and 
charges and also apply a refund of interest for loan 3 to the outstanding  balance  effectively 
making loans 3 and 4 interest free. Mr Lender  confirmed the offer was still available when it 
sent us its file for this complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
I hope Mr G wont take it as a discourtesy that this decision is relatively short.  But I think  
Mr Lenders original offer resolves any complaint he may have about the affordability of 
loans 3 and 4  as it set out, the offer to refund or remove interest  effectively makes  the 
loans interest free. So Mr G wont have  suffered  a loss in relation to those loans if he 
accepts Mr Lenders offer. I wont therefore say anything further about these loans.
This just leaves loans  1 and 2. Both of these loans were relatively small in relation to Mr Gs 
declared income and they were separated by a gap of almost  five years. In the 
circumstances, I think  it was reasonable  for Mr Lender to rely on a statement of income  and 
expenditure from Mr G before lending. This means I dont think  proportionate  checks 
wouldve suggested the loans were unaffordable. And there was nothing about  the pattern of 
lending which suggested Mr G was reliant  on Mr Lenders loans at this time.
Ref: DRN26450222In the circumstances, I am unable to uphold Mr Gs complaint. As Mr Lenders original offer 
is still open Mr G may wish reconsider  whether to accept  it.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  PDL Finance  Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 September  2019.
