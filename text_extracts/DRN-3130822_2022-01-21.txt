The complaint
C, a limited company, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) put a stop 
on its business account meaning it was unable to pay staff, invoices, or direct debits. 
Mr G is one of Cs directors and brings the complaint on the companys behalf. 
What happened
C has held an account with NatWest for many years. 
NatWest undertook a review of all small and medium businesses that held accounts with it.  
It wrote to C to request information from the business as part of the review. Mr G says the 
letter did say there may be restrictions made on the account but did not give a date as to 
when those restrictions would take place and to what extent the restrictions might be.  Mr G 
says the letter looked like a sales flyer.  
NatWest sent the first request for information by letter in August 2019. It sent a further eight 
letters prior to the account being restricted in September 2020. 
NatWest didnt receive the information requested from C and so restricted its bank account. 
Mr G says this meant the business was not able to pay invoices, pay staff wages, or pay into 
staff pensions. Mr G says as a result the reputation of the business has been affected. 
After C provided the information to NatWest the restrictions were removed. Mr G was not 
happy with the way NatWest handled the business review and so made a complaint 
regarding the service.  
In its response NatWest said it sent C a letter asking for certain information as part of its 
account review process. NatWest said the information was requested in order to comply with 
its obligations under law and C failed to provide this. NatWest said if it does not receive the 
information it is entitled to restrict the account which is what it did. It said letters were sent to 
C explaining the process and providing enough time so if the company had any questions it 
could contact the bank. NatWest also said restricting the account was a last resort and 
entirely in line with the business review process. Mr G was not happy with the response 
received and so referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator looked into things and concluded that NatWest didnt need to take any 
action. He said NatWest had written to C on a number of occasions detailing what was 
required for the business review, the reasons for the review, and a deadline for providing the 
information. The investigator felt NatWest had acted reasonably and in line with 
expectations. Mr G didnt agree and so this matter has been referred to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am sorry to hear about the impact of what happened when the account was restricted and I 
understand Mr Gs feelings here, especially given C is a long-time customer of NatWest. 
From the information provided to me I can see that NatWest made a number of requests to 
C for information starting in August 2019 until September 2020 when the restrictions were 
applied. 
NatWest explained it required certain information about C as part of its regulatory 
obligations. I dont think its unfair that NatWest would need the information it requested. 
NatWest sent C nine letters from August 2019 to September 2020 when the restrictions were 
placed on the account. I have seen these letters and I am satisfied the letters are clear in 
what it are asking for, when it require the information by, and what will happen if the 
information is not received by the deadline. Each letter has a deadline by which the 
information is required by. 
Mr G has said the letters look like flyers and the business receives a lot of junk mail Even 
taking this into account, the letter is from NatWest and has its the logo in the top corner. The 
letter also states Why were sending you this letter with an explanation of why the letter has 
been sent. And Do I need to do anything where it says Yes. Please provide the required 
information or contact the helpline as detailed below I am satisfied the correspondence is 
provides enough information as to what it is asking for, why and by what date.  
In each of the letters NatWest says it may restrict Cs account if the information it has asked 
for isnt provided. I understand what restricting the account meant for C and for Mr G. But as 
referred to earlier, NatWest have legal and regulatory requirements which it must meet, and I 
think it has explained what the potential consequence to C is if the information it has asked 
for is not received. 
Mr G says NatWest should have contacted C by email or telephone in order to request the 
information required, especially since the consequences of not providing the information was 
so serious. I acknowledge Mr Gs strength of feeling about this. However, NatWest were 
carrying out a review of all small and medium businesses that held accounts with it and so I 
dont think it would be reasonable for it to make telephone calls to each of those companies. 
In the terms and conditions of the account NatWest say one of the ways it will communicate 
with C is by letter and so its fair it corresponds by letter and expects that letters would be 
received and actioned. 
Having considered the information I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong here. I 
dont doubt the impact restricting the account has had on the business. However, I am of the 
view NatWest provided C with ample opportunity to provide the information needed before it 
restricted the account.
I can see Mr G is very frustrated the bank put a stop on the account and I can understand 
why. I appreciate the disruption it will have caused. But my role here is to determine this 
complaint based on what, in my opinion, is fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
My final decision is I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
