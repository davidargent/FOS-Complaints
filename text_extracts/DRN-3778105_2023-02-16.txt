The complaint
Mr D complains that he is owed £1,012.04 by Ulster Bank Ltd (Ulster).
What happened
Mr D had two loans from Ulster. In January 2019, the balances were £3,697.30 (Loan A); 
and £3,902.10 (Loan B). He ran into financial difficulty and in April 2019, took advice from a 
debt management charity. Reduced monthly payments of £36.75 were agreed by Ulster and 
these commenced in June 2019. Interest on both loans was zero. Formal demand was made 
and the loans transferred to a debt collection agency to manage.
In November 2020, Mr D made an offer of £4,505.78 as full and final settlement against the 
then debt of £6,502.77. Ulster rejected that as his income and expenditure showed he had 
surplus income and so could afford to make repayments. 
Credits were received into both loan accounts until October 2020, by when the balances 
were £3,128.51 (loan A) and £3,351.67 (loan B). No payments were made until 9 April 2021 
when two credits for £2,118.53 and £2,245.18 were paid into Loan B. So  loan B went into 
credit with a balance of £1,012.04. The balance on loan A was then still £3,128.51.
In August 2022, Mr D called Ulster. He was told that the credit balance on loan B was to be 
transferred to loan A, and that was done.  So, then the outstanding balance remained on 
loan A - £2,116.47. Ulster told Mr D he was liable to repay the balance.
Mr D complained. He said it was intended to split the two credits between the two loan 
accounts, and not allocate them to one loan. He said it wasnt fair to transfer the credit 
balance on one loan to the other. He said Ulster only did that because he called them. He 
hadnt given agreement for that transfer to be made. He says the credit balance of £1,012.04 
was rightfully his and it should be paid to him. He said he had a lot of family commitments to 
pay for and needed the money.
Ulster said theyd accepted reduced payments from Mr D in June 2019.  After the credits 
received into loan B on 9 April 2021, loan B was left in credit by £1,012.04 and the 
outstanding balance on loan A was still £3,128.51. Ulster said they had a right of set off 
between the two loans  which said that any credit balance held on an account in Mr Ds 
name may be used to reduce the outstanding balance on another account. Ulster said they 
didnt need Mr Ds permission to do that.
Ulster said that on the call on 4 August 2021, that was explained to Mr D and he was asked 
to come to an arrangement to repay the outstanding balance of £2,116.47 on loan A.
Mr D didnt agree and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Ulster acted 
reasonably. Mr Ds debts were amalgamated under Ulsters right of set off. He said that 
meant Mr D still had a remaining debt which had to be repaid. Interest remained frozen.
Mr D didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen Mr Ds comments to our investigator  so let me say at the outset that we are not a 
consumer group  we dont take sides. We listen to both sides of a complaint, take evidence 
from both parties, and then decide on a fair and reasonable outcome  for both parties. We 
are an independent body.
Mr D says he needs the credit balance that resulted (£1,012.04) for his family living 
expenses, and that he intended that the two credits would be split between the two loan 
accounts. So  Ive considered what he has said in his complaint.
After monthly payments had been paid into the two loans between June 2019 and October 
2020, the two loan balances £3,128.51 (loan A) and £3,351.67 (loan B) (as of 2 October 
2020). I can see that from the loan account statements.
Ulster did have a right of set off. This was shown in Ulsters terms and conditions which I 
looked at. These say:  Using money in your account to repay money you owe us: If youve 
borrowed money from us (for example, through a loan, credit card or overdraft) and the 
money or the repayments are overdue for payment, we may take money from your account 
to repay some or all of the money you owe us (including any fees or interest). This is called 
set off . Its also normal banking practice among all banks to have those clauses and to do 
the same  so its not particular to Ulster. So, they were entitled to treat the two loans as one 
and look at the total debt outstanding. The combined debt was £6,480.18 in October 2020  
and after the credits had been received it reduced to £2,116.47 on loan A.
I listened to the call on 4 August 2021 and in it, Ulsters call handler went through the same 
figures as Ive set out; and said that between the two loans, Mr D owed £2,116.47 after the 
receipt of the credits. So  Ulster were consistent in what they told Mr D.
Mr D says that Ulster only combined the loan accounts because he called them  on 4 
August 2021. I agree the call handler said it looked odd that one loan account had gone into 
credit, and then said the two loans should be amalgamated. And then went ahead and did 
that  so it does seem that it was spotted on the call. But that doesnt mean to say that Mr D 
was entitled to take the credit balance of £1,012.04 for the reasons Ive set out. And I think 
its reasonable to say that Ulster wouldve spotted that the loan account was in credit at 
some stage anyway  without Mr Ds call. 
Mr D argues that if he had been allowed to split the credits of £2,118.53 and £2,245.18; then 
he couldve benefitted in some way  by allowing him to retain a credit balance of £1,012.04. 
But I dont see how that couldve possibly been the case, as even if the credits had been 
split, he would still have owed money on both loans  lets say the balances wouldve been 
£1,009.98 (£3,128.51 less £2,118.53) on loan A; and £1,106.49 (£3,351.67 less £2,245.18) 
on loan B  a total of £2,116.47. So, I dont see how there wouldve been a credit balance 
resulting if the credits had been split as he suggests was his intention. 
What this means is that Mr D still owed Ulster £2,116.47 and Id encourage him to come to 
an arrangement with the debt collection agency to repay the balance.My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2023.
