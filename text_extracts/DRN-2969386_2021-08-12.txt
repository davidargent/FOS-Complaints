The complaint
Mr B complains that the loans he had from Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream)
were unaffordable.  
What happened
Mr B had six loans from Lending Stream between March 2019 and July 2019 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Monthly 
Repayment*Due Repaid
1 29 Mar 2019 £600 169d £231.85 13 Sep 2019 5 Jul 2019
2 27 Apr 2019 £540 175d £406.41 11 Oct 2019 14 Apr 2021
3 26 May 2019 £210 174d £534.30 8 Nov 2019 14 Apr 2021
4 3 Jun 2019 £80 173d £566.15 22 Nov 2019 14 Apr 2021
5 15 Jun 2019 £70 175d £594.40 29 Nov 2019 14 Apr 2021
6 6 Jul 2019 £640 175d £621.20 20 Dec 2019 Outstanding
* Including overlapping loans
Mr B says Lending Stream allowed him to borrow more money after his initial loan, even
though he was already in financial hardship. He says he had multiple loans with other
lenders, some of which had been defaulted. Mr B adds that Lending Stream didnt check
whether the repayments were affordable.
Lending Stream says it asked Mr B about his employment and income, as well as his regular
outgoings. It says it sanity-checked these figures with statistics from independent sources 
and revised them upwards if required. Lending Stream says it also carried out a credit check
to understand Mr Bs existing credit commitments and found all six loans were affordable to
him. Lending Stream offered to set up an affordable payment arrangement for the
outstanding balance.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He found that by
loan 4, Mr B was showing signs that he was struggling to repay his existing loans. Our
adjudicator recommended that interest and charges should be refunded on loans 4 to 6, and
that adverse information about the loans should be removed from Mr Bs credit file.
Lending Stream accepted the adjudicators view and offered to remove all entries about
loans 4 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file. It asked Mr B to contact it if he wished to set up a
repayment plan for the remaining balance.
Mr B responded to say, in summary, that he did not accept this offer as he said he was
already in financial difficulties when he started borrowing from Lending Stream.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision to Mr B, and to Lending Stream, on 12 July 2021. I 
summarise my findings here:
I was satisfied that Lending Streams checks went far enough for loans 1 and 2. 
There was nothing in the available information to indicate that it should have carried 
out further checks and, based upon Mr Bs declared disposable income, the 
repayments were affordable to him;
For loan 3, I didnt find Lending Streams checks went far enough because:
oThe maximum monthly repayment was now almost 20% of Mr Bs declared 
income;
oLending Stream needed to ensure Mr B could sustainably make repayments 
on all three loans for almost six months;
oMr B had incurred a late payment fee on loan 1;
oIf Mr Bs disposable income was as much as the £2,100 hed declared, then 
hes unlikely to have needed these additional high-cost loans;
oAt the time of his loan 3 application, Mr B declared he spent £75 per month 
on credit expenditure  this was a significant reduction from the £525 hed 
declared at the time of his first two loans and did not take into account his 
existing Lending Stream loans.
I had a look at Mr Bs bank statements and credit file and found that, in addition to 
the two existing Lending Stream loans, Mr B owed money to at least six other high-
cost lenders when he applied for loan 3. I was satisfied, therefore, that if Lending 
Stream had carried out proportionate checks it was likely to have found it was 
irresponsible to have approved further lending to Mr B;
Mr B still had all his previous loans outstanding at the time of his applications for 
loans 4 and 5, and his scheduled repayments continued to increase. Again, I found 
that Lending Streams checks didnt go far enough and, as Mr Bs financial 
circumstances were largely unchanged from loan 3, I was satisfied loans 4 and 5 
were not affordable to him;
Finally, I considered Lending Streams overall pattern of lending by loan 6 and found 
it should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful because:
oMr B applied for loan 6 just one day after hed repaid loan 1 and it was for a 
higher amount;
oLoan 6 was Mr Bs sixth in under four months, so Lending Stream ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr B was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
oMr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream 
and he already had four other loans outstanding. Mr B had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an 
extended period.
So, in summary, my provisional decision was to uphold Mr Bs complaint about loans 3 to 6.
Mr B had no further points to add.
Lending Stream responded to say, in summary, that it would settle in line with the provisional decision and would remove all entries for loans 3 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr B, nor Lending Stream, submitted any additional information, I see no reason 
to depart from my provisional decision. I acknowledge that Lending Stream has offered to 
remove all entries about loans 3 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending 
Stream) should:
A. Add up the repayments made by Mr B towards interest and fees on loans 3 to 5;
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled;
C. Remove all interest and fees from the balance on loan 6, and treat repayments 
made by Mr B as repayments of the principal on the loan;
D. If reworking Mr Bs loan 6 account as Ive directed results in Mr B effectively having 
made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Lending Stream should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, 
from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement* along 
with the refund calculated (A+B) for loans 3-5;
E. If reworking Mr Bs loan 6 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
Lending Stream can use the total refund for loans 3 to 5 (after the deduction of tax) 
to offset this. Any surplus then needs to be refunded to Mr B. But if there is still an 
outstanding capital balance then I remind Lending Stream that it should take a 
sympathetic view when seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr  B;
F.Lending Stream should remove all entries about loans 3 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to deduct tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream should give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2021.
