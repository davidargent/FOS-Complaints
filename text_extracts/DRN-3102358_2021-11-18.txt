The complaint
Ms A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) will not allow her to repay 
the outstanding balance on her credit account monthly. 
What happened
In August 2020 a cheque for £2,342.58 was paid into Ms As main PayPal account. On 11 
January 2021 the full amount of the cheque was debited from Ms As main account leaving it 
with a negative balance. PayPal said they determined that the cheque was paid into Ms As 
account in error. 
Ms A said she only became aware of the cheque when she received an email in February 
2021, from PayPal, advising that her negative account balance had to be repaid.
Ms A says that since finding out about her negative account balance, shes tried to arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with PayPal. However, Ms A says that PayPal have told her 
that she needs to repay the amount in full or in weekly instalments. Ms A said that she cant 
afford to repay the cheque amount in that way, however can only afford to do so by paying in 
monthly instalments. 
Ms A said that shed been in contact with PayPal in excess of twenty times, in trying to 
resolve the matter and has been brought to tears with how shed been treated by them. 
On 9 February 2021 PayPal provided their response to Ms As complaint. In their response 
they advised that they believed their actions had resolved the complaint. 
On 12 February 2021 Ms A brought her complaint to us. One of our investigators looked into 
Ms As concerns and felt that the complaint should be upheld. Our investigator didnt think 
that PayPal had acted fairly as they believed a monthly payment plan should have been put 
in place for Ms A. Our investigator recommended that PayPal complete an income and 
expenditure and arrange an affordable monthly repayment plan for her. Our investigator also 
recommended that PayPal pay Ms A £150 compensation for the trouble and upset caused to 
her. 
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view as they believed that Ms A refused to deal with 
their collections department to resolve the issue. PayPal asked that the complaint is referred 
to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal confirmed to us that in August 2020 they received a cheque, by post, for £2,342.58 
which was credited to Ms As account. They also confirmed that in January 2021 they were 
told by the cheque issuer that the cheque was meant for a different account. PayPal said the 
funds were subsequently transferred to Ms As credit account. The account statements 
provided by PayPal show the funds were credited to Ms As credit account on 19 August 
2020. 
PayPal said that the credit and subsequent transfer had been completed based on the 
information provided by the cheque issuer. So, Im persuaded that PayPal made the initial 
error of paying the cheque into Ms As account. PayPal have said they were following 
instructions; however, I find that Ms A had been inconvenienced as a result.  
Ms A says she didnt become aware of the cheque until February 2021 when she received 
the notification of her negative account balance. Ms A explained that she doesnt usually 
check her credit account transactions and relies on her monthly minimum payment to 
maintain the account. I think what Ms A has said is plausible, and so Im satisfied that she 
wasnt aware of the cheque until in February 2021.
Given that Ms A received the funds in error, Im satisfied that she should pay it back. 
However, I think its reasonable that Ms A should be afforded the opportunity to repay it 
monthly, as she was doing with her credit account. 
Ms A has said that shes happy to repay the funds but would prefer to arrange an affordable 
monthly repayment plan. PayPal have also said in their case notes that theyre happy to 
accommodate monthly repayments. So, I think PayPal should establish and agree with Ms A 
an affordable monthly repayment plan to repay the negative balance. 
PayPal should also amend Ms As credit file to ensure there is no adverse credit information 
relating to the negative balance on her main account. I think this is fair in the circumstances 
given that the funds had been credited in error.
Ms A said she contacted PayPal around twenty times to try and understand what had 
happened, and to arrange to repay the funds. The system notes provided by PayPal show 
that Ms A had been in contact with them on a number of occasions. Ms A has said that on 
more than one occasion she was left in tears after speaking with PayPal and was told by 
them that the police would become involved. Ms A said PayPal werent very helpful when 
she contacted them, and she didnt feel they listened to her. However, PayPal have said to 
us that Ms A refused to deal with their collections department to resolve the matter. 
I havent heard any call recordings between Ms A and PayPal or seen any call transcripts, so 
I cant say exactly how Ms A had been treated during her interaction with PayPal. However, 
Im persuaded by what Ms A has said, and from the information provided, that she 
experienced some distress and inconvenience as result of the error. 
Given that PayPals error has caused Ms A some distress and inconvenience, I think she 
should be compensated to reflect this. And I think £150 as recommended by our investigator 
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
Having thought about everything above, along with what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances I uphold this complaint and instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to:
agree an affordable repayment plan with Ms A, of which monthly repayments should 
be considered if this is Ms As preference 
pay Ms A £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused
remove any adverse credit information that may have been recorded on Ms As credit file as a result of the funds being paid in and removed from Ms As main 
account 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2021.
