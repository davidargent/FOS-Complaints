The complaint
Mr H says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, (PDL), irresponsibly lent to him. 
What happened
This complaint is about 15 short term loans PDL provided to Mr H between 
July 2012 and October 2016. Loans 1 to 11 were repayable by one monthly repayment and 
Loans 12 to 15 were repayable by six monthly repayments. All the loans have been repaid. 
Mr Hs borrowing history is as follows:

PDL, in its final response letter, said that it could see that Mr H had only repaid 
Loan 6 shortly before his application for Loan 7. There had also been a slight change in 
Mr Hs credit report. So, it offered a refund of £578.50 on three loans.
Mr H rejected this offer.
Our adjudicators first view upheld Mr Hs complaint in part and said Loans 4 to 9 shouldnt 
have been given. 
PDL responded to say that it had omitted to include Loan 8 (in the above schedule) in its 
submission to this service.
Our adjudicator then issued a second view to include Loan 8. He said that Loans 4 to 10 
shouldnt have been given. He noted that there were breaks in lending between Loans 10 
and 11 and Loans 11 and 12. He said that the breaks were enough for PDL to consider that 
Mr H wasnt reliant on the loans and that Loans 11 and 12 could respectively be considered 
as the start of new lending relationships. Our adjudicator also said that by Loan 4 Mr Hs 
overall pattern of borrowing suggested that he was persistently reliant on short term loans 
and his loans from Loan 4 to Loan 10 were unsustainable. 
PDL responded to say that it disagreed but it offered to refund the fees and interest paid on 
Loans 6 to 10, pay 8% interest on the refunds and remove adverse information on those 
loans from Mr Hs credit file in line with the adjudicators recommendations.
Mr H rejected PDLs offer.
The adjudicator asked PDL why it didnt uphold Loans 4 and 5.
PDL responded to say that the loan amount for Loan 4 had dropped and the number of 
rollovers prior to Loan 4 were in line with regulation at the time. It also said that although the 
loan amount for Loan 5 had increased, it had obtained information about Mr Hs expenses 
before Loan 5 and there had been no late payments on Loan 4.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
I note that our adjudicator didnt think Loans 1 to 3 and 11 to 15 should be upheld.  Mr H 
hasnt disagreed, so I havent considered these loans any further in this decision. But I have 
considered these loans when thinking about the overall borrowing relationship between Mr H 
and PDL. 
I can see that PDL has offered to settle Loans 6 to 10. So, I wont investigate Loans 6 to 10 
below but will refer to the redress offered by PDL in my award. 
PDL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr H could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that PDL 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable 
for a consumer. These factors include:  the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
  the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable). 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. I think that it is important for me to start by 
saying that PDL was required to establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. 
PDL did some checks before it lent Loans 4 and 5 to Mr H. It asked him for details of his 
income and before Loan 5 it also asked about his expenditure. And it checked his credit file 
before agreeing the loans. Ive seen a brief summary of those checks which showed a credit 
score, that Mr H hadnt been made bankrupt and he wasnt in an individual voluntary 
arrangement in the previous three years. I dont think that the results of these checks should 
have caused additional concerns to PDL.
Ive not seen Mr Hs own credit report.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of PDLs lending history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which PDL should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, PDL should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point 
was reached by Loan 4.
By the time of Loan 4, Mr H had been borrowing from PDL for almost eleven months with 
barely any gaps. PDL was aware that Mr H hadnt kept to the payment schedules in his loan 
agreements for Loans 2 and 3. He repaid Loan 2 a month late and Loan 3 was repaid three 
months late. I think the late payments more likely than not indicated that Mr H had underlying 
financial difficulties and that he wasnt managing to repay his loans sustainably. 
Although Loan 4 was for a lower amount than his previous loan, it was the third time that 
Mr H had taken a new loan from PDL very shortly after repaying his previous loan. I think it 
was more likely than not that Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying 
his previous loan was leaving in his finances. And the loan amount was still higher than his 
first two loans. So, he wasnt making any inroads into the amount hed owed PDL on his first 
loan. I also dont think the loan amount for Loan 4 was anywhere near low enough to give PDL any confidence that Mr Hs finances had stabilised. This was shown by Mr H borrowing 
Loan 5 on the date he repaid Loan 4 and his new loan amount had more than doubled.
I think PDL ought to have known that it was unlikely that Mr H was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need and that it was likely 
Mr H was dependent on its lending. 
I think that Mr H lost out because PDL continued to provide borrowing from Loan 4 onwards. 
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
continue to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. The cumulative length of time he'd been borrowing from PDL was likely to have had 
negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans. And the fact that the loans were repaid doesnt mean that 
they were repaid sustainably, or without causing Mr H undue difficulty. 
So, I dont think PDL should have given Mr H Loans 4 and 5, and I think it needs to pay Mr H 
some compensation relating to these loans in addition to the compensation it has already 
offered for Loans 6 to 10. So PDL should put things right as shown below. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this complaint 
I order PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, to take the steps shown below.
1. Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr H on Loans 4 to 10;
2. Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*. 
3. The length of Mr Hs borrowing relationship with PDL means any information recorded 
about Loans 4 to 10 is adverse. So, all entries about Loans 4 to 10 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL to take off tax from this interest. PDL must give Mr H 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 August 2020.
