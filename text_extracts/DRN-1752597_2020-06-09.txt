The complaint
Mr R complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit, wasn't of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ford Credit, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr R - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will depend on a number of factors;
a new car was supplied to Mr R in January 2019 and he complained about some 
issues with it in April 2019 (including issues with the brakes, axle noise and the lane 
guidance system) so the dealer investigated the issues but no faults were found;
Mr R complained to Ford Credit and it offered to have the car inspected by another 
manufacturer's dealer and arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent 
expert in August 2019;
the independent expert's report said that the settings on the lane guidance system 
had been adjusted and were now to Mr R's liking but that the expert wasn't able to 
identify any fault relating to the concerns that he'd raised (but it did identify three fault 
codes that it said should be investigated);
Mr R says that the lane guidance system still isn't working properly, that there's an 
issue with the air-conditioning and that the sunroof is leaking - he also says that the 
value of the car that he part-exchanged for this car wasn't correct so the agreement 
was mis-sold to him;
I can understand Mr R's frustration about the issues that he's had with the car and his 
disappointment that the lane guidance system isn't working as he expected it to - but 
the car was inspected by the dealer and an independent expert and no faults were 
found relating to the issues about which he'd complained, Ford Credit offered to have 
the car checked by another manufacturer's dealer and the dealer has said that it will 
investigate and repair any issues with the air conditioning and sunroof;
Mr R's complaint about the value of the car that he part-exchanged wasn't included in 
the complaint that he made to Ford Credit or to this service - so I'm unable to 
consider it as part of this complaint (but the amount of credit provided under the hire purchase agreement - which he electronically signed - is consistent with the price of 
the car shown on the invoice) - if Mr R wants to complain that the agreement was 
mis-sold to him he should complain about that to Ford Credit and then, if he's not 
satisfied with its response, he may be able to make another complaint to this service;
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that the car was faulty when 
it was supplied to Mr R or that it wasn't of satisfactory quality at that time and I 
consider that Ford Credit's response to his complaint has been fair and reasonable; 
and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for Mr R to reject 
the car or for me to require Ford Credit to take any action in response to his 
complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr R's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
