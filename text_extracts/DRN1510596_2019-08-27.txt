K820x#14complaint
Mrs M says PDL Finance  Limited trading as Mr Lender irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about three loans Mr Lender provided to Mrs M between March  2015 and 
April 2015. Mrs Ms borrowing history  is as follows:
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold any part of Mrs Ms complaint and thought the loans were  
correctly lent. Mrs M disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Before lending any of the loans, Mr Lender  says it searched Mrs Ms credit file and asked 
her for monthly income and living costs  including credit commitments.
From what  I can see, Mrs M declared her income  as £822 throughout the lending and her 
disposable income varied from £618  to £743.
Mrs M was due to repay loan 1 in six instalments and the highest repayment  was around 
£177. This was the first loan and the checks Mr Lender carried  out didnt suggest  Mrs M 
couldnt afford to repay this loan. Mrs M had sufficient disposable income to sustainably  
repay this loan and I dont  think Mr Lender was wrong to lend this loan. 
Mrs M repaid loan 1 early  and within two weeks borrowed loan 2. Loan 2 was for less than 
her previous  loan and Mrs M was due to make  one repayment of £112.80 towards this loan. 
Mrs M declared  her disposable income  as £662 and this suggests  she could afford this loan.loan

Ref: DRN15105962Mr Lenders credit search at the time of loans 1 and 2 didnt show  that Mrs M had other  short 
term loans but by loan 3, its search showed that Mrs M had one short term loan. Loan 3 was 
for the same amount  as loan 1 and the highest repayment was around  £177. Mrs Ms 
disposable income of £618 suggests  that she could afford this loan.
Ive thought about whether Mr Lender should  have taken its checks further  for loan 3 given 
that it found Mrs M had a short  term loan and she was taking out this loan within  a few days 
of repaying loan 2. But I dont think that should necessarily have caused it to take its checks  
further here. I say this because Mrs Ms declared outgoings were £204  and given  that Mrs M 
had repaid both her previous loans  without any obvious difficulties, it wasnt  unreasonable  
for Mr Lender to rely on the information Mrs M provided when making  its lending  decision.
I accept that Mrs Ms actual situation was different to what Mr Lender was aware  of as I can 
see that she was borrowing  from several other lenders but this wasnt something  Mr Lender 
was aware of or would  have found  from proportionate checks.
I appreciate that Mrs M got into financial difficulties with repaying  loan 3 and had to set up a 
repayment plan for this loan so Ill understand why shell be disappointed  with my findings 
but I hope my explanations help her understand why Ive reached these conclusions.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I do not uphold Mrs Ms complaint or make  an award against 
PDL Finance  Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 September  2019.
