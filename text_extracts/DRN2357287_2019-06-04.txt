QuickQuid initially objected to us looking into Miss Ms complaint. It said shed complained 
too late. Our adjudicators have explained to QuickQuid why we think that we can consider 
Miss Ms complaint. It says it that whilst it appreciates the points which were made it still 
believes that it did enough checks when it provided  the loans to Miss M. So it doesnt agree 
it lent to her irresponsibly.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ms complaint about irresponsible  lending - in part. She thought 
that loans 3 and 4 shouldnt have been given.  As QuickQuid disagrees the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.    
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out enough checks to make ensure Miss M 
could afford  to repay the loans. These checks could take into account a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Miss Ms income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was affordable for the consumer. These  factors 
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN23572872the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unaffordable).
When QuickQuid provided  the loans to Miss M it asked her about  her income  but not her 
expenses. She declared a monthly  income  of £1,415. Given  that the amount being  borrowed 
for Loan 1 I think QuickQuid probably  did enough  when  it provided that loan to Miss M. But 
she kept coming back for higher  and higher amounts very soon after repaying  the previous 
loan. So I dont think QuickQuid did enough from Loan 2 onwards to check  Miss M would be 
able to afford the loans.
Having said that the amount Miss M borrowed for Loan 2 was not so significantly increased 
 that I can safely say she couldnt  afford to repay £250 on 28 August 2009  as agreed.
So I'm not upholding Miss Ms complaint about Loans 1 and 2.
But I dont think QuickQuid acted  responsibly when it provided Loans 3 and 4. Miss M took 
Loan 3, six weeks  after her first loan,  for well over three times the amount of Loan  1 (and 
over double Loan 2). And she took it only three  days after repaying  Loan 2. This borrowing 
pattern suggested  she was becoming reliant  on short term loans. But additionally, she was 
due to repay £562.50 on 28 September.  This represented a significant proportion of her 
declared income. 
On 24 September  2009 Miss M extended Loan  3  in other words she wasnt in a position to 
repay it on 28 September as agreed. She repaid  it on 28 October  and borrowed again  on 
2 November - five days later. This time (Loan 4), she borrowed the highest  amount yet - 
£650. She was due to repay  over £812 on 27 November: this was almost 60% of her income 
and left her very little from which to meet her rent and other normal monthly  expenses. So 
I'm satisfied that these two loans werent  affordable for Miss M and that it was irresponsible  
of QuickQuid to advance them to her.
So Im also upholding  Miss Ms complaint about Loans 3 and 4 and QuickQuid  should  put 
things right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid  needs  to do
Our adjudicator recommended  that QuickQuid refund all the interest and charges Miss M 
paid on Loans  3 and 4. That is more  than we would usually require a business to do where  
there is an outstanding  balance  - as there is on Loan 4. No payments have been made since 
March 2010. 
I have noted Miss Ms comments  about  having had a default recorded  on her credit  file for a 
number of years on a loan which shouldnt have  been advanced. I've thought  about  her point 
but I'm also mindful that she did have the benefit  of the £650 capital which  was lent. And 
even if I considered all the payments she made as reducing the capital owed, she didnt 
repay all of it  there remains an outstanding capital balance. 
Ref: DRN23572873So having  thought about everything, I require QuickQuid to do the following:
A.refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on Loan 3
B.pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
C.remove all interest and charges applied to Loan  4 and treat all payments made by 
Miss M as though  they were made  towards the capital. This will leave a capital 
balance outstanding 
D.QuickQuid may use the sum calculated in A and B to offset the capital balance  
assessed in C. It should then pay the remaining sum to Miss M  
E.remove all adverse  information relating to Loans  3 and 4 (if there is any) from 
Miss Ms credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give Miss M a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  provided, Im partially  upholding Miss Ms complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
should put things right as Ive explained above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 July 2019.
