The complaint
Mr P complains he was charged a late fee and interest by Creation Financial Services 
Limited (Creation).
What happened
Mr P had a Creation credit card. He paid the balance off each month. He received paperless 
statements and was advised by email when they were issued and available to be viewed 
online. The March 2020 statement showed a balance of £368 debit, with the minimum 
payment of £5 due by 13 April 2020. On 17 April 2020 he got a text message from Creation 
saying a payment hadnt been made. He paid £1360 into the account on 18 April 2020. He 
was charged a late fee of £12 and interest of £15.15.
Mr P said he didnt get the email in March 2020 advising him of his March statement. He 
only got an email if a balance was due  and so he didnt do anything. So, it wasnt fair that 
he was charged the fee and interest. And he said  why would he have paid in £1360 
instead of £368 if hed seen the statement.
Creation said they emailed Mr P on 23 March 2020 and advised him his statement could be 
viewed in his online account. Payment was due by 13 April 2020. As it wasnt received until 
18 April 2020, a late fee was charged, and interest debited to the account.
Our investigator said that Creation told us Mr P viewed his online statement on 2 April 2020 
 before the payment due date of 13 April 2020. Creations terms and conditions state that 
interest was payable if the full balance wasnt paid by the due date, and late fees would also 
be paid if the minimum payment wasnt received on time. He sent to Mr P screenshots of the 
data provided by Creation which showed that Mr P viewed the statement on 2 April 2020. Mr 
P disputed this data and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory (as some of it is here) I 
must base my decision on the balance of probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not 
to have happened in all of the circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
I can see that Mr P feels very strongly about this. Hed opted for paperless statements  and 
he only received an email from Creation when hed used the card and therefore when a 
balance was due. Hes certain he didnt get an email in March 2020  and therefore didnt 
pay anything. The transactions which went through in his card were unexpected ones. He 
said that he paid £1360 immediately he got a text from Creation saying his payment was 
overdue  and this shows he couldnt have been aware of the statement as it was a lot more 
than was needed. 
We showed Mr P the data we obtained from Creation  which shows that he viewed his 
statement on 2 April 2020. He disputed this as it also showed that the statements for certain 
other months were either not viewed at all or were viewed several months later  so Mr P 
said the data must be flawed. Ive looked at the statements for the months where this 
happened. They show very few transactions  August 2019 had one transaction of £408  
and was paid off on 31 August 2019; September 2019 had one transaction of £11000  and 
this was paid off in October 2019; January 2020 had two transactions totalling £1041.70  
and £1095.20 was paid on 5 February 2020. This payment included a transaction of £53.50 
made on 2 February 2020. So, its possible that in these months - Mr P knew what his 
purchases had been with the card and paid the account off by reference to them  rather 
than looking at the statements online. So, this tends to show that Creations data showing 
when statements were viewed is valid.
Creation say they emailed a notification on 23 March 2020 that the statement was available 
to view online. And it said that payment was due by 13 April 2020. Theyve shown us 
evidence  that Mr P viewed the online March 2020 statement  on 2 April 2020. So, 
Creation say - he was aware of the amount to be paid and by when. Creations terms and 
conditions say If we agree, you may opt to receive an electronic Statement which you may 
view on-line and for which an electronic notification shall be sent to you each month by e-
mail. Where you opt for an electronic Statement you may revert at any time to a paper 
Statement.  Even though Mr P disputes this, I think this is important evidence.
Looking at the month in question - there were only three transactions for £1344 made in 
March 2020  and its possible that Mr P paid in £1360 knowing that was the case. I note 
that Mr P says he was unaware of these transactions  but he must have been as this 
amount was paid in on 18 April 2020 - ahead of the statement being issued on 23 April 2020. 
But that would explain why more was paid into the account than was needed to pay off the 
March 2020 statement.
I know Mr P will be disappointed by this, but on the balance of the evidence, and having 
looked at what both sides have said I do not uphold this complaint. So, I wont be asking 
Creation to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2021.
