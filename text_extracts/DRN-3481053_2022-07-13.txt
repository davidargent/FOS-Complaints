On the information we have now from Miss S, Loans 1 to 5 have been determined as being 
outside of our jurisdiction.
Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought that loans 9 to 12 were ones where she 
felt that the pattern of lending had become harmful to Miss S. 
Mutual disagreed and sent many submissions as to why it considered that was the case  all
of which I reviewed. I issued a provisional decision on 29 June 2022. Miss S has not 
responded. Mutual agreed with it. In the next part of this decision I have duplicated that 
provisional decision in smaller type to differentiate it. That forms part of this final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional decision dated 29 June 2022 
Mutual has had other decisions from the Financial Ombudsman which detail our approach to 
complaints of this nature and what we think about the rules and regulations that surround the sale of 
this type of credit. So Mutual should be aware of our approach to these issues. And our general 
approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice  are on our website. So, I dont intend to go into detail about those here. But a 
brief summary is below.
I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as does the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within its identified high cost credit cohort. And 
while I note Mutuals loans have longer terms than, for example, a payday loan, that does not make it 
a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these products can 
be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on this point. I have 
considered these issues alongside everything else in making my decision.
Mutual needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different things, such as how much 
was being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mutual should fairly and reasonably have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan repayments to 
a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also suggestive of 
the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may have come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow 
this is the case.
The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and the customer should 
be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Miss S has not responded to the adjudicators assessment, and so it seems she is satisfied with our 
adjudicators outcome and therefore I take it from that, the disputed loans are 9 to 12. Those are the 
ones I have reviewed. If any additional evidence is sent to me then its open to me to review them all 
again before coming to a final determination.
Having reviewed the complaint then I am planning not to uphold Miss S complaint. I am not satisfied 
that there is any evidence the relatively modest repayments each week were such that Miss S found 
them harmful or that they were unsustainable.
And although we have nothing from Miss S about her financial situation for the years covered by the 
Mutual lending, I have a credit search obtained by Mutual around the time she applied for loan 10  it 
was dated 5 December 2018. That shows Miss S had very little overall debt, and no information about 
which Mutual would have had any cause to be concerned. Most of what is listed in that credit search report were the Mutual loans, or utility accounts or telecommunication accounts. Her overall debt was 
£1,201 and her payment record was very good.
Miss S had given Mutuals agent her income and expenditure details for each application and they 
show that she would have been able to afford the repayments, even where sometimes she was 
paying for more than one loan. And in the absence of any financial analysis or details from Miss S 
then I have had to rely on what she told Mutual at the time of the applications. They show affordability.
However, I do think that by the time Miss S had been using the Mutual loans for several years, then it 
ought to have carried out some additional checks. And Id say that applied around loan 5 as Miss S 
asked for £500 at that point and had been a customer for two years. There had been a small gap in 
the lending relationship around that time but not a long enough one in my view for it to have broken 
the loan chain. However, with nothing from Miss S to demonstrate to me what those additional checks 
may have shown Mutual then, on current evidence, I can take it no further.
But for loans 10 and 11 I have a fairly good idea as to what Miss S credit commitment situation was 
like. I refer to what I have said about the credit search report dated  December 2018 which was 
around the time loans 10 and 11 were approved.
By the time Miss S was applying for loan 12, I can see that would have been her third open loan with 
Mutual and another reason for Mutual to have carried out further checks before approving loan 12. 
But still I do not consider that we have enough from Miss S to conclude that she was unable to afford 
it. Or that the additional weekly payments were doing harm. On current evidence I am planning not to 
uphold Miss S complaint.
How have both parties responded to my provisional decision? 
We have heard nothing from Miss S representative or Miss S. 
We have heard from Mutual and it has nothing further to add. 
So, I see no reason to depart from the provisional findings I made in my earlier decision. 
Neither party has sent any additional evidence or submissions. Those findings are repeated 
here and I do not uphold Miss S complaint 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 August 2022.
