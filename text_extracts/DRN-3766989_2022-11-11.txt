The complaint
This complaint is brought by Mr E on behalf A, a limited company, for which he is the 
director. 
Mr E complains ClearBank Limited closed As account only shortly after it was offered to 
him. He says ClearBank should deregister A from Companies House and ensure he bears 
no financial or other liability. He also wants compensation.
What happened
Mr E holds a sole trader account with a firm for which ClearBank is responsible. For ease of 
reference I will refer to ClearBank only from now on. In 2021 he received an email from 
ClearBank which offered help to set up as a limited company and the opportunity to open an 
account for that company.
Mr E took up the offer and made an application, but he says he wasnt told what the 
implications of becoming a director of a limited company were. ClearBank paid the 
incorporation fee and A was set up on Companies House with Mr E as its director.
ClearBank sent Mr E a debit card for As account but before the account was up and running 
it was closed. Mr E complained and wanted to know why, but ClearBank refused to tell him. 
Mr E told ClearBank that they should remove A from Companies House. ClearBank said 
they couldnt do this, as only Mr E had the authority to provide this instruction to Companies 
House.
Mr E brought the complaint to our service. During this time ClearBank offered to carry out a 
further check which might result in them being able to provide A with an account. Mr E 
refused. He no longer wants to be a director or be responsible for a limited company. He 
says he continues to run his business through his account as a sole trader.
Our investigator decided not to uphold Mr Es complaint. They found ClearBank could not 
dissolve A at Companies House  only Mr E could as As director. ClearBank acknowledged 
they ought to have taken further action before deciding to close As account and offered to 
now see if an account could be provided to A subject to further checks. But Mr E refused 
their offer. ClearBank also didnt need to tell Mr E why As account was closed.
Mr E rejected the outcome the investigator reached. He asked for a final decision from an 
ombudsman, so his complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before I issue my findings I must clarify that my final decision on this complaint only 
concerns the closure of As account, whether ClearBank is responsible for dissolving A at 
Companies House, and should they pay A compensation. It does not concern the offer which 
was made to Mr E as a sole trader before A was incorporated.
Our service cannot consider every complaint which is brought to us. Unlike a court of law our 
powers and jurisdiction are limited. The Dispute Resolution Rules (DISP) set out most of our 
services powers, and under them I can only consider alleged losses which arise from the 
qualifying relationship the relevant eligible complainant has or had with ClearBank.
When A was set up, this created a separate legal person to Mr E. A holds the relevant 
qualifying relationship under DISP as it held the account in its name, with Mr E acting on its 
behalf. This means A is the eligible complainant in relation to a complaint about its account 
being closed, and the alleged losses that arose from this. Mr E wasnt the actual account 
holder for As account, so he does not qualify as an eligible complainant, and I cannot 
consider losses he experienced that A did not.
Mr E has complained about the offer ClearBank made to him as a sole trader. I have 
considered this matter under a different final decision which relates to his own customer 
relationship as an account holder with ClearBank.
Ive decided not to uphold As complaint. Ill explain why.
ClearBank have broad legal and regulatory responsibilities to meet when providing accounts. 
Those obligations are ongoing and can broadly be summarized as a responsibility to know 
and verify its customer and to prevent and detect financial crime.
ClearBank acknowledge they ought to have followed a different procedure before deciding to 
close As account. They offered to reconsider whether they could provide A with an account, 
subject to carrying out further checks, but Mr E refused their offer. He says he doesnt want 
to operate his business as a limited company, and he has continued to operate in the way he 
did as a sole trader. So, I dont require ClearBank to make good on its offer in these 
circumstances.
I understand why Mr E wants to know what originally prompted ClearBank to close As 
account. But that information is commercially sensitive, and ClearBank are not obliged to 
reveal this information, so I am not directing them to. 
Mr E feels strongly that ClearBank should remove A from Companies House. But ClearBank 
has been clear that they cannot do this. Companies House can only act on the instruction of 
the person legally entitled to make decisions for a limited company. That person is only Mr E 
as the director of A and not ClearBank. So, I am not directing ClearBank to do something 
they cannot actually do.
Mr E may want compensation for the frustration and upset that dissolving his limited 
company may cause him. But I can only award compensation to A as the eligible 
complainant. A, as a limited company, cannot experience frustration or upset. So, I am not 
awarding it losses because of how Mr E feels.
Mr E refuses to contact Companies House to dissolve A. That is respectfully his choice, and 
ultimately he is responsible for A as its director. He is not prevented from contacting 
Companies House, and he has been told Companies House cannot act on ClearBanks 
instruction - so if he now incurs financial losses or liabilities by his inaction, Im satisfied 
those losses are not for ClearBank to bear.My final decision
Ive decided not to uphold As complaint for the reasons I have given.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2022.
