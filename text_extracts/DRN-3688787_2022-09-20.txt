The complaint
Mr and Mrs P have complained that the broker One Call Insurance Services Limited (OCISL) 
incorrectly auto renewed their home insurance policy and wrongly charged a premium.
What happened
Mr and Mrs P bought a home insurance policy through the broker OCISL in August 2020. 
Under the terms and conditions of the policy they bought, OCISL said it would arrange the 
automatic renewal of the policy to ensure continual cover in time for the renewal date of 4 
September 2021. 
OCISL arranged for Mr and Mrs Ps policy to renew and collected the premium due on behalf 
of the insurer. On 7 September 2021 Mr and Mrs P contacted OCISL to say they hadnt 
wanted the policy to renew. 
OCISL said it would cancel the policy on behalf of the insurer. It said Mr and Mrs P would 
need to pay for the days it was insured at £9.85 along with a non-refundable set up fee of 
£35.99, totalling £45.84. As Mr and Mrs P had paid a yearly premium of £149.59, this meant 
OCISL arranged a refund of the balance of £103.75. This took place in September 2021.
However, at the same time Mr and Mrs P contacted their credit card company to dispute the 
payment of £149.59. The dispute settled in Mr and Mrs Ps favour. So OCISL said Mr and 
Mrs P owed it £149.59. 
Mr and Mrs P complained to OCISL. It said it didnt receive the chargeback amount to their 
credit card. 
In June 2022 OCISL didnt uphold their complaint. It provided a screenshot to show it had 
lost the dispute regarding the chargeback amount of £149.59. It said this happened in 
January 2022. So it asked Mr and Mrs P to provide a copy of their credit card statement for 
January 2022 transactions to demonstrate the amount hadnt been received by them. But 
OCISL said Mr and Mrs P provided copy statements for February and March 2022. So 
OCISL said it would reconsider the issue once it received a copy statement for January 
2022. 
OCISL said as the amount of £149.59 was outstanding, it passed the debt to a debt recovery 
agent and a fee of £25 was added to the amount Mr and Mrs P owed. 
OCISL said it would waive the £25 debt fee. The revised balance it said Mr and Mrs P owed 
was £113.60. This was £149.59 minus the set-up fee of £35.99. So OCISL didnt take into 
account the £9.85 it originally said Mr and Mrs P owed on cancellation for the days they 
were insured. 
Mr and Mrs P remained unhappy and asked us to look at their complaint. 
Our Investigator obtained a copy of Mr and Mrs Ps credit card statements from September 
2021 to April 2022. 
These showed the original payment of £149.59 on 1 September 2022, the refund of £103.75 
by OCISL on 9 September 2021 and the disputed payment as a credit to Mr and Mrs P of 
£149.59 on 10 September 2021. On 23 October 2021 Mr and Mrs Ps card statement shows 
the payment was deducted again for £149.59 as the amount was in dispute. On the same 
day, the statement showed the original balance of £45.84 was credited.
So as things showed on Mr And Mrs Ps credit card statements, it hadnt received any further 
credit in relation to the disputed amount taken for a second time on 23 October 2021. 
Our Investigator asked OCISL to provide evidence to show the disputed amount had been 
credited back to the credit card company from OCISL - as the statements showed Mr and 
Mrs P had effectively paid OCISL £103.75; being the difference between the credited 
amount of £45.84 and £149.59. 
OCISL provided a screenshot which it says shows the sum of £149.59 was claimed back by 
Mr and Mrs Ps credit card provider on 28 February 2022. 
Our Investigator could see that OCISL had notified Mr and Mrs P in good time of its intention 
to renew the policy. So she didnt think it had acted unreasonably here. But she thought it 
wasnt fair for OCISL to chase Mr and Mrs P for an amount their statements showed it hadnt 
received back from OCISL. She thought this was something OCISL needed to take up with 
the credit card provider. The Investigator obtained screenshots from the credit card provider 
which showed no record of it receiving a chargeback sum of £149.59 to coincide with 
OCISLs screenshot of the transaction of 28 February 2022. 
As the evidence showed Mr and Mrs P hadnt received the benefit of the chargeback 
payment from OCISL, the Investigator recommended this complaint should be upheld. She 
recommended OCISL carried out further investigations with the credit card provider to 
establish the whereabouts of the funds. If in future it can show Mr and Mrs P received the 
funds, it can look to recover this amount from them. But as things stood, she recommended 
OCISL stop looking to recover the amount from Mr and Mrs P.
OCISL didnt agree. It said it has shown the amount was deducted from OCISLs account by 
the credit card provider . So OCISL says its for Mr and Mrs P to raise a dispute with them. 
In September 2022 OCISL told us that it had asked Mr P to provide a copy of his credit card 
statement for January 2022 as this is the date the transaction was lost. But he provided 
statements for February and March 2022. However, OCISL maintain that Mr and Mrs P owe 
a balance following the credit of £149.59 on 28 February 2022. 
So OCISL wants an ombudsman to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this case, both the credit card provider and OCISL have provided their evidence by way of 
screenshots to support their accounts. OCISL says it provided a payment to the credit card 
provider on 28 February 2022 for £149.59 as a chargeback payment. 
The credit card provider has provided evidence to show no payment has been received or 
applied to Mr and Mrs Ps account. Given that previous disputed payments reached Mr and 
Mrs Ps account, it seems something has gone wrong with a payment which OCISL say was 
returned to the card provider after leaving their account on 28 February 2022. 
Ultimately Mr and Mrs P have provided sufficient evidence to show that they have not 
benefitted from this amount. It isnt showing on their credit card statements to correspond 
with the amount and date provided by OCISL. 
So as things stand, I dont think its reasonable for OCISL to pursue Mr and Mrs P for a sum 
there is no evidence it received from OCISL. I think this is a matter for OCISL to investigate further and liaise with the credit card provider. I dont think its reasonable for OCISL to 
pursue Mr and Mrs P directly for this sum - until such time as it can show they have received 
the benefit of it. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
require One Call Insurance Services Limited to stop pursuing Mr and Mrs P for the balance it 
says they owe under the cancelled home buildings insurance policy - as the evidence up to 
this point shows Mr and Mrs P havent been the beneficiary of a credit payment from OCISL. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 18 October 2022.
