The complaint
Mr M complains that Northern Bank Limited, trading as Danske Bank, wont refund to him 
the payment that he made for an overseas passport application. 
What happened
Mr M used his Danske Bank debit card to pay Â£69.78 for an online overseas passport 
application in December 2020. He contacted Danske Bank in January 2021 to dispute the 
payment as he said that hed been unable to contact anyone at the passport office to 
authorise a refund.
Danske Bank requested supporting information from Mr M to progress his request for a 
refund in February 2021 and it advised him in March 2021 that his application for a refund 
couldnt be progressed as no confirmation had been received that the application had been 
cancelled. Mr M requested a call-back to discuss the dispute but Danske Bank says that it 
made a number of attempts to call Mr M but he didnt answer so his dispute was closed.
Mr M complained to Danske Bank and then complained to this service. He says that hed 
complained to Danske Bank but didnt get a response. Danske Bank sent a response to his 
complaint by e-mail in June 2021 in which it apologised that Mr M didnt receive a call-back 
but said that his dispute couldnt be progressed through the chargeback scheme as his case 
didnt meet the criteria for a chargeback. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that 
chargebacks are voluntary and Danske Bank decided not to proceed with Mr Ms request for 
a chargeback because there was no evidence to show that the passport office had cancelled 
his application. She was satisfied that Danske Bank had acted fairly so she said that she 
wouldnt be asking it to take any further action.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
passport office was closed due to restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and he 
couldn't do anything so he expected Danske Bank to do more to help him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made; 
Mr M contacted Danske Bank in January 2021 to dispute a payment that hed made 
and he said that hed been unable to contact anyone at the passport office to 
authorise a refund;
Danske Bank asked him to provide further information to support his claim but Mr M 
didnt provide the required information;
Mr M requested a call-back in March 2021 to discuss the dispute but Danske Bank 
says that it made a number of attempts to call him but he didnt answer so his dispute 
was closed;
Mr M then complained to Danske Bank and he then also complained to this service;
Danske Bank sent a response to his complaint by e-mail in June 2021 in which it 
apologised that Mr M didnt receive a call-back but said that his dispute couldnt be 
progressed through the chargeback scheme as his case didnt meet the criteria for a 
chargeback  it said that it could see from the passport offices website that it was 
open and was handling applications received prior to April 2021 and planned to 
process all applications within 6-8 weeks  it also said that phone lines were open 
and the website had a webchat function and that Mr M should refer any queries 
about his refund to the passport office;
I can understand Mr Ms frustration that his passport application wasnt processed as 
quickly as he would have liked and that he had difficulties contacting the passport 
office but Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to show that he was 
entitled to a refund in these circumstances so I dont consider that Danske Bank 
acted incorrectly by not making a chargeback claim and closing his dispute;
Danske Bank says that it issued its final response letter to Mr M by e-mail in June 
2021 using the e-mail address that it held in its records  and it has noted that hes 
used a different e-mail address more recently  and it also says that it informed him 
of the outcome of his complaint by phone earlier that month;
I consider that Danske Bank has acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr M 
about the payment that he disputed; and
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes experienced, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable for me to require Danske Bank to refund to him the payment 
that he made for the passport application, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
