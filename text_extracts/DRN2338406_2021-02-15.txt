K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Toyota Financial Services (UK) PLC wasnt of satisfactory quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr B under a hire purchase agreement  with Toyota 
Financial Services that he signed in March  2019;
there were some issues with the alloy wheels when the car was delivered to Mr B 
and the dealer agreed to cover the cost of a repair  but Mr B says that he hasnt 
been reimbursed  for the cost of replacing them and Ive seen no evidence  to show  
that the dealer has paid any money to him for the alloy wheels;
Mr B then had the car inspected by a manufacturers dealer and it said that the front 
brake pads were the incorrect size for the car and that new front brake pads and 
discs were required which  would  cost £279  and it identified other faults with the car 
that were a creaking rear axle, the engine cam-carrier  leaking oil and a hole in the 
exhaust catalyst  and it said that those issues would be dealt with under the 
manufacturer's warranty  it also said that there was an outstanding recall;
Mr B complained to Toyota Financial Services about the issues with the car but it 
said in July 2019 that it didnt agree that the car was of unsatisfactory quality at the 
point of sale as it had passed  an MOT test at that time;
Mr B then complained  to this service and provided further evidence  about a noise 
that had been identified  when the car was inspected by the manufacturers dealer but 
had only recently been  diagnosed as being caused  by the radiator;
our investigator thought that proven faults  with the car showed that it was of 
unsatisfactory quality  when it was supplied to Mr B so he recommended that Toyota 
Financial Services should: refund Mr B for the cost of replacing the alloy wheels and 
front brake discs  and pads and repairing the radiator; and that it should pay him £400 
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience that hed been caused;
Mr B says that he should  be able to reject the car because of the faults with it but 
Toyota Financial Services says that Mr B has had fair use of the car, he arranged for 
the car to be inspected by a manufacturers dealer without its knowledge so it was 
unable to review  the faults or have  them inspected, the concerns raised  are wear and 
tear items and the cars mileage is quite high;
Toyota Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible  for ensuring  
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr B - whether or not it was 
of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number  of factors,  including the 
age and mileage  of the car and the price that was paid for it;
Ref: DRN23384062satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr B in March 2019  was three and a half years  old years  
old, had been  driven for 25,000 miles and had a price of £9,995 - he arranged for it to 
be inspected by a manufacturers dealer the following month  at which  time some 
issues were identified  but it said that the issues, other than the brakes, would  be 
dealt with under the cars warranty;
Mr B says that a noise  issue identified at that time has been diagnosed as being 
caused by the radiator  and that the manufacturers dealer also said that there  was an 
outstanding recall for the car;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there were issues  with the car when it was 
supplied to Mr B, including with the brakes and radiator,  so the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality at that time  but Mr B was able to use the car and in July 2019  its 
mileage was 30,026,  in June 2020  it was 40,614 and the investigator says that its 
mileage was more than 45,000 in November 2020  so Mr B has been able to drive  
the car for 20,000  miles in about  twenty months and Im not persuaded that it would 
be fair or reasonable  in these circumstances for him to be able to reject the car;
Mr B has paid for the alloy wheels and front brake discs and pads to be replaced and 
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Toyota  Financial  Services  to reimburse 
him for those costs that he incurred (but hell need to provide  it with receipts for those 
costs);
I also find that it would be fair and reasonable for Toyota Financial Services to 
reimburse him for the cost of repairs to the cars  radiators (but hell need  to provide it 
with a receipt for that cost); and
I consider that these  events will have  caused  distress and inconvenience for Mr B 
and I find that it would also be fair and reasonable for Toyota Financial Services to 
pay him £400 to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience   but Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Toyota Financial 
Services to reimburse  Mr B for any other  costs,  to refund  to him any monthly  
payments that hes made under the agreement or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and I order Toyota Financial Services  
(UK) PLC to:
1.Reimburse Mr B for the costs of replacing  the cars alloy wheels and front brake discs 
and pads.
2.Reimburse Mr B for the cost of the repairs to the cars radiator.
3.Pay £400 to Mr B to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience  that hes 
been caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2021.
