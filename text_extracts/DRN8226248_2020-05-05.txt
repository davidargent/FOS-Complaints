K821x#15Complaint
Mr F (by way of a representative)  has complained about the loans he took out with Elevate 
Credit International  Limited trading as Sunny. Mr F says Sunny failed to identify that he had 
become dependent on payday  loans and had become stuck  in a cycle  of borrowing to repay 
previous loans. 
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  3 April 2020. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold the complaint. I invited both 
parties to let me have any further comments and evidence.  Mr F told us he accepted the 
findings of the provisional decision and didnt have anything further  to add. Sunny didnt 
respond. 
My findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr F accepted the provisional decision  and Sunny didnt respond with any further 
comments or evidence it wanted  me to consider, I see no reason to depart  from the findings  
that I outlined  in my provisional decision. 
So, in summary,  I think Sunny didnt make an error by providing the running credit  facility as 
well as all the instalments loan to Mr F. Ive explained below what Sunny needs to do to put 
things right. 
putting things right  what I currently  think Sunny  needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr F paid on loan 1-6 and loan 8
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
I understand  that Sunny wrote off the outstanding balances for loans 7, 9 and 10. So for 
these loans  Sunny should rework  these  loans so Mr F only has to repay the principal 
borrowed and it should treat any repayments made  by Mr F as if it went towards the 
principal balance.  
If and when  Mr F had repaid enough  to repay the principal, then any overpayment 
should be refunded to Mr F. To this overpayment 8% simple  a year interest should be 
added from the date of the overpayment came due to the date of settlement*;
If however, after doing  the above,  there remained an outstanding principal balance  on 
any of the loans Sunny if it wishes can off set any written off principal  sum from the 
refund due on loans 1-6 and 8.
Ref: DRN82262482remove any negative  information from Mr Fs credit file about  loans 1  5
the number of loans  taken from 6 onwards means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6-10 should be removed from Mr Fs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr F as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.

Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny made an error when  it provided Mr Fs running credit facility (loan 
1). But from the way he used it, our adjudicator thought Sunny should  have seen Mr F was showing 
signs that he was struggling to repay his loans and halted any further borrowing  from 24 October  
2014 onwards. By loan 6, our adjudicator thought that Mr Fs pattern of lending shouldve showed  
Sunny that these loans were no longer sustainable.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  but made an alternative offer. Sunny offered to uphold  
Mr Fs complaint about his running credit facility (loan 1) from 24 October  2014 until the facility closed 
in January 2015, along  with loans  8, 9 and 10. 
Mr F rejected Sunnys offer and asked for an ombudsman to consider the complaint.  As no agreement 
could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach to complaints about  short-term 
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.
Having thought about the above, as well as the evidence available to me, Ive provisionally
decided to partly uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks in order to reasonably  conclude whether 
Mr F could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN82262484These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts, and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. Certain factors might  point to the 
fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting  that it could be more difficult to meet  a higher 
repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during which a 
customer has been  given  loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.  Ive carefully considered all of the arguments,  
evidence and information provided in this context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
Sunny has agreed  with our adjudicator about loans  8, 9 and 10 and has made an offer in-line with 
our adjudicators opinion. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about  
these later loans. So, I wont be making a decision about this lending.  But as they were part of the 
borrowing relationship Mr F had with Sunny,  I will take them into account  when considering his 
overall borrowing history.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Fs running credit facility from the start as he thought Sunnys  checks  
were proportionate. But whilst Mr Fs facility  was running, our adjudicator  thought  Sunny should have 
been aware  that Mr F was returning for a new loan shortly after repaying one and that Mr F was 
showing signs  that he was struggling to repay it. So he upheld all drawdowns and loans from 24 
October 2014. 
To start with, Mr F was given a facility  with a £1,000 credit limit. There  was an expectation that hed 
repay what he borrowed plus the interest due within  a period of five months. Had Mr F drawn  down 
the full £1,000  limit at the start, he was due to repay five monthly instalments  of around £264.96.
Sunny has showed us it enquired  about Mr Fs monthly income and it also used information from 
Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). And it was satisfied  based on what  it saw that Mr F would be in a 
position to be able to afford his facility.
But Sunny was required to establish whether Mr F could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. The loan 
payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication Mr F could sustainably make his 
repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
In Mr Fs case, I dont think the information Sunny gathered suggested his facility was affordable. 
Sunny has shown us that Mr Fs declared  his monthly income to be £800.  This meant, in my opinion, 
Mr F was expected  to use a significant portion  of his income in order to make the repayments he was 
committed to making. 
In addition to this, the results of Sunnys credit check showed he had an outstanding  short term loan 
with another lender at the time of his application of £313. There was also information  from the credit 
check suggesting Mr F had a history of taking out short term loans  taking nine loans within  the 
previous six months of his application.
Ref: DRN82262485So, the £313  repayment to another  lender along with his monthly repayment of £264.96 for his 
running credit facility wouldve left Mr F with a little over £230 to cover all of his remaining  living costs. 
In these circumstances, I dont think it was reasonable  for Sunny to believe Mr Fs running credit 
facility could  be repaid in a sustainable manner. So Im upholding Mr Fs complaint about his facility 
from the start.
Mr F then went  on to hold his facility for around 13 months, whilst requesting 15 drawdowns during 
this time.  Our understanding  is that Sunny withdrew  its running credit product at the end of December 
2014. And instead it started providing  instalment loans. 
Whilst Mr F was unable to continue using his facility, I can see he was provided with instalment  loans 
from February 2015. But due to the way Mr F used his facility, and the fact that his circumstances 
hadnt significantly changed, I dont think it was reasonable for Sunny to have provided  him with any 
of the following instalments loans. 
While you stopped allowing Mr F to draw down  on the facility after this, you instead provided  him nine 
instalment loans shortly afterwards. I think that this had the same  effect as unfairly  allowing Mr F to 
continue to draw down  on the running account credit in a way that was unsuitable.  So, you should  
have seen that it was unlikely Mr F wouldve been able to sustainably repay  any of his subsequent  
instalment loans.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mr F applied for his sixth loan a pattern 
of lending had developed which made these loans unsustainable. I have considered  our adjudicators  
points, and Im minded to agree. I say this because:
When  Mr F took out loan 6, it was his 20th drawdown / loan in 15 months and it appears he had 
needed to borrow from Sunny for each of the preceding 12 months
By loan 6, I think there was a pattern in Mr Fs borrowing. It appears that on some occasions  Mr 
F was provided with new loans quickly  after he had repaid  previous ones.  Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr F was having to borrow further to cover the hole the 
repayment of his previous loans  left in his finances and that Mr Fs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Loan 10 was taken  out around 22 months after Mr Fs first drawdown   and although the value 
was slightly  smaller then previous instalment  loans his overall monthly  repayment hadnt 
significantly decreased.  So Mr F had in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think  that Mr F lost out when Sunny provided  loans 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging  Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit over an extended period of time and;
the sheer  number of loans would  more likely then not have  had negative implications on Mr Fs 
ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost loans.
So Im intending to uphold  Mr Fs complaint about all of his loans. Sunny should put things  right as 
detailed below.
