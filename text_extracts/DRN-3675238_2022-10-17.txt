The complaint
Mr R has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wont refund a 
withdrawal he says he didnt make or otherwise authorise.
What happened
Both sides are most familiar with the case, so Ill summarise things in brief.
In 2021, Mr Rs card and PIN were used to withdraw cash from an ATM abroad, in the city 
where he was staying at the time.
Mr R says this wasnt him or anyone he knew. He explained his card was kept in his mobile 
phone cover along with other valuable items. His phone was always with him, and neither his 
card nor any of the phone covers other contents went missing. His PIN was a random 
number only he knew, he hadnt recorded it or given it to anyone, and he hadnt let anyone 
use his card or account either. He suggested someone may have hacked the ATM or cloned 
his card, and he said the withdrawal was too early in the morning for him to have made it.
NatWest held Mr R liable for the transaction in dispute. They found that the withdrawal had 
been made using Mr Rs genuine card and the correct PIN on the first try, and they could 
see Mr R still had his card afterwards. They didnt see a likely way the withdrawal couldve 
been made without his permission.
Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr R 
didnt agree, so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Broadly, NatWest can hold Mr R liable for the transaction in dispute if he authorised it.
Im satisfied from NatWests technical evidence that the withdrawal in dispute used Mr Rs 
genuine card, and the correct PIN. It was not made using a cloned card or any other such 
methods as Mr R suggested. So I can see that this transaction was properly authenticated. 
The question, then, is whether the evidence suggests that its most likely Mr R consented to 
the withdrawal, or not.
First, Ive considered the possibility that someone who Mr R didnt know  e.g. a third party 
fraudster  made the withdrawal.
As above, Im satisfied that the withdrawal was made using Mr Rs real, genuine card. And 
the card was kept safe with Mr R at all times, so its not clear how a thief could have stolen 
the card without Mr R noticing. Further, Mr R kept other valuable belongings in the same 
place, but none of them went missing. And its unlikely that an opportunistic thief would not 
have stolen those as well.
More importantly, Mr R confirmed his card did not go missing and he still had it after the 
disputed withdrawal, which I can see is the case since he used it to make genuine payments 
afterwards. That means that if a thief were to have stolen his card, they would need to have 
given it back to him afterwards. I do not think it is likely or plausible that they would do that. 
Returning the card would drastically increase the thiefs chances of getting caught, while 
providing no benefit to themselves. It would even actively stop them from being able to steal 
more money using the card. Further, it is highly unlikely that Mr R would not notice a 
stranger accessing his phone cover, taking his card, and then putting the card back in the 
same place later  not least when, given the timings involved, they would likely need to have 
accessed his home.
So I dont see a likely or plausible way that an unknown fraudster could have used Mr Rs 
card. I also dont see a likely or plausible way they could have known his PIN, either.
Mr Rs PIN wasnt written down anywhere or given to anyone. And by the time of the 
disputed withdrawal, he hadnt made any payments with the PIN in several days  so there 
was no recent opportunity for a thief to watch him entering his PIN and learn it that way. The 
PIN was a random number, not one that could be easily guessed, and it is very unlikely 
indeed that a fraudster would happen to guess the right number on the first try.
Further, while this is a more minor point, I mightve expected a thief to try to take as much 
money as possible, as quickly as possible. But here, the person using the card didnt even 
withdraw the full daily limit, let alone try any other types of payments. They left a significant 
balance in the account and never made any further attempts to take money, despite having 
both the card and PIN in their possession. That does not fit well with the possibility that this 
was an unknown thief or fraudster.
Taking everything into account, there is not a likely or plausible way that an unknown party 
made this withdrawal.
Next, Ive considered the possibility that someone known to Mr R may have made the 
transaction without his permission, such as a close friend or family member. That is possible, 
but I dont think its likely. Again, its not likely that they wouldve been able to take and 
replace Mr Rs card without him noticing, not least when it was kept in a phone cover and his 
phone was always with him. And Mr R told both us and NatWest that no one he knew 
wouldve done this without his consent, so it seems Mr R has effectively ruled out this 
possibility himself.
Lastly, Ive considered the possibility that Mr R could have either made this withdrawal 
himself, or given someone else permission to make it for him. That fits very well with the 
evidence at hand. And people do sometimes forget transactions and mistakenly dispute 
them. Certainly, Ive not seen any evidence that makes it seem implausible or unlikely that 
Mr R couldve authorised this withdrawal or given someone else permission to make it.Mr R pointed out that there wouldve been difficulties making the withdrawal so soon after 
the pandemic-related curfew hours were over. But that would be true regardless of who 
made it  a thief or friend wouldve been affected by the same curfew. And it was still very 
much possible for Mr R to have made the withdrawal or given the use of his card to 
someone who couldve got to the ATM a bit more easily. So while I appreciate Mr Rs 
arguments around this point, I do not find it to be substantive to the outcome of the case.
I also do appreciate why Mr R would like to see CCTV footage. NatWest did not have the 
power to compel a foreign supermarket to provide CCTV footage. And such footage is only 
held for about a month or so, meaning its too late to view it now. But even if it were still 
available, it wouldve only shown what the person making the transaction looked like. It 
would not have shown whether they had Mr Rs permission or not. Because even if I accept 
that Mr R wasnt present at the withdrawal himself, it was still completely possible for him to 
have given someone else his consent to make it. And as I explained above, based on the 
evidence its not likely or plausible that the transaction was made without Mr Rs consent.
In summary, Im satisfied that Mr Rs genuine card and PIN were used. Based on the 
evidence, there isnt a likely way an unknown person did this, or that someone known to 
Mr R did this without his permission  indeed, Mr R himself seems to have ruled out that 
possibility. That leaves only one likely possibility  that Mr R made the transaction or gave 
someone else permission to make it. This is a difficult message for me to give, and I know 
its a difficult message for Mr R to receive. But given the evidence I have, and the balance of 
probabilities, Im unable to reasonably reach any other conclusion.
So while I know this will come as a disappointment for Mr R, and while it is not my intention 
to disappoint him, I cannot fairly tell NatWest to refund the disputed withdrawal.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I do not uphold Mr Rs complaint in this case.
This final decision marks the end of our services involvement in the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2022.
