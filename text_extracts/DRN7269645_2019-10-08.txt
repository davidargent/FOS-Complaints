K821x#15complaint
Mr W says Money  Solutions Limited  lent to him irresponsibly.  He says he had several  loans 
over the years and he got into a cycle of lending and repaying  which  he couldnt get out of.
background
This complaint is about 33 payday  loans  Money Solutions provided to Mr W between 
October 2012 and August 2015. Ive attached a table to the end of this decision that shows  
some of the information  Money Solutions  has provided about  the lending.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Money Solutions  disagreed  with the 
adjudicators opinion. It said that:
our adjudicator hadnt properly looked  at the affordability of all the lending. The 
checks Money Solutions did showed that Mr W could afford the repayments  
it was incorrect to say the loan amounts  were  increasing, the loan amounts were 
largely stable
Mr W would not have  been able to access other credit
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Money Solutions needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Mr W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Money Solutions should fairly  and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN72696452There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided  to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr W hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators opinion about  loans 1 to 6. Because of this 
I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making  a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr W had with 
Money Solutions. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other  
loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 33 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Money 
Solutions lending  history with Mr W, with a view to seeing if there was a point  at which  
Money Solutions should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so it should have realised  that it shouldnt  have provided any further 
loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I think at this point Money Solutions  shouldve moved  away from looking at individual 
monthly affordability checks and thought about its lending  relationship  with Mr W. I say this 
because:
up to loan 7 the amounts Mr W was borrowing had been increasing. And going 
forward Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  or weeks  of settling a 
previous one
I can accept that after loan 11 the size of the loans remained stable at around  £400 
until the very end of the lending where  it increased again. But this a large amount, it 
could be over half of Mr Ws disposable  income  even thought his outgoings may not 
have been very large
Money Solutions ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having  
to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness  was unsustainable
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Money Solutions. 
Loan 33 was taken out nearly  3 years  after his first. And it was for a larger amount. 
Mr W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Money 
Solutions over an extended period. This is a very long time to use a product that is 
essentially meant to smooth over short term cash flow problems
I think that Mr W lost out because Money  Solutions continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 7 onwards  because:
Ref: DRN72696453these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
Money Solutions has said that Mr W would be unable to access  mainstream  credit. 
Of course Mr W may have had problems doing this. But this may not have been the 
case over the longer  term and Mr Ws relationship  with Money  Solutions,  for this 
length of time, may have prevented Mr W from improving  his credit situation.  
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 to 33 and Money Solutions should  put things 
right.
putting things right  what Money Solutions needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 7 to 33;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 33 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Money  Solutions to take off tax from this interest. Money  
Solutions must give Mr W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint.
Money Solutions Limited should put things right by doing  what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 November  2019.
