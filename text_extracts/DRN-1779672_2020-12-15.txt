The complaint
This complaint is about a Birmingham Midshires-branded mortgage which until recently, 
Mr and Mrs Y held with Bank of Scotland plc. 
Mr and Mrs Y are unhappy that their monthly payment didnt reduce as the balance got lower 
over time. The mortgage was repaid in full earlier this year.
The main facts of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The main thrust of Mr and Mrs Ys complaint is the belief that as the outstanding mortgage 
balance fell over time, so too should their monthly payment as less interest was being 
charged. However, thats not how repayment (that is, capital and interest) mortgages work.
The easiest way to explain how repayment mortgages work is to use a fixed rate of interest 
for the entire term, as that way changes in interest rate dont confuse things. In reality, 
interest rates do change over the life of a mortgage  as happened here - and I can reassure 
Mr and Mrs Y that wouldnt have altered the underlying working of the mortgage. But for my 
example  for ease - I will use a fixed rate and I will round figures up or down.
If a customer borrowed £100,450 over a 16-year term at a fixed interest rate (for the entire 
term) of 6% then:
If it was an interest-only mortgage the customer would pay £502 every month for 
16 years and they would still owe £100,450 at the end of the term.
If it was a repayment mortgage the customer would pay £815 every month for 
16 years and they would owe nothing further at the end of the term.
The second example is how Mr and Mrs Ys mortgage has worked. Of that £815, in the early 
months £502 would go towards the interest (as per the interest only mortgage) so only £312 
would come off the capital. As time goes on, and the balance of the mortgage slowly comes 
down, then less of that £815 needs to go towards covering the interest.
Ive put a table together which illustrates broadly how a £100,450 repayment mortgage with 
a fixed interest rate of 6% for the entire 16-year term would work. All figures in the table are 
approximate and arent intended to replicate Mr and Mrs Ys mortgage, but the overall 
pattern would be the same.

As Ive rounded the figures for ease of reading the balance at the end of the 16th year 
actually ends up as minus £620, but that is just because of my rounding.
Hopefully this table reassures Mr and Mrs Y that it is entirely right that their payments 
havent gone down when the balance has reduced (unless, of course, interest rates 
decreased) and their mortgage has run exactly as I would expect.
If Mr and Mrs Ys payments had reduced in line with the balance, then the starting payment 
would have needed to have been much higher. Instead repayment mortgages set the same 
payment (so long as interest rates dont change) for the full term, otherwise the payments in 
the first few years could be excessively high.
If a repayment mortgage worked how Mr and Mrs Y seem to believe then the capital of 
£100,450 would have to be repaid evenly across the 16-year term, so the £100,450 would 
be divided into 192 equal monthly payments, and added onto that would be the interest each 
month. If the mortgage had worked that way then the customer in my example above would - 
in later years - have had lower monthly payments, but instead their starting payments would 
have needed to be around £1,025 a month (that is the £502 just to pay the interest, plus 
£523 as the equal monthly amount to the capital).
For as long as capital repayment mortgages have existed the monthly payment has been 
calculated from the outset as a level sum, designed to repay interest and capital over the 
term of the mortgage until nothing is left owing. As Mr and Mrs Y can see from my example, 
in the early years of the mortgage, the monthly payment is mostly interest, with only a very 
small capital reduction element. And over time, the proportion changes until in the final few 
years, almost all of the monthly payment is capital with very little interest. But unless 
something else changes, such as the interest rate or the mortgage term, the monthly 
payment itself wont change. Having considered everything, Mr and Mrs Ys mortgage has behaved exactly as I would 
expect it to and so I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. My final decision concludes this services consideration of this 
complaint, which means Ill not be engaging in any further consideration or discussion of the 
merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs Y to 
accept or reject my decision before 12 January 2021.
