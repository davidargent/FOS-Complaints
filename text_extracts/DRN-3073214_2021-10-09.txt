The complaint
Miss B complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to reimburse her when 
an item shed sold online didnt arrive and the buyer claimed a refund. 
Miss B wants a refund of the £34.10 sale price and the £12 PayPal dispute fee.
What happened
On 15 February 2021, Miss B sold a pair of trainers online for £34.10. She sent them to the 
buyer, using a delivery companys tracked service, on 17 February. 
The buyer didnt receive the trainers and on 12 March claimed a refund from PayPal. 
PayPal asked Miss B for more information to show the trainers had been delivered. It said it 
needed documentation to provide evidence of delivery to the buyers address, but it couldnt 
confirm delivery with the tracking information Miss B had provided. The last screenshot from 
the delivery firm was dated 18 February and had the message Weve got your parcel and 
were processing it for you.
As the parcel was stuck in transit, PayPal asked for shipping proof within a set timescale, 
and said Proof of shipping should be a copy of the actual shipping label on the package that 
shows the destination address and the shipping companys stamp to verify the shipment 
date.
Miss B wasnt able to provide this. So PayPal upheld the buyers claim on 18 March because 
the tracking number provided by Miss B showed no movement in the previous 21 days.
Miss B appealed but PayPal didnt change its decision. PayPal refunded the buyer, and 
debited the disputed £34.10, plus a £12 dispute fee, from Miss Bs PayPal account. Miss B 
complained, but PayPal didnt uphold her complaint, so Miss B complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint. She recognised that Miss B had tried to 
resolve this. But PayPals terms and conditions set out what Miss B would have had to 
provide, and Miss B hadnt been able to provide that. 
Miss B asked for an ombudsman decision. She said she appreciated that the investigator 
had acknowledged her losses. Shed originally bought the trainers for £90, and had lost the 
£34.10 shed sold them for, and the £12 PayPal dispute fee. Miss B said it wasnt okay for 
her to lose that much money, so she wanted to go further. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do understand why Miss B is frustrated at having lost the selling price of the trainers, plus 
PayPals dispute fee. And she thought shed provided enough information by providing a 
tracking number. But I have to look at what PayPals terms and conditions say about parcels 
which dont reach the buyer.
PayPals terms and conditions, which all customers have to accept when they open an 
account, offer Seller Protection. But there are criteria which the seller must meet, and be 
able to prove. There are multiple requirements, including:
You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your 
PayPal account
You must respond to PayPals requests for documentation and other information in a timely 
manner
You must provide proof of shipment or delivery.
The terms and conditions go on to list what would count as proof of shipment or delivery. 
Here, Miss B didnt have evidence of delivery from the delivery company, because it was 
stuck in transit. So what shed have had to provide would have been proof of shipment. The 
terms and conditions set out that proof of shipment required:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
-Date of shipment
-An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction 
Details page, or
-An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code. 
I recognise that Miss B hadnt expected there to be a problem with her parcel  and that she 
thought the tracking number would be enough to protect her. So she hadnt thought it would 
be necessary to obtain the detailed shipping proof. This meant she wasnt able to provide 
this information within PayPals timescales, because the parcel seems to have been stuck in 
transit. But that detailed proof, as Ive set out above, is what PayPal needed. And as the 
requirements are set out in the terms and conditions, I cant say that PayPal was wrong to 
require this proof. The £12 dispute fee is also set out in PayPals terms and conditions.
Its understandable that Miss B is upset about this. Shes said shell now take this up with the 
delivery company. But PayPals requirements were set out in the terms and conditions, and 
Miss B wasnt able to meet them. So I dont find that PayPal acted wrongly when it refunded 
the buyer and turned down Miss Bs claim for a refund of the £34.10 price of the trainers, 
and the £12 dispute fee. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 November 2021.
