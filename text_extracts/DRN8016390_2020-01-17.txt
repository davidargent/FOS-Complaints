K821x#15complaint
Mr W has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. To keep things  simple,  Ill 
refer mainly to Sunny.
Mr W says he was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
background
We now know that Mr W took out 12 loans from Sunny between June 2016  and October 
2016. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Ws borrowing  with Sunny, based on the information it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they didnt think  loans 1  5 were  
provided unfairly. But they thought  the complaint should be upheld  from the point  of loan 6 
onwards. We didnt hear back from Mr W, so Ive made the assumption he doesnt  disagree 
with this. Sunny told us it doesnt agree with the adjudicator and has asked for an 
ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ws 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr W could repay the loan he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amount being lent, the total 
repayment amount  and the consumers income  and expenditure.  
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN80163902refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  the loans, not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr W 
could sustainably make  the repayments.  But it doesnt automatically  follow  that this is the 
case. This is because  the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Neither party has disputed our adjudicators view that the lending for loans 1  5 wasnt 
unfair. So Ive only applied what Ive said above to the circumstances of loan 6 in the chain 
and beyond. 
Sunny told us it carried out certain checks before agreeing to lend to Mr W, including  
assessing his income,  expenditure  and net disposable income.  It says it also carried  out a 
credit check  to assess his creditworthiness. It says that all this information showed  that he 
would be able to make the loan repayments he was committing  to.  
However, by the point  of loan 6 there was a clear  pattern emerging of repeated  lending,  
demonstrated by the number of loans Mr W had asked for from Sunny. I note that as well as 
successfully applied-for loans there  were other  loan applications not proceeded with for 
differing reasons. At this point in the chain this was Mr Ws 6th such  loan in just 2 months and 
his borrowing thus far could be characterised  as back-to-back  lending with either no  or 
very little  gaps in between. 
I note that after loan 6 there were occasions  where  the repeated lending meant Mr W was 
asking to be lent money whilst previous loan instalments remained outstanding. At this point 
Sunny ought therefore to have realised  that Mr W was probably borrowing to meet  regular 
shortfalls in his income and to meet an ongoing  need. There was strong evidence  that he 
was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term lending and his indebtedness  
was becoming unsustainable. 
So from loan 6 - 12 Sunny had repeatedly lent in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on his ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr W, Sunny should:
Ref: DRN80163903Refund all interest  and charges Mr W paid on loans  6 to 12 inclusive;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement;
For loans 6 to 12 inclusive any information recorded about it is likely  to be adverse. 
So all entries about these should be completely removed from Mr Ws credit file. If 
Sunny has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr W a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Mr Ws complaint and direct  Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 February  2020.
