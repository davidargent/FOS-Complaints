The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) is refusing to refund him the 
amount he lost as the result of a scam. 
Mr C is being represented by a third party. To keep things simple, I will refer to Mr C 
throughout my decision.
What happened
Mr C saw an advertisement on Facebook for an investment. Interested in the opportunity Mr 
C completed an online form with his contact information and was contacted by the 
investment business. I will call this business X.
Mr C received a call from X and persuaded by its professional approach Mr C agreed to 
make an investment. Mr C started investing with a small amount but was soon persuaded by 
X to make larger payments to receive higher returns.
Mr C made the following payments from two separate accounts into the scam:

Mr C attempted to make a further payment into the scam that was stopped by NatWest. At 
the point the payment was stopped Xs demeanour changed and Mr C was bombarded with 
emails and phone calls. It was clear Mr C had fallen victim to a scam.
Our Investigator considered Mr Cs complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Mr C 
disagreed, so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Recovering the payments Mr C made
Upon investigating Mr Cs complaint NatWest found that the payments Mr C made went into 
cryptocurrency accounts in his name before being forwarded to X, meaning the scam 
occurred when the funds were transferred from the cryptocurrency accounts to the scammer.
When payments are made by card the only method of recovery NatWest has is to request a 
chargeback.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mr C was dealing with X, but Mr C didnt make the card payments to X directly. Instead, he 
paid a cryptocurrency exchange. This is important because NatWest was only able to 
process chargeback claims against the merchant Mr C paid, not another party.
The service provided by the cryptocurrency exchange would have been to convert or 
facilitate conversion of Mr Cs payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, it provided the 
service that was requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Mr C paid. So, a chargeback 
attempt would likely fail.
I have considered whether Mr C should have received a refund under the Contingent 
Reimbursement Model (CRM) code for payments he made by transfer. But the CRM code 
only applies when domestic payments (as the result of a scam) are sent to another person. 
Here Mr C sent the payments to an account held in his own name and the scam occurred 
when the purchased crypto was moved from that account to the scammer. Im satisfied the 
CRM code wouldnt apply in this scenario.
Should NatWest have reasonably prevented the payments Mr C made?Mr C has accepted he authorised the payments that were made from his account with 
NatWest, albeit on Xs instruction. So, the starting point here is that Mr C is responsible. 
However, banks and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect 
against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large 
transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether NatWest should have been aware of the scam and stepped in 
to prevent the payments from being made.
The first four payments Mr C made into the scam were of low value to what appeared to be a 
legitimate business. I think its reasonable that the payments did not trigger NatWests fraud 
prevention systems.
The remaining payments were to a new payee. But it wouldnt be reasonable for me to say 
NatWest should step in every time a customer pays a new business. The payments while 
higher in value were not significantly high, and Mr C had made large payments from his 
account in the months before. So, I dont think the value of the payments would reasonably 
have triggered NatWests fraud prevention systems either. The payments were also spread 
out over different days and formed a pattern of regular spending to trusted payees on Mr Cs 
account that he had no complaints about over several months. 
Overall, I dont think the payments Mr C made into the scam should reasonably have 
triggered NatWests fraud prevention systems. So, NatWest did not miss an opportunity to 
step in and prevent the scam taking place and is not responsible for Mr Cs loss.
Mr C has explained that the circumstances of his complaint are like another case our service 
has considered, and that has been upheld. But each case is considered on its own merits, 
and I am unable to comment on other cases within my decision.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2023.
