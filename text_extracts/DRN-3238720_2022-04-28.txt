The complaint
Mr B complains about the amount that hes been charged by Hitachi Capital (UK) plc, trading 
as Hitachi Capital Vehicle Solutions, at the end of a hire agreement under which a car had 
been supplied to him.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr B under a hire agreement with Hitachi Capital in October 
2018. He agreed to pay a first rental of £1,219.36 and then 23 monthly rentals of £406.45 for 
the car to be supplied to him. Mr B sent an email to Hitachi Capital about the arrears on his 
account in October 2020, before the agreement ended, and he contacted it again in 
December 2020 to arrange collection of the car but was told that hed need to transfer his 
personalised registration plate before the car could be collected. 
Mr B contacted Hitachi Capital again in March 2021 about the collection of the car and was 
told that he would need to transfer his personalised registration plate before the car could be 
collected. He then arranged the transfer and Hitachi Capital arranged for the collection  but 
the car couldnt be collected because it had a nail in a tyre when the third party came to 
collect it. The car was then collected from Mr B in April 2021 by a third party on behalf of 
Hitachi Capital. The third party inspected the car and identified damage which was recorded 
on an inspection report which included photos of the damage.
Hitachi Capital charged Mr B for the arrears on his account, additional rental for the period 
from the end of the minimum hire period until the car was collected (calculated on a daily 
rate of the monthly rental), the damage charges of £325 recommended by the third party and 
an aborted collection fee of £153.60. 
Mr B complained to Hitachi Capital about the charges and it agreed to reduce the charge for 
the damage to a post by £75 and to remove the charges for a chipped door (which reduced 
the total charge for damage from £325 to £185), and it credited £100 towards the arrears on 
his account as a gesture of goodwill because it could have offered more advice in October 
2020 about the return of the car. Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that she 
couldnt fairly say that Hitachi Capital had made an error or treated Mr B unfairly  but she 
said that it should work with him to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the 
£2,974.49 that he owed it. 
Mr B has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that he had 
several communications with Hitachi Capital by email and using the contact form on its 
website.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the agreement said that the minimum period of hire was 24 months starting on the 
date of the delivery of the car;
it also said: Once the minimum hire period has expired, the hiring of the Vehicle may 
continue for a secondary period unless either you or we give not less than 10 days 
prior written notice to terminate the hiring of the Vehicle on the last day of the 
minimum period. If the hiring does continue for a secondary period, then either you or 
we may terminate the secondary hire period by giving not less than 7 days prior 
written notice to the other. If not terminated earlier, this secondary period of hire will 
end six months after the last day of the minimum hire period;
Mr B contacted Hitachi Capital about the arrears on his account in October 2020 but 
didnt say that he wanted to end his agreement or for the car to be collected;
Hitachi Capital accepts that it could have offered more advice in October 2020 about 
the return of the car  and it has credited £100 towards the arrears on his account as 
a gesture of goodwill because of its failure to do so;
I consider that Mr B would have known, or ought reasonably to have known, that the 
minimum period of hire was ending in October 2020 and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have asked Hitachi Capital to arrange for the car to be 
collected from him if he wanted to end the agreement at that time;
Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for Hitachi Capital to have notified 
him that the minimum hire period was ending in October 2020;
Mr B contacted Hitachi Capital in December 2020 to arrange collection of the car but 
was told that hed need to transfer his personalised registration plate before the car 
could be collected  he then contacted it again in March 2021 and was again told that 
he would need to transfer his personalised registration plate before the car could be 
collected;
he then arranged the transfer of his personalised plate and Hitachi Capital arranged 
for the collection  but the car couldnt be collected because it had a nail in a tyre 
when the third party came to collect it;
the car was then collected from Mr B in April 2021 by a third party on behalf of 
Hitachi Capital;
even when Mr B was told in December 2020 that he would need to transfer his 
personalised registration plate before the car could be collected he didnt arrange the 
transfer and waited about three months before contacting Hitachi Capital again  and 
he then arranged the transfer;
Mr B continued to have the car after the minimum hire period had ended and I 
consider it to be more likely than not that he continued to use the car  the hire 
agreement said that the total allowed mileage during the period of hire was 20,000 
miles but when the car was inspected in April 2021 its mileage was recorded as 
24,464;
Hitachi Capital says that there are arrears on the account from August 2020 of 
£406.45 and that its charged Mr B for additional rental for the period from the end of 
the minimum hire period until the car was collected (calculated on a daily rate of the monthly rental) and its provided a screen shot showing that the total additional rental 
charge for the period from October 2020 to April 2021 is £2,329.44;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Hitachi Capital to charge Mr B for those 
amounts and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car 
should have been collected from Mr B earlier than it was or that Hitachi Capital has 
acted incorrectly in charging him for the additional rental;
after Mr B had arranged the transfer of his personalised registration number, Hitachi 
Capital arranged for a third party to collect  but the car couldnt be collected 
because it had a nail in one of its tyres when the third party came to collect it  
Hitachi Capital charged him £153.60 for the aborted collection and I consider that it 
was fair and reasonable for it to charge him that amount in these circumstances;
the car was then collected from Mr B in April 2021 by the third party, it inspected the 
car and identified damage to the car which was recorded on an inspection report with 
photos of the damage;
Hitachi Capital has agreed to reduce the charges for damage to the car from £325 to 
£185 (£50 to valet the car because it was returned in a soiled condition, £75 to repair 
a scratched post and £60 to repair a dented door); 
the agreement said: You will be responsible to us for any damage caused to or 
deterioration of the Vehicle otherwise than through fair wear and tear as indicated in 
the guidelines issued from time to time by the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing 
Association;
I consider that the condition of the car and the damage to the post and door are more 
than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with the 
British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear and I 
consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Hitachi Capital to 
charge him for that damage; and
Hitachi Capital says that the total amount owed by Mr B is £2,974.49 (which is the 
arrears of £406.45, the total additional rental of £2,329.44, £325 for the damage and 
£153.60 for the aborted collection  less the £140 reduction in the charge for damage 
and the £100, both of which it has credited to his account)  and Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to 
waive, or further reduce, any of those charges, to pay any compensation to Mr B or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr B contacts Hitachi Capital to either pay the amount that he owes it or, if 
hes unable to do so, to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for that amount. If 
he doesnt do so I consider it to be likely that Hitachi Capital will take further action, to the 
extent that its legally entitled to do so, to try to recover that money from him. If Mr B is 
experiencing financial difficulties, he should describe those difficulties to Hitachi Capital. Its 
required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes experiencing positively and 
sympathetically.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
