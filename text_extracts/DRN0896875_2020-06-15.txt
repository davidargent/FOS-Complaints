K821x#15complaint
Miss W says Elevate Credit International Limited trading Sunny lent to her irresponsibly. She 
says the loans which Sunny provided were  not affordable and she was not creditworthy. She 
says Sunny shouldnt  have  lent to her. 
background
This complaint is about 31 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss W between  May 2016 
and March 2018. Ive attached a table at the end of this decision  which  shows some of the 
information Sunny has provided about  this lending. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He didnt think  that Sunny was wrong  to 
approve loans  1 to 12. But he thought  that by loan 13 Sunny shouldve seen that the lending 
pattern itself was harmful and it shouldnt have lent from this point onwards.  
Sunny responded to the adjudicators opinion.  Essentially it said that loan 13 was too early to 
say the lending pattern was harmful. But it did offer to pay compensation from loan 26 
onwards. I havent  put this offer to the consumer as I was ready  to issue my decision when 
we received it. 
As no agreement was reached  the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN08968752There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint. Ive decided to uphold  Miss Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Miss W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about  loans  1 to 12. Because  of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss W had with 
Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans she 
took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 13 to 31 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Miss W, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think  that this point was reached  by 
loan 13. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss W was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out 13 loans  in around eight months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss W was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
And at this point  Sunny ought  to have known that Miss W was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  loan 13 onwards  Miss W was provided  with a new loan within  a short time of 
settling a previous  one previous  one. And she often had more  than one loan running 
at the same time.
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  31 was 
taken around two years after Miss Ws first. Miss W had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss W lost out because  Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 13 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN08968753the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 13 to 31 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  13 to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 13 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 13 to 31 should be removed from 
Miss Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Ws complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
