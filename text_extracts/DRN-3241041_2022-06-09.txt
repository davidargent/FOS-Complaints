The complaint
Mr L is unhappy with the service he received from MetLife Europe d.a.c whilst it handled his 
claim.
What happened
Mr L had an accident policy with MetLife. He claimed on his policy following a diagnosis of 
an illness. His complaint is centred around the way he was treated by MetLife during the 
claims handling process, in particular, the time it took for MetLife to give an answer to his 
claim and the way he was spoken to during a call. MetLife received Mr Ls claim form on 25 
August, but it wasnt until almost two months later that it was paid. 
MetLife acknowledged there were some delays and that it didnt always respond to Mr L in 
good time, however maintained that the majority of delays were subject to delays receiving 
information from Mr Ls GP. 
Our investigator didnt fully agree. He accepted MetLife had to wait for the GP to respond to 
its questions and he agreed this was reasonable for MetLife to validate his claim. But he 
noted there was a three-week delay from the beginning of September until 24 September 
2020, when MetLife eventually contacted Mr Ls GP. He said that MetLife should pay £150 
compensation for the overall trouble and upset caused. Our investigator didnt find in Mr Ls 
favour re: the phone call because he didnt find any evidence that MetLife had treated him 
unfairly on that point.
MetLife accepted our investigators findings, but Mr L didnt. In summary, he said that 
MetLife should pay him 20% of the value of his claim as a way of apology. He explained that 
a higher level of compensation would send a clear message to MetLife that it should treat its 
customers fairly from the outset. He said the £150 compensation isnt enough because it 
doesnt punish the insurer enough. Hes worried thisll mean MetLife wont take its actions 
seriously in the future. And so, its for me to make a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint, but for the same amount of 
compensation as already suggested by our investigator. I think the £150 compensation fairly 
reflects the level of trouble and upset caused and for the same reasons. Ill explain why. 
It's not in dispute that MetLife caused a delay whilst handling Mr Ls claim. Hed spoken with 
MetLife on 4 September and asked for an update, only to be told his claim was in hand. But 
it wasnt until almost three weeks later that there was any real, meaningful movement on his 
claim. The 24 September is when it was decided that additional medical evidence was 
needed, and that MetLife would need to contact the GP. This couldve been decided much 
sooner and perhaps when Mr L contacted it on 4 September for an update. Its unclear why 
this happened, but MetLife has accepted responsibility for its actions here and agreed with 
the recommended compensation made by our investigator. 
I accept Mr Ls arguments that this was a serious concern of his and that it caused him 
unnecessary trouble and upset. He maintained regular contact with MetLife during that time 
and wasnt given clear answers about the progress of his complaint. But that doesnt mean 
he should receive 20% of the value of his claim as compensation. I say that because its not 
for the ombudsman to punish MetLife for making a mistake. The ombudsman considers 
complaints and looks to put things right where errors have occurred. I note Mr Ls claim was 
paid almost two months later at the end of October 2020, but I should highlight there were 
delays with Mr Ls GP responding to MetLifes request for additional information. And I dont 
think it fair to hold MetLife responsible for that. 
MetLife also needed to validate his claim so it could decide whether to accept it. In order for 
it to do that, it needed to discuss the specifics of Mr Ls illness so that it could fairly 
determine whether his symptoms began during the period he was insured. And so, whilst I 
understand this felt uncomfortable for Mr L, I should like to reassure him that this was 
necessary for it to do that. I didnt find any evidence of MetLife treating him any differently to 
other consumers in similar stages of that process. I also note the adviser explained and 
apologised during the conversation for asking any questions that made Mr L feel 
uncomfortable  which I thought was fair.
I think £150 compensation is fair as it adequately and fairly acknowledges the impact the 
delay caused overall. Its for these reasons, I wont be asking MetLife to pay anything more 
in the circumstances. 
My final decision
Im upholding this complaint and MetLife Europe d.a.c must now pay Mr L £150 
compensation for overall trouble and upset caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
