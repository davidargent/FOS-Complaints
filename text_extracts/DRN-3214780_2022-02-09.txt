The complaint
Mr R complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money provided him with a 
loan that he was unable to afford to repay.  
What happened
It appears that from the information we have been given, Mr R was given the following loan 
by 118 118 Money:
LoanDate 
takenAmount TermMonthly 
repaymentAmount 
receivedDate 
repaid
2123519 29/10/2018 £1,75012
months£202.86 £1,750 11/10/2019
Mr R contends that he would have had a poor credit rating at the time due to two defaulted 
credit cards totalling over £5,000. As a result he struggled to pay back the loan and had to 
borrow more money in doing so. He believes that 118 118 Money didnt carry out adequate 
affordability checks.
On referral to this service our adjudicator didnt think there was anything in the information 
118 118 it gathered to have indicated he was in any financial difficulty, which meant it 
shouldnt have lent to Mr R.
Mr R disagreed, and the matter has been passed to me for further consideration. He hasnt 
provided any further documentary evidence of his finances. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to consider whether 118 118 Money completed reasonable and proportionate checks 
to satisfy itself that Mr R would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way and/or without 
experiencing significant adverse consequences. Then taking that into account I have to 
consider whether in the circumstances 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision.
Mr R approached 118 118 money for a loan in October 2018. He was required to complete a 
detailed application online setting out details of his income and outgoings and to confirm that 
he was able to afford the repayments. 118 118 Money also carried out a credit report. Its 
affordability calculations assessed that his income (as declared by Mr R) was £2,200 a 
month, that he was a homeowner and after meeting his commitments his monthly disposable 
income was around £1,450. It assessed that he was able to afford the loan.
I think the checks carried out by 118 118 Money were reasonable and proportionate taking 
into account the amount of the loan and the period of repayment. Mr R hadnt taken out any 
recent loans and he wasnt running an overdraft on his bank account. The one item of 
concern on the credit report was a delinquent credit card balance of £2,409 which was 
frozen, although he didnt appear to be making any payments towards this. However even if I 
were to take into account that he may have been required to make payments towards this he 
could have done so over a 12 month period and would still, on the evidence disclosed by 
these checks, have easily been able to afford the 118 118 Money loan.
I understand that Mr R did struggle to repay the loan. He says he has outstanding credit card 
commitments of £5,000. However the only credit card balance shown on the credit report 
was the £2,409 I have referred to. Mr R was asked as a part of his application to state 
whether he was able to afford the loan and to give full details of his income and outgoings 
and any change in circumstances which could have affected his ability to repay the loan. 
Credit reports dont necessarily give full details of a consumers credit history. Mr R advised 
us that he would be providing statements to evidence what hes said about his finances. 
However hes been unable to do this.
I think in the circumstances of the case118 118 Money made a fair lending decision.
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
