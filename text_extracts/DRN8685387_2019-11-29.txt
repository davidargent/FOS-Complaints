K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  gave him loans  
irresponsibly.
background
This complaint is about 53 loans Sunny provided to Mr C between  June 2015 and 
September 2018. They were variously  due to run for either six, twelve or twenty four months  
and the amounts borrowed ranged between £50 and £400  with most of Mr Cs borrowing 
falling between £100 and £300.
Sunny made an offer to settle Mr Cs complaint  but Mr C didnt accept this.
Mr C said that hed struggled to cut his costs and Sunny  shouldve  done more to prevent him 
from taking these unaffordable loans.
Theres a table at the end of my decision which shows more information  about the loans. All 
the loans were repaid early.
Our adjudicators overall view was that the pattern of lending itself showed that from loan 6 
onwards the borrowing was unsustainable   so Sunny  shouldnt  have given Mr C loan 6 
(taken on 28 October 2015) or any further loans.
To put things right our adjudicator recommended that Sunny should  refund all interest and 
charges Mr C had paid on the loans from 28 October 2015 until 8 September 2018  (loans  6 
through to 53), plus interest on the refunds, and amend his credit file to remove  all 
information about these loans from Mr Cs credit file.
Sunny looked  again at Mr Cs complaint and made  a revised  offer to uphold  the complaint  
from loan 20 onwards as Mr C had by then been paying interest on his Sunny borrowing for 
twelve months onwards.  
But, so far as the other loans were  concerned, Sunny said (in summary)  that it made all the 
proper enquiries  and checks and Mr Cs loan repayments were  deemed to be affordable  and 
sustainable. It said that as all the loans  were paid off early, and there were gaps in lending,  
this showed that Mr C borrowed what he needed and was able to repay these loans back 
without any difficulty. Sunny didnt accept that granting these loans  was unreasonable.
Mr C didnt think Sunnys settlement offer went far enough  and it fell short  of what  our 
adjudicator recommended. 
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Ref: DRN86853872Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  loans  1-4 were proportionate. The 
amounts that Mr C needed to repay  would  have seemed relatively affordable  compared  with 
the disposable income hed declared.  Given these repayment amounts, what  was apparent 
about Mr Cs circumstances at the time, and his borrowing  history  with Sunny, I dont think it 
wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask Mr C for the amount of information  that would 
be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing the first four loans.  
Ref: DRN86853873But by loans  5,6,7  and 8 I think Sunny should have  realised  that it was no longer reasonable 
to base its lending  decision  on the information Mr C was providing. I think it would have been 
proportionate for Sunny  to have  taken steps  to independently check the true state of his 
finances.
Given the number  of loans Mr C was asking for in quick  succession  (and frequently  when he 
was already paying existing Sunny loans),  and the fact hed been  indebted  to Sunny (bar a 
short debt free gap between  loans  5 and 6) since taking his first loan around six months 
earlier, I think Sunny shouldve looked further  into Mr Cs circumstances when  he took out 
loans 5-8.
If Sunny had done proportionate checks for loans 5  8, this would most likely  have shown  
that Mr C had also been borrowing with other short term lenders for some time, and he had 
outstanding borrowing with other  providers  when Sunny provided loan 5 to him  and from 
then on. 
But Ive taken into account that loans  2 and 3 were  for £50 each  a relatively small amount 
compared to his declared income and expenditure. His borrowing with other lenders around 
this time was also for relatively  small amounts  seemingly keeping his overall indebtedness 
affordable. And he appeared to be managing  his borrowing at this stage as it looks like he 
was repaying all his debt. So, on balance, I dont find I have enough evidence safely to 
conclude that Sunny shouldnt have provided loans  5 - 8.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  by loan 9 Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was likely  to be unsustainable and it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  I say this because at this point Sunny ought to have 
realised:   
Since June 2015 Mr C had taken out 9 loans in under six months  
Mr C was not managing to repay  his loans  sustainably. Hed borrowed again three 
times shortly after repaying  earlier loans   Loan  4 started 3 days  after paying Loan 2, 
Loan 5 a week or so after paying Loan 3 and around  the same  time (within a day or 
so it appears)  of paying loan 4. He took out further loans in October and November 
2015 (loans 6/7/8) after repaying  loans 1 and 5 in September 2015. And shortly after 
repaying loans  6 and 7 Mr C applied to borrow his 9th loan  which was for £300  
the largest single  amount (by quite a big margin)  hed taken since  loan 1. 
By now,  Mr C had been borrowing from Sunny for almost six months. So I dont think  
Sunny couldve  reasonably considered  that he needed the money to cover a one-off 
issue.
I think that when  Mr C asked to borrow Loan 9 this ought to have made Sunny realise 
that he wasnt managing to make any headway into clearing his overall  debt.
Mr Cs repeated lending requests meant  it wasnt reasonable of Sunny to think his 
situation had improved and he was now asking to borrow because  of a new need for 
a short  term loan rather than an ongoing  problem 
by loan 9, Mr Cs overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans
Ref: DRN86853874Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr C was borrowing further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Cs borrowing wasnt sustainable. 
Ive carefully considered  everything Sunny has said, including its response  to our 
adjudicators view. In the overall context  of his borrowing,  I dont think that any of the gaps in 
lending (including  the gap between  loans 10 and 11) were  long enough  for Sunny 
reasonably to say there was effectively a break  in the lending  chain when it looked like Mr C 
had been able to put his finances in order. For the reasons  Ive explained, I think Sunny 
shouldve seen that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably by the time he took 
out loan 9  and it shouldve realised then that it was unfair  to provide that loan and to 
continue to lend to him from that point onwards.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
I appreciate that Mr C repaid some loans quite quickly  when the contractual  
repayment term was much longer. But when Sunny  agreed these loans it didnt  know 
when he might repay them.
The sheer number  of loans and the length  of time over which Mr C borrowed were  
likely to have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit 
and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost  loans. By the time Mr C had 
already borrowed  nine loans in a row any further borrowing was likely to be 
detrimental to his credit  rating.
I think Sunny shouldve been  concerned that Mr Cs continued borrowing had 
become unsustainable by loan 9. Successfully repaying his loans early doesnt mean 
he managed to do so in a sustainable way. And borrowing and repaying this number 
of loans early suggests to me that Mr Cs finances were not in a stable position. 
I dont think Sunnys offer (to uphold the complaint  from loan 20 onwards) goes far 
enough to put things  right fro Mr C for the reasons I've explained. 
So Im planning  on upholding  the complaint about  loan 9 through to loan 53 and telling 
Sunny it should  take steps to put things right.  
what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
Sunny said it has reviewed its position and is now willing to uphold Mr Cs complaint from 
loan 14 onwards on the basis  that this is a fair and reasonable outcome overall.
Mr C has confirmed that hes happy  with what I've said in my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN86853875Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.  
Having done so, after taking carefully  into account  everything thats  been  said in response to 
my provisional decision, I dont consider  that Sunny has said anything  that affects my overall 
view. In particular,  I dont think the gap in lending between loans 10 and 11 was long enough 
for Sunny reasonably  to say that Mr C mightve  put his finances in order  during this period.
So I still think its fair to uphold this complaint from loan 9 onwards for the reasons 
I explained in my provisional decision.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loan 9 and all the other loans after that 
(ie loans taken between 9 December 2015 and 8 September  2018)and pay interest 
of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date they were  
paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 9 through  to loan 53 (see the loan 
table below) should  be removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  this complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) to pay Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 December  2019.
