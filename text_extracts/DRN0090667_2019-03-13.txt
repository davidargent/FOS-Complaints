K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs K complain  that Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) unfairly refused to do a 
chargeback on payments  they made to a holiday club.
background
In 2018 Mr and Mrs K approached Halifax to request a chargeback for payments they made 
to a holiday club in 2002 and 2003. They felt the holiday  club misrepresented  its services so 
they thought Halifax should be able to help them get their money back.
Halifax said it couldnt find any evidence of the payments so it couldnt  perform a 
chargeback. But Mr and Mrs K werent happy  with this so they came  to this service.  Our 
adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. So Mr and Mrs K asked for review by 
an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I can understand Mr and Mrs Ks 
frustration that they havent had the service they expected from the holiday club.  But I 
havent seen any evidence that the payments were made from Mr and Mrs Ks Halifax 
account. 
In any event, if the payments were made by bank transfer they wouldnt be eligible for the 
chargeback scheme  which is only available for card purchases. And if they were  made by 
card, the chargeback would have  to have been requested within  540 days  of the payment. 
These payments  were made  many  years ago, therefore I dont  think  Halifax was wrong to 
refuse the chargeback in the circumstances.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, its my final decision that this complaint  is not upheld.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs K to 
accept or reject my decision  before  13 April 2019.
