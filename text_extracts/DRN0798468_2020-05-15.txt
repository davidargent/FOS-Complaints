K821x#15complaint
Miss S is unhappy with the credit  limit increases NewDay  Ltd applied  to her credit card 
accounts. She thinks this was irresponsible lending. Miss S wants a refund of the interest 
and charges caused by the credit  limit increases. She also wants the defaults for these 
accounts to be removed from her credit  file. 
background
Miss S had credit card accounts with NewDay. These were  branded  as an Aqua credit  card 
and a Marbles credit card.  The Aqua  card was taken out in July 2011.  The Marbles  account 
was opened in August 2015. 
In July 2016 Miss S told NewDay she was having difficulty  making  the payments on these 
accounts. It put her accounts on hold and asked  for details of her income and outgoings. 
Over the next few months,  arrears built up on the accounts. By the end of the year, NewDay  
had issued default notices to Miss S and sold her accounts to a debt management company 
who Ill call L. Defaults were registered  for the accounts in early 2017.  
Miss S complained to NewDay about her credit limits being  increased on her accounts. She 
was also unhappy  with how long it had taken  NewDay to deal with a data subject access  
request (DSAR) some  months before. NewDay rejected her complaint. In short,  it said it was 
confident it had raised the limits responsibly and there was no record  of Miss S opting  out of 
the increases.  NewDay also told her that her DSAR  had been sent within the relevant 
timescales. 
Miss S didnt accept  this. She brought her complaint to our service  where  it was looked at by 
one of our adjudicators. Briefly, he said the credit  limit increases  on the Aqua credit card in 
2014 and 2015 were  fairly applied. But he didnt think NewDay had carried  out proportionate 
checks for the subsequent limit increases on each account. Our adjudicator thought NewDay  
should refund the interest and charges  on these  accounts from November 2015  to when the 
accounts were sold to L. He also thought  the default  amounts should  reflect  the account 
balances as at August  2015. 
Our adjudicator could  also see that Miss Ss DSAR request hadnt been sent to the right 
department and this had caused a lengthy  delay. He asked NewDay to pay her £50 for the 
trouble and inconvenience  this had caused. 
NewDay didnt agree with our adjudicators  opinion. In summary it said,  the credit limit 
increases only increased Miss Ss repayments by a small amount that was proportionate to 
her disposable  income.  
As this matter remains unresolved, its been  passed  to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided to uphold  it 
in part. Ill explain why. 
In reaching my decision Ive thought about  the relevant regulations  and industry best 
practices. When NewDay told Miss S it was increasing her credit  limit, I would expect it to 
Ref: DRN07984682give her at least 30 days notice of the increase.  I would also expect NewDay  to give her the 
option not to have the increase. Ive looked  at the letters  NewDay  sent to Miss S. Im 
satisfied these all give her more  than 30 days notice and the option not to have her limit 
increased. Theres nothing to show Miss S wanted  to opt out of the increases. 
Ive also thought about the checks NewDay should have done when offering to raise  the 
credit limits. The regulations here required NewDay to carry out a creditworthiness  
assessment on Miss S before it significantly increased her credit  limits.  The assessment 
should have been appropriate and proportionate  to her circumstances. 
I can see from NewDays records that Miss S took out the Aqua card in July 2011.The credit 
limit was £800. It remained at this level until July 2014 when it was increased to £1,550.  It 
remained at this level until August the following year. At this point, the limit was raised  to 
£2,300. That same month, the Marbles account  was opened with a limit of £900. 
Ive looked at the available evidence for these  lending decisions. This includes the details 
NewDay considered  when increasing  the Aqua limit and, the Marbles application details. 
Having done so, Im satisfied theres nothing to show the credit worthiness checks carried 
out by NewDay  werent  appropriate and proportionate to Miss Ss circumstances  at the 
relevant time. Similar to our adjudicator, I think these limit increases were applied  fairly. 
But the next limit increase  on the Marbles account   took place in November 2015. The 
limit was doubled by £900  to £1,800  a significant  increase. This was only a few months  
after the account opened and since the last increase on the Aqua account. During this period 
I can see that Miss S made numerous  cash withdrawals on both accounts.  She was also 
charged a late payment  fee on the Aqua account.  
One missed or late payment may have been indicative that the level of affordability risk for 
Miss S was high. When considered alongside the number of cash  withdrawals since August 
2015, I think the affordability  risk level only increased. I also think it would have been 
appropriate and proportionate in the situation here for NewDay  to have looked more  closely 
into Miss Ss income and outgoings. 
Our adjudicator calculated  that after the November 2015 limit increase on the Marbles  
account, Miss Ss outstanding debt level represented over 50% of her gross  annual income. 
NewDay said it would unreasonable to view it in this way as the principle of credit  is to 
spread the cost of purchases over a period of time. It accepted Miss Ss total exposure  was 
high but NewDay  also said it didnt think Miss Ss ability to clear  the balance over time had 
been considered.  
I would point out that another  potential indicator that the level of affordability risk is high is 
where the total value of a customers  debts  relative to their income  is high. As Ive just said,  
NewDay accepts this was the case here. 
Ive also thought about Miss Ss ability to clear the outstanding balances on her accounts 
over time. Central to this would be the level of her disposable monthly income  that is the 
difference between  her income and outgoings  each month. The available  evidence  doesnt 
show NewDay assessed this when deciding to increase  the Marbles credit limit in November 
2015. Taking these  potential  risk indicators into account, Im not satisfied that NewDays  
creditworthiness check was appropriate and proportionate to Miss Ss circumstances.  
Ref: DRN07984683After November 2015 there were two more significant credit limit increases in quick 
succession. These were: an increase of £750  on the Aqua account in February 2016; and, a 
£600 increase  to the Marbles account two months  later. 
I can see from Miss Ss statements that she was still making  regular cash  withdrawals using 
both accounts.  There were also further late payment  fees on each account. So the risk 
indicators present in November 2015  were also present when these  further limit increases 
were made. Once again, in this situation Im not satisfied that NewDays  creditworthiness 
checks for these limit increases were appropriate  and proportionate  to Miss Ss 
circumstances. So I dont  think it was fair and reasonable to apply these  increases. 
So, I think NewDay should refund the interest  and charges applied  to both accounts from the 
date of the limit increase on the Marbles account in November 2015 to when the accounts  
were sold to L. As both accounts have been sold, the refunds should  be used to reduce the 
balances that Miss S owes  to L. 
Ill now turn to Miss Ss DSAR request. NewDay told her it had dealt with this within  the 
relevant timescales.  But thats not quite  right. I can see NewDay received her request on 5 
February 2018. But it didnt pass it on to the correct department. NewDay  didnt supply 
Miss S with the required  information until August 2018. That is a long way outside  the 
relevant timescales.  NewDay  should  pay Miss £50 for the trouble and upset this caused her. 
I think this is proportionate to the situation  here. 
For completeness, once Miss S told NewDay Ltd about  her financial difficulties in July 2016 I 
can see that it treated  her positively and sympathetically. It placed an immediate hold on her 
account while it asked  her for details of her income  and outgoings. NewDay then went  on to 
accept payments of £1a month on the accounts.  As Miss Ss financial difficulties didnt  look 
to be short  term, I think NewDay correctly defaulted  the accounts  when  the arrears  built up. 
Im satisfied this was fair and reasonable. 
Finally, our adjudicator thought the default amounts on Miss Ss accounts  should reflect the 
balances as at August  2015. I dont agree. The defaults should be an accurate reflection of 
how Miss S maintained  her accounts.  Its very difficult to assess whether these accounts 
would have gone into default if NewDay hadnt  increased the credit limits from November 
2015 onwards.  
But, from the available evidence provided  by both NewDay and Miss S, including  details of 
her employment status, I think that on balance, its more likely than not that the accounts 
would have defaulted. This means  theres no basis to tell NewDay to amend the default 
details with the credit reference agencies. Ive explained this to Miss S via one of our 
investigators. Im please to see she accepts this. 
Ref: DRN07984684my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. 
NewDay Ltd should arrange to refund  the interest  and charges on Miss Ss Aqua and 
Marbles accounts as outlined above. It should also pay her £50 for the trouble and upset 
shes experienced. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 June 2020.
