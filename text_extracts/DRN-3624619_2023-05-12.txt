The complaint
Mr B complains that PayrNet Limited hasnt refunded him a payment that was transferred 
into his account with it and that its closed his account without paying him the balance.
What happened
In November 2021, Mr B sent the balance of an account he held with another business to his 
account with PayrNet. The transaction was declined by PayrNet and the money returned to 
the other business. But at the point the money was returned, Mr Bs account with that 
business had been closed and so Mr B wasnt sure what had happened to the payment.
Mr B made PayrNet aware of this the day after the payment was made. PayrNet told Mr B 
that the transaction had been declined because it exceeded the amount that could be paid 
into his account in one day. Mr B told PayrNet why he didnt believe this was the case. But 
he didnt receive any responses to a number of messages he sent to PayrNet over several 
months about this. PayrNet then closed Mr Bs account without any notice and he despite his 
requests, PayrNet didnt pay him the balance of his account. 
As he hadnt heard back from PayrNet, Mr B brought a complaint to this service. We asked it 
for more information about the complaint, but PayrNet didnt respond. So one of our 
investigators considered the case based on what we had. They said that Mr Bs account was 
limited to a total balance and there were limits on his deposits too  both of which the 
attempted transfers from the other business would have exceeded. So this was why the 
payments were declined.
The investigator felt that PayrNet hadnt been helpful in how it dealt with this situation 
though. It hadnt helped Mr B with the payment and hadnt responded to his messages, or 
given any notice about his account being closed. So our investigator thought that PayrNet 
should refund Mr B the amount of the payment in question and then contact the other 
business to recover the funds, along with paying Mr B the balance of his account. also 
recommended that it pay £300 for the distress and inconvenience caused and pay 8% 
interest on the money Mr B had been without.
PayrNet didnt respond at all, despite our service chasing it. So the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My ability to do so here is limited by PayrNets lack of any response to this services 
investigation. So I have to consider this complaint based on the evidence I do have and in 
doing so, Ive taken account of PayrNets failure to provide the information weve requested. 
This is in line with the Dispute Resolution rules (in particular - DISP 3.5.9R (3)) that apply to 
this service, which are laid out in the FCA Handbook.
It does seem that the most likely explanation for the initial payment being unsuccessful was 
because it exceeded the relevant limits on Mr Bs account. Based on what we know, I think it 
was likely fair for PayrNet to have returned the funds here. In this situation, it wouldnt 
usually be fair to hold PayrNet liable for Mr B being without that money, where PayrNet has 
returned it to the other business. In these circumstances, the usual thing would be for Mr B 
to pursue that with the other business.
But, PayrNet has never shown us that it returned the funds in the way it suggests. Nor has it 
provided any explanation for what it did. So, weve asked the other business for its records 
of what happened. These records show a number of attempted transfers to PayrNet, all of 
which were unsuccessful  until one final transfer (chronologically the last one Mr B made on 
the relevant date of 15 November 2021) was successful. That payment was made to 
PayrNet and left Mr Bs account with the other business with no remaining funds.
So the evidence we have shows that PayrNet looks to have received this money from the 
other business. It may be that there is some reason that PayrNet hasnt released this to Mr B 
 but it hasnt told us about any administrative issues, or other concerns it may have in 
relation to this. So, looking at things on the basis of the evidence I have  it looks to be that 
Mr B did transfer the amount in question to PayrNet and that it hasnt given him this money. 
Without being provided with any reason to think that Mr B isnt entitled to this, it follows that 
itd be fair and reasonable for PayrNet to pay this to him. This is along with 8% interest on 
the amount, payable from when he made the payment on 15 November 2021, to when 
PayrNet pays the amount back after acting on this decision.
There is then the issue of Mr Bs account being closed and him not being allowed access to 
any balance in his account. Again, PayrNet hasnt explained why its closed his account 
immediately, without notice and nor has it explained why it wont allow Mr B access to the 
balance that was in the account. There are certain circumstances where PayrNet would be 
entitled to do that, but it hasnt provided anything to support that this is the case here.
So without any good reason to not give Mr B access to his money, it follows that its fair and 
reasonable to expect it to do so here. That means that PayrNet should pay Mr B any balance 
thats left in his PayrNet account, along with 8% interest payable from when Mr B first made 
this instruction, to when PayrNet pays the amount back after acting on this decision.
All of this will have caused Mr B some confusion, frustration and inconvenience. Hes been 
without money, which he appears to be entitled to, and hes not had any answers to his 
complaint or questions for a significant period of time. For this, I think PayrNet should 
compensate Mr B and I think £300 is fair and reasonable for this.My final decision
I uphold this complaint. PayrNet Limited must:
refund the payment of £1,803.83 to Mr B, along with 8% simple interest calculated 
from 15 November 2021 until the date this is refunded
pay Mr B any remaining balance left in his account at the point it was closed, along 
with 8% simple interest calculated from when Mr B first instructed PayrNet to do this, 
until the date it is paid to him
pay Mr B £300 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its handling of the 
matter
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2023.
