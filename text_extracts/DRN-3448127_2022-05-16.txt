Miss F complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to 
her. 118 118 Money didnt uphold her complaint. 
Miss F referred her complaint to us. Our adjudicator didnt uphold it. She thought 118 118 
Money had made a fair lending decision in respect of the first loan. She didnt think it had 
carried out proportionate checks in respect of the second loan but didnt uphold that part of 
the complaint because it wasnt clear what 118 118 Money would have found if it had 
investigated Miss Fs circumstances further.
As Miss F didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Miss Fs complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Miss F would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Miss F wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Miss Fs ability to make the repayments under these 
agreements. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loans wouldnt cause Miss F undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means she should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment she had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on her financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Miss F. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Fs complaint.
Loan 1
When Miss F applied for the loan, she told 118 118 Money that her salary was £23,000 a 
year. Its likely that her net monthly income was around £1,500. She said she lived with her 
parents and had expenses of £580. 118 118 Money said it carried out a credit search and 
verified Miss Fs income using industry standard checks. 
The credit search revealed that Miss F owed a total of £986 and was paying around £100 on 
her existing credit commitments. So it appeared that she wasnt over-committed financially.I think as this was Miss Fs first loan with 118 118 Money, the checks were reasonable and 
proportionate. It appeared that Miss F would have a healthy amount of disposable income 
after making the loan repayment to 118 118 Money. I think 118 118 Money made a fair 
lending decision in the circumstances.
Loan 2
At the time she applied for this loan, Miss F said her income was £1,500 a month and her 
expenses £750. 118 118 Money carried out the same checks as for Loan 1.
By this time Miss Fs total borrowing had increased to £4,448 and shed opened two new 
accounts in the last six months. Two months earlier shed taken out a loan of £3,000. I think 
118 118 Money should have questioned why she needed to borrow a further £2,000 within 
such a short time. So I dont think on this occasion 118 118 Moneys checks were 
proportionate.
But although I dont think the checks 118 118 Money did before agreeing the loan were 
sufficient, that isnt enough of a reason for me to uphold this part of Miss Fs complaint. In 
order for the complaint to succeed I would also need to be able to say that proportionate 
checks would have shown 118 118 Money that Miss F couldnt sustainably afford the loan 
repayments.
Although Ive concluded that 118 118 Money should have carried out further checks for the 
loan, Im not sure what it would have seen if it had done so as Miss F hasnt provided us 
with bank statements or other documentation from around the time she applied for the loan. 
Im not suggesting here that these are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily 
have done. But I think looking at these would have given a good indication of Miss Fs 
financial situation around the time she applied for this loan. As I cant say with any certainty 
that 118 118 Money would have uncovered information showing the loan would be 
unaffordable for Miss F, Im not able to uphold her complaint.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Miss Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2022.
