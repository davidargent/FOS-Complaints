The complaint
Miss T complains that NewDay Ltd lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Miss T complained about the card that NewDay opened for her in 2016. She told us she was
in a seriously bad financial situation then with a poor credit rating, multiple payday loans, one
after the other for some years, as well as high-cost loans and private borrowing. And shed
frequently missed payments to her other credit cards. She said this was all visible on her
credit file at the time, and she didnt think NewDay shouldve lent her this money.
Miss T said that her first NewDay card was maxed out and she was only making minimum
payments. Shed also been over her limit and had late or missed payment penalties. She
said this debt had affected her mental health, and shed only made progress repaying this
card when she asked NewDay to block it.
Miss T wanted NewDay to refund the interest and charges plus statutory interest, and to 
delete any negative information from her credit record.
Miss T said that although shed only complained about the first card NewDay opened for her,
it had then blocked the second card she held too. But she didnt mind, as this would help her
pay it off quicker.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said it looked at all the lending it made to
Miss T, even though shed only complained about the first of two cards it opened for her.
NewDay said Miss T applied for her first card on 5 October 2016. She said then that she was
employed earning £26,500, and had unsecured debts of £3,800. NewDay said the external
information it received at the time said that she had no defaults, no county court judgments
(CCJs) no accounts in arrears, no payday loans, and had five other lending accounts. So it
opened a card for her, with £900 of credit. That limit was never increased. Miss T asked to
close the card on 2 April 2018, and its been open for repayments only since then.
NewDay said Miss T then applied for a second account on 21 March 2020. She said then
that she was employed earning £30,000, and had unsecured debts of £5,800. Her
accommodation costs were £500 a month and living expenses were £600 a month. NewDay
said the external information it received at the time was that she had no defaults, no CCJs,
no accounts in arrears, no payday loans, and had nine other lending accounts. So it opened
a card for her, with £500 of credit. That limit was never increased. Shed asked for an
increase on 6 August 2020, but NewDay said no.
NewDay said that in light of the comments Miss T made about being unable to afford her
accounts, it had closed Miss Ts second card for future spend. That would also remain open
for repayments only.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said NewDay had
assessed Miss Ts financial position when she applied for these cards, and the information it
reviewed didnt point towards the risk being too high for the lending, even though our
investigator understood Miss Ts actual experience mightve been very different at the time.
Our investigator said that based on the level of income Miss T told NewDay she had, and the
relatively low credit limits offered on both cards, she was satisfied the checks that NewDay
carried out were reasonable and proportionate, and that its lending decisions were
responsible and affordable.
Miss T didnt agree. She said that at the time she took out the first card, she was in a deep
financial pit and although she kept up appearances, she had multiple payday loans, high
cost loans, credit cards and private loans from friends. Her monthly outgoings were always
bigger than her income. There were also multiple markers of late payments.
Miss T wanted an ombudsman to consider her complaint, so it was passed to me for a final
decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
When a lender decides whether to open a credit card account for someone, its able 
to take account of what they have told it, and what it can see on its credit bureau 
check. But checks on lending have to be proportionate. So that means if theres 
something in the information that doesnt seem to add up, a lender may well be 
expected to do further investigations, to check whether any lending is affordable for 
the applicant.
We know that NewDay did some checks that it has shown us. And on the first 
occasion it lent to Miss T, I dont think it found a cause for concern there. 
I know Miss T says she was in a very bad financial situation at the time. So Ive 
looked at her credit file closely for this time. 
The debt level she reported looks to me to be roughly consistent with what I can see 
there, from the relevant time.
I can see that there are some issues which might well mean that Miss T thinks 
NewDay was wrong to lend to her. And I accept what she says about her financial 
situation then being poor. But NewDay said it couldnt see evidence of this at the 
time. And I cant see that NewDay could have known this at the time it made its 
lending decision, in October 2016. 
I can see that Miss T missed a series of payments to a different credit card from 
October 2016 onwards, but credit files take some time to update, so I wouldnt expect 
this to be visible to NewDay at the time her application was made. It also appears 
that this card was over its limit, and had been for some time. But the credit file that 
Miss T sent us suggests that this lender hadnt reported problems with this lending to 
credit reference agencies, so NewDay wouldnt have known about this.
Similarly, Miss Ts short term lending does seem to have increased around this time, 
but NewDay has shown us the report it got at the time didnt tell it about Miss Ts 
short term lending. In my experience, payday lending often didnt show in full on a 
lenders credit checks at that time. And of course, NewDay wouldnt know about 
private lending, when Miss T borrowed from friends.So it doesnt look like NewDay was aware of the full extent of Miss Ts borrowing at 
the time that it opened her first credit card account. But I dont think that was 
NewDays fault. And I dont think that further enquiries would have revealed these 
issues at the time, simply because of the amount of time it takes for a credit file to 
update. So I dont think NewDay made a mistake when it opened the first card 
account for Miss T.
Ive also looked at the information that NewDay had available to it when Miss T 
applied for her second card. And I think that the second time NewDay lent to Miss T, 
some things that she told it didnt add up. So I think NewDay shouldve done more 
then to check that its lending would be affordable for Miss T.
At that time, Miss T apparently declared unsecured debts of £5,800. But other 
internal data held by NewDay suggests that it should have been aware that her debt 
was almost twice this amount at that time. I think that calls into question the lending 
decision NewDay made then.
Because I think NewDay shouldve realised that Miss T had greatly under-reported 
her other lending, I think NewDay shouldve looked more closely at Miss Ts financial 
situation then. If it had done so, it may have found that the credit card which was over 
its limit in 2016 was still over its limit some years later. And shed missed seven 
payments onto that card in the last two years.
I think NewDay ought also to have realised that if Miss T had so seriously 
underestimated her debts, she may also not have provided robust figures for her 
income and expenditure.
NewDay didnt do these additional checks. So it cant be sure that its lending to Miss 
T on this second card was responsible and affordable for her. For that reason, I think 
NewDay should refund onto Miss Ts second card, any interest and fees that she was 
charged for this lending while the card was open, and it should not charge interest 
going forward. I dont expect that there will be a surplus, but if there is, NewDay 
should pay that to Miss T, with 8% simple interest.
And because I dont think this lending should have been made, Ill also ask NewDay 
to remove any adverse information on this second credit card from Miss Ts credit 
file.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss T accepted my provisional decision. She wanted us to note that at the time the second 
card was issued to her by NewDay, it had also recognised she was in persistent debt with it 
on her first card, and it had been writing to her to tell her this. Miss T said she had now 
managed to get out of persistent debt on the first card, but that only happened after this 
second card was issued. 
So Miss T said NewDay didnt have to look as far as external credit scoring companies to 
see clearly what her financial situation was. It had already categorised her as "in persistent debt" and had told her about this in writing. Miss T said that also called into question the 
lending decision on her second card.
NewDay also replied. It didnt agree with my provisional decision.
NewDay said that Id expressed doubts about its lending on the second card, because Miss 
T had declared unsecured debts of £5,800, but other data held by NewDay said that she had 
total debts of almost twice this. NewDay said that, although it considered the unsecured debt 
amount Miss T provided on her application, it also took into account the information about 
Miss Ts debt level reported by the credit reference agency, before making the decision to 
accept Miss Ts application. 
NewDay said it gave Miss T a credit limit of £500 on this second card. Based on the 
assumption that she used the full amount of the credit limit of £500 immediately, her monthly 
minimum repayments would have been £17.62. NewDay said its data showed that from May 
to December 2020, Miss T paid well in excess of this amount every month, sometimes four 
times the amount needed. So NewDay said it couldnt agree that repayments were not 
affordable for Miss T. 
NewDay wanted me to reconsider.
I recognise that this is an unusual case, because although Miss Ts credit file shows 
extended periods of missed payments and extensive short term lending, the file Ive seen 
doesnt yet show defaults. However, I dont think that this means that the lending NewDay 
made, on its second card, was in fact affordable for Miss T. 
When NewDay made that lending decision, for the second card, it was required to assess 
Miss Ts capacity to pay back the money it was offering to lend her. I dont think NewDay has 
shown that it made a robust decision at this point. In particular, I remain of the view that the 
fact that Miss T had greatly under-reported her existing debts ought to have made NewDay 
question the other things shed told it too, and look more closely at her position before it 
decided to lend to her. It doesnt look as if NewDay did that.
But what NewDay appears to be saying now is that there wasnt actually a problem with this 
lending in practice, because Miss T didnt have any difficulties with it. NewDay says that 
must be right, because Miss T was making her payments, and often more than the minimum.
I dont think this follows. When NewDay makes lending like this, its only supposed to go 
ahead if it thinks Miss T could repay the lending in a sustainable fashion. And that doesnt 
just mean servicing the debt. So its about more than just paying the interest, or covering 
purchases made to keep the card within its limits. 
Sustainable means paying back all of the amount borrowed, within a reasonable time, and 
without needing to borrow elsewhere to do that. So if NewDay wanted to say that this 
lending had worked out ok, even though its decision may not have been robust, I think it 
would need to show me that Miss T was paying back the money she borrowed, and reducing 
her debt, without borrowing elsewhere.
Thats not what happened here. Whilst Miss T has made repayments to her second card, the 
card has also been used in almost every month since it was taken out. The information 
NewDay has sent isnt entirely clear on this, but it appears that Miss T spent up to the limit 
by around the time of her first statement. It is clear that she has remained around her credit 
limit since. And NewDay has told us she was charged for exceeding the limit in August and 
October. I dont think that this evidences that Miss T has been able to pay back the principal amount 
that she borrowed, in a sustainable fashion. And for that reason, I havent changed my mind 
about the appropriate outcome in this case. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd should refund onto Miss Ts second card, any interest 
and fees that she has been charged for this lending, and it should not charge interest on this 
card going forward. If there is any surplus, NewDay Ltd should pay that to Miss T, with 8% 
simple interest. NewDay Ltd should also remove any adverse information on this second 
credit card from Miss Ts credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 November 2021.
