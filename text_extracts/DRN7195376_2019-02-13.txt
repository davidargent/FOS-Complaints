K820x#14complaint
Mr Ws complaint  is about his mortgage account  with National Westminster Bank Plc. He is 
unhappy that NatWest has refused his request for further borrowing and that his wife hasnt 
been added  to the mortgage account.
background
In February 2005  Mr W took out a mortgage  with NatWest. He borrowed about £37,000. In 
September 2005 he borrowed  a further  £19,000. 
Unfortunately, over the years the account has been in arrears. There have been a number of 
payment arrangements  agreed, most  of which were broken. But the arrears have never been 
large enough for NatWest to want to take any possession action. 
Mr W lives in the property with his wife, Mrs W, and their children. In February 2017 Mr Ws 
solicitors wrote to NatWest asking that Mrs W be added to the mortgage  account and for the 
bank to carry out a valuation.  NatWest  explained that an application would need to be made 
for a transfer of title, and that a valuation could be requested  as part of this. . 
But in May 2017 the solicitors wrote to say that the application wasnt  proceeding, but that 
Mr W wanted a valuation.  A cheque for £150  was enclosed. As there was no application with 
NatWest, it applied the £150 to the mortgage account.
In February 2018  Mr W asked NatWest for a further advance  of £10,000. This was declined,  
due to credit  scoring.  Mr W was unhappy  about this and complained. NatWest didnt uphold 
the complaint,  so Mr W brought it to us.
An investigator looked at the complaint, but didnt think  it should  be upheld.  Mr W asked for 
an ombudsman to review  the case. He said that his solicitors had told him that no completed  
transfer application was sent to them by NatWest because the bank said that he and Mrs W 
would need to make an application. Mr W says that he and Mrs W went  through  20-minute 
interviews each with NatWest and that the account was put into joint names.
Mr W also says that the £150 was paid to NatWest for administrative fees for processing the 
application, yet it hasnt done  so.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I have some  
disappointing news for Mr W  Im not upholding the complaint. These are my reasons.
transfer of title: Ive looked at the letters about this. These are as follows:
10 April 2017  Mr W writes to NatWest asking  for his wife to be put onto the 
mortgage account. He also asks that a valuation be carried out to ensure  that 
NatWest holds data on the true property  value .
20 April 2017  NatWest replies to say:  Before we can consider the request to add 
[Mrs W] onto the mortgage and title deeds,  a Transfer  of Title application is needed. 
Ref: DRN71953762Please contact us on the number above  for an initial discussion. We believe a 
valuation can be requested also as part of this application.
We charge an administrative fee of £150.00  for processing an application. Also, we 
will have to ask you to instruct a solicitor or licensed  conveyancer  to act for you and 
to change the Land Registry title details. The costs for this are not covered by us.
2 May 2017  Mr Ws solicitors write to NatWest: Our client  advised  that he no 
longer wishes his wifes name to be added on the property. However, our clients 
wishs the property to be evaluated and we enclose an administration fee of £150.00, 
please contact  our client to arrange  a evaluation. (sic)
NatWest has no record of any application,  either  in writing or on the phone, by Mr and Mrs W 
for her to be added to the mortgage. Its clear from the correspondence  that in May 2017 
Mr W had instructed his solicitors that he no longer  wished to go ahead with this.
NatWest doesnt  offer a stand-alone valuation service; any valuation would be part of an 
application for borrowing or, as NatWest explained  on 20 April 2017, in the course of the 
application to change the parties, if requested. NatWest also didnt say that the valuation  fee 
would be £150.  And theres no requirement for NatWest to update  its valuation  from time to 
time if there  is no application for a variation  to the mortgage contract.
When NatWest receive the cheque  for £150, it credited it to the mortgage  account. I think, 
given what the solicitors letter said, that the bank could have explained that it wasnt able to 
carry out a valuation in isolation. But as the £150 has been used towards  the mortgage 
account, I dont  consider  theres been any detriment to Mr W.
Mr W insisted  to our investigator that he had confirmation from NatWest  of the mortgage 
account being put into joint names. He provided  statements from NatWest. But these  were  
for a current  account, not the mortgage account.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied there  was no application to transfer the mortgage into joint 
names.  Im not upholding this part of the complaint.
further advance: The starting  point  is that NatWest is under no obligation to offer further  
borrowing to Mr W, and he is not entitled to a further  advance as of right.
In February 2018  Mr W wanted to borrow some more money from NatWest. Ive listened to 
his phone call with NatWest. The bank explained that the minimum amount its able to lend 
as a further advance on a mortgage is £10,000. After going through Mr Ws financial 
circumstances, the application  was declined  on the basis of credit  scoring  and affordability.  
Mr W explained that Mrs W earned a good salary,  but NatWest clarified that, as she isnt on 
the mortgage account, her income  couldnt  be included  when calculating  affordability. 
Im satisfied NatWest took into consideration all the information Mr W provided about his 
circumstances. Having  done so, NatWest was entitled to decline the request for further 
borrowing. I dont have  any power to order NatWest to offer a further  advance  to Mr W, or 
tell it that it must take Mrs Ws income into consideration.  
I appreciate it was disappointing  for Mr W to be declined the loan, but it was a decision 
NatWest was legitimately entitled to make.  In the circumstances, Im not upholding this part 
of the complaint.
Ref: DRN71953763other matters: In his initial complaint Mr W was unhappy that Mrs W's name  had been  
removed from a joint current  account.  This isnt something I can consider here. If Mrs W is 
unhappy that her name has been  removed  from an account, she will need  to bring her own 
separate complaint about it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2019.
