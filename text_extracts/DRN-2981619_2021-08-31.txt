The complaint
P complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs decision to place a limitation on its 
account following a review and withholding its money.
Mr W brings the complaint on Ps behalf.
What happened
P opened an account with PayPal to allow it to take payments from its customers. During the 
pandemic, P offered its customers virtual consultations and allowed them to make payments 
through PayPal to avoid any face to face contact.
In April 2020, PayPal reviewed Ps account. Following the review, PayPal placed a 
permanent limitation on Ps account and advised P that its actions were a violation of 
PayPals acceptable use policy. P disagreed. PayPal asked P to send them certificates 
proving Ps eligibility to perform its business. P sent PayPal the required information, but the 
limitation remained.
Funds were left in Ps account when PayPal made the decision to permanently limit access. 
PayPal held these funds under their terms policy for over 180 days. PayPal have since 
released the money back to P.
P thinks PayPal have misinterpreted the acceptable use policy and made a discriminatory 
decision based on the nationality of Ps staff.
Our investigator reviewed things and didnt uphold Ps complaint. She said PayPal were 
entitled to review and close Ps account. And she found PayPal were entitled to hold on to 
the money for the time they did. Our investigator also said she hadnt seen any evidence of 
discrimination behind PayPals decision.
P disagreed. It didnt agree that PayPal were entitled to close the account for the reasons 
they had  as it didnt agree it had breached PayPals policy. It asked for an ombudsman to 
review things.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat evidence from 
banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains information about 
other customers, security information or commercially sensitive information. Some of the 
information PayPal has provided is information that we considered should be kept 
confidential.
Like our investigator, Im satisfied that PayPal were entitled to review Ps account and 
subsequently close it. The user agreement which P would have agreed to when it opened its 
account with PayPal sets out the terms under which PayPal operates the account. Our 
investigator helpfully pointed out the term where it allows PayPal to close the account 
immediately in some circumstances. The term explains that PayPal can close an account at 
any time if;
You are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close 
your account under this user agreement.
I recognise P doesnt accept it breached PayPals policy  but Im satisfied based on the 
evidence Ive received that PayPals actions were fair. Ultimately, PayPal reviewed the use 
of Ps account and identified an issue with the use of it so made the decision to permanently 
limit the use of the account. PayPal provided P with an explanation for their actions, and 
while I appreciate P doesnt necessarily agree with the reasons, I cant fairly uphold Ps 
complaint on that point. This service wont generally intervene in a banks commercial 
discretion. PayPal exercised their right to no longer offer P facilities and I've seen nothing to 
suggest that theyve made an unfair decision. So, I cant fairly ask them to do anything 
differently. 
PayPals user agreement also states that PayPal can Block your PayPal account and/or 
hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if 
so required by PayPal, where PayPal's rights arise from your engagement in the restricted 
activity).. Based on this, while I appreciate the inconvenience and disruption caused to P 
by PayPal holding on to its funds, I cant reasonably say they did anything wrong. Im 
pleased PayPal have since released the money to P as they should have.
Ive thought carefully about what Mr W has said relating to PayPal making a discriminatory 
decision based on the nationality of Ps staff. This is a serious allegation to make. Ive 
reviewed all of the evidence and arguments Ive received but Ive seen nothing to suggest 
PayPals decision is linked to Ps staffs nationalities. 
So  while I appreciate that P will be disappointed by my decision, I wont be asking PayPal 
to do anymore here.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2021.
