DRN-2237085
The complaint
Miss O complains about end of contract charges when her agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services UK Limited ended. Shes also unhappy about excess mileage charges.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I didnt propose to uphold this complaint. In 
summary, I said there wasnt enough evidence to persuade me that the salesman made a 
misrepresentation about the return standards in relation to the alloy wheels. I also said that I 
was satisfied that alloy wheel insurance was offered to Miss O and that she made the 
decision to decline it. I explained why I thought the damage to the alloy wheels exceeded fair 
wear and tear in accordance with the relevant guidelines. 
In relation to excess mileage charges, I said the mileage allowance was clearly shown on 
the finance agreement and I thought Miss O ought reasonably to have been aware of the 
allowance. I said I wasnt persuaded that the mileage limit was misrepresented to Miss O.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss O responded to my provisional decision and said she didnt want to pursue her 
complaint further. MBFS didnt reply to my provisional decision. In the circumstances, and for 
the reasons Ive set out  as well as those set out more fully in my provisional decision - I 
see no reason to reach a different conclusion to my provisional decision. 
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
