The complaint
Miss S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, provided credit to her which she feels 
was unaffordable for her. 
What happened
In March 2017, Miss S applied for a credit account with NewDay. Her application was 
accepted, and NewDay issued Miss S with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £900.
In November 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Ss account to £1,900. Further 
credit limit increases followed in January, April, and September 2019, to £2,800, £4,400, and 
£5,450 respectively.
In 2021, Miss S raised a complaint with NewDay because she felt that credit the NewDay 
had given her hadnt been affordable for her, and that NewDay should have recognised this, 
had they undertaken checks into her financial position before offering the credit to her.
NewDay looked at Miss Ss complaint. They noted that they had undertaken checks into 
Miss Ss financial position before offering credit to her, and they felt that there hadnt been 
anything resulting from these checks which should have given them any reasonable cause 
to suspect that Miss S might not be able to afford the credit being offered to her. So, 
NewDay didnt uphold Miss Ss complaint.
Miss S wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the information that 
NewDay had obtained from Miss S at the time of the credit account application in November 
2017 was such that NewDay shouldnt have approved Miss Ss application at that time. 
Because of this, our investigator recommended that this complaint be upheld in Miss Ss 
favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay feel that they did that here. At the time of the credit account application in 2017 they 
took details from Miss S of her income and level of existing indebtedness to check that she 
would in all likelihood be reasonably able to afford the monthly repayments that might 
become due on the account as well as obtained information about Miss S from a credit 
reference agency in order to get a better understanding of Miss Ss wider financial position. 
And NewDay contend that there was nothing resulting from these checks which they feel 
should have given them cause to suspect that Miss S might not be able to afford the new 
credit account she was applying for.
However, its notable from the information that NewDay gathered from Miss S that she 
declared that she was housewife/homemaker with an annual income of £4,200. Additionally, 
Miss S also declared at that time that she had existing unsecured debt totalling £10,100.
This means that at the time of the account application, Miss Ss level of already existing debt 
was approximately two and a half times her annual income. And, given that Miss Ss 
personal annual income was relatively low, at only £4,200, its unclear how much of that 
annual income was disposable  meaning that its difficult not to conclude that Miss S would 
have most likely struggled to repay her existing debt, before the NewDay application, in 
anything less than a timeframe of several years.
This level of existing debt doesnt seem sustainable to me, and consequently it doesnt seem 
fair or reasonable that NewDay would provide any new credit to Miss S at that time, which 
would potentially facilitate Miss S falling even further into what Im satisfied was already an 
unsustainable level of debt.
NewDay may contend that as part of the application process Miss S indicated that another 
member of her household had income of £15,000, which NewDay took into account when 
assessing the affordability of Miss S and which meant that the provision of a further £900 
credit to Miss S wasnt done so irresponsibly.
But Miss S was applying for a credit account in her name solely, and so its difficult to 
understand why the income of another household member (presumably a spouse or partner) 
would be taken into account, especially when its considered that theres no ongoing 
guarantee that the other household member in question would consent to their income being 
used to repay Miss Ss own credit commitments, or that the other household member would 
remain in such a relationship with Miss S moving forwards. 
Even discarding these important points, it doesnt appear that NewDay undertook any 
checks into the financial situation of the other household member to determine that persons 
level of existing debt and existing credit commitments so as to ascertain whether any portion 
of the £15,000 annual income of the other household member as declared by Miss S was 
realistically disposable or available for Miss Ss potential credit repayments.
Additionally, it also appears that NewDay didnt obtain accurate information about Miss S 
from the credit reference agency before approving Miss Ss application and issuing the credit 
account to her. I say this because the affordability assessment information that NewDay 
have provided to this service lists Miss Ss existing credit debt balance and number of 
existing payday loans as both being zero at the point of application, only to increase to 
£10,200 and ten respectively the following month.
Given that Miss S had declared to NewDay that her existing level of debt as being £10,100, 
and has confirmed to this service that she was using a large number of payday loans at that 
time, I feel that its more likely than not, on balance, that Miss S had such a level of 
outstanding existing debt and existing payday loans at that time of the account application, 
but that this wasnt assessed by NewDay because they didnt obtain accurate information at 
that time. And this scenario seems considerably more plausible to me that the alternative, which was that Miss S acquired over £10,000 of debt and opened ten payday loans in the 
month immediately after the opening of the NewDay account.
Furthermore, had NewDays assessment of Miss Ss application included that Miss S had 
ten existing payday loans, as Im satisfied that it should have done, its very difficult to 
conclude that NewDay should then have reasonably approved Miss Ss credit account 
application, and this is even if NewDay assessed Miss Ss available annual income to 
include the £15,000 other household members income as they did but which as explained I 
feel they shouldnt have done.
All of which means Im satisfied that the information that NewDay both gathered and should 
have gathered about Miss S at the point of the account application was such that NewDay 
shouldnt have reasonably provided any further credit to Miss S at that time. And it follows 
from this that I dont feel that NewDay provided this credit to Miss S fairly or responsibly and 
that I will be upholding this complaint in Miss Ss favour on that basis as a result.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Miss Ss account all interest, fees, and charges, incurred or 
accrued on the account from the point of account opening in March 2017.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Miss Ss favour, this balance must be 
paid to Miss S along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of payment.
If after the reimbursements a balance remains outstanding on the account for Miss S to pay, 
NewDay must arrange an affordable, interest free repayment plan on that balance with   
Miss S.
Finally, NewDay must remove any and all adverse reporting relating to this account from 
Miss Ss credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, on the 
basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 May 2022.
