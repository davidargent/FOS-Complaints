The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) S. r.l. & Cie, S.C.A. blocked his account and wont 
return his funds for 180 days.
What happened
PayPal sent a text to Mr S about his account. He thought it was a scam so he didnt do 
anything about it. PayPal blocked his account and Mr S wasnt able to withdraw his funds. 
He complained to PayPal. It apologised for the inconvenience but explained that its decision 
to close his account was in line with the user agreement.
PayPal said it had decided to limit Mr Ss account following a review of his account activity. 
PayPal explained in its final response letter to him that it believed the account presented a 
risk and in the circumstances it was entitled to close the account.
PayPal also said that in line with the terms of the account, it was holding onto the funds for 
up to 180 days from the last completed payment. Mr S would be able to withdraw his 
remaining funds after that time. PayPal referred Mr S to the user agreement which sets out 
the action it can take when it suspects restricted activities are being carried out. Mr S was 
unhappy with its response and brought the complaint to our service. 
Our investigator didnt uphold his complaint. He thought that PayPal had done enough to 
explain in its final response letter why it had closed Mr Ss account and why it was holding 
the funds for 180 days. He also felt that it had acted in line with the user agreement.
Mr S remained unhappy. He said he didnt know why PayPal closed his account and he 
wanted to withdraw his funds.
The complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I sympathise with Mr S and I realise this will disappoint him, Ive decided not to 
uphold his complaint. Ill explain why.
There are two key issues to Mr Ss complaint  PayPals decision to close his account 
without explaining why, and its decision to hold the funds in reserve. Ive looked at its final 
response to his complaint and I see that PayPal directed Mr S to the relevant parts of the 
user agreement which it relied upon when deciding to close his account. Simply put, the 
relevant sections are:
Section 9.1 - a detailed list of restricted activities which a user must not do.Section 10.2 - actions that PayPal may take to protect itself and other parties from 
financial risk if it suspects restricted activities on an account.
 
I can see that PayPal explained to Mr S that it reviewed his account and believed there had 
been restricted activity which presented an excessive risk. Because of this it decided to 
close his account. Ive seen the information PayPal provided in confidence and upon which it 
relied when reaching its decision, and Im satisfied its described in the list of restricted 
activities. Closing an account is one of the actions it can take to protect against liability:
10.2 Actions by PayPal. If we have reason to believe that you have engaged in any 
Restricted Activities, we may take various actions to protect PayPal, a User, a third party, or 
you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The 
actions we may take include but are not limited to the following: 
a. We may, at any time and without liability, suspend, block, limit, close or cancel your right 
to use your Payment Instrument or Account entirely or for any particular transaction, which 
may in turn suspend, block, limit, close or cancel access to your Account or the Services
I am satisfied that PayPals letter explained to Mr S that it closed his account to protect 
against risk in line with the user agreement, and that it directed him to the relevant part to 
confirm it was entitled to do so.
PayPal told Mr S that it was holding his funds for 180 days, after which he could withdraw 
any remaining funds. I understand that Mr S felt worried because he couldnt access his 
funds and that it may have caused him upset and financial difficulty at the time. However, I 
dont think that PayPal acted unreasonably by blocking his access to the funds. The user 
agreement describes this as one of the actions it can take to protect against financial risk:
10.2 Actions by PayPal.
[we may] b. Block your Account and/or hold any funds in the Reserve Account (including, 
without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPals rights 
under section 10.2 arise from your engagement in the Restricted Activity set out in section 
9.1 ag.)
I am satisfied that the user agreement makes it clear what would happen in the event of 
restricted activities on the account; that PayPal was entitled to hold Mr Ss funds for 180 
days in line with the user agreement, and that it explained this to him. Ive now seen 
evidence that, on reaching the 180 days deadline, PayPal released Mr Ss funds and he 
withdrew the balance. PayPal has done what it said it would do in line with the user 
agreement. 
In summary, I think PayPal told Mr S what it was doing with his account and why. I dont 
think it treated Mr S unfairly or needed to do any more.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2020.
