K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  findings  on this complaint on 3 March  2020. A copy of my 
provisional decision is attached and forms part of this final decision. 
I explained why I intended to uphold  this complaint in part and I asked Mr H and Sunny to let 
me know if they had anything to add. Neither  Mr H nor Sunny has sent me anything  else to 
consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr H nor Sunny sent me anything else to consider, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional findings. So my final decision  is the same as my provisional  decision, for the 
same reasons.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 11 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 11 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 11 to 22 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. Elevate Credit  International Limited must put things right by 
taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2020.

complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit  International  Limited,  trading  as Sunny,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had 22 loans with Sunny, as Ive summarised  in the appendix to this decision. Our adjudicator 
considered the complaint  and recommended  it be upheld in part. He didnt think Sunny shouldve 
provided loans 5 to 22 to Mr H.
Sunny didnt  agree with the adjudicator.  It said that by loan 5, Mr H had only been borrowing  from it 
for six months, which it thought  was too soon to say he had become  dependant on using its 
product. It also thought that the size of the loans (and Mr Hs repayments) and some  of the gaps 
between the loans demonstrated that many of the earlier loans were  sustainably  affordable for Mr H. 
It did agree, however, to partially  uphold Mr Hs complaint  in respect of loans 15 to 22.
Mr H didnt accept Sunnys  offer. As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to 
decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr H 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN49317863Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Like the adjudicator, I dont have any significant concerns  about  Sunnys  decision to approve the 
flexible credit  facility (loan 1), the drawdowns  from that facility, or the first three instalment  loans (2 to 
4).
Mr Hs running  credit  account had a limit of £750. Mr H made drawdowns up to this limit but went on 
to repay the whole balance within three months  albeit at around the time I believe Sunny withdrew  
this product. I dont think the number of drawdowns or overall amount borrowed, suggests any real 
problems with the sustainability of loan 1. Similarly,  I dont  think the amounts Mr H borrowed for loans 
2 to 4, even taking into account that they overlapped, suggests they were likely to be unaffordable for 
him, based on his declared income  and expenditure and the pattern  of lending  up March 2015.
Ive next focused on loans 5 to 14, as these are the loans still in dispute. I dont think by 
May 2015 the pattern of lending alone shows that further lending was likely to be unsustainable  for 
Mr H. I say this because the amounts Mr H borrowed from Sunny  in May 2015 was less than hed 
borrowed in March  2015. And there was no increase in the amount he borrowed in June 2015  or in 
August 2015,  when Mr H borrowed less, only £50. So there  were some indications Mr Hs use of 
short-term credit was reducing by August  2015.
However, Mr H had been borrowing from Sunny  for around seven months by loan 5. Although there 
were some gaps  between the loans, I still find this is a long period of time to be regularly accessing 
high-cost short-term credit. I would  therefore have expected Sunny to carry out more  thorough 
affordability checks from this point, in order to check whether the loans really were  sustainably  
affordable, as its income and expenditure checks had suggested. So for loan 5 to 10, Id have 
expected to see Sunny carrying out a thorough assessment of Mr Hs income and expenditure, 
including asking Mr H for some further proof of what he had declared. Ive not seen any evidence 
Sunny did anything like this  but equally, I havent seen any evidence from Mr H (such  as bank 
statements) to show that these loans were  unaffordable.  Im therefore  not planning  to uphold  the 
complaint about loans 5 to 10 as theres not enough evidence to suggest  they were not affordable for 
Mr H.
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans.
I dont agree with Sunny  that this point became apparent by loan 15. I think this point was clear earlier 
than this. Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 11. 
I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mr H was not managing  to repay his loans  
sustainably. Mr H had been indebted to Sunny for almost  a year, having taken  out 10 loans 
(in addition to the drawdowns on loan 1) in that time. So Sunny  ought to have realised it was 
more likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN49317864Mr Hs first instalment loan was for £150 and loan 11 was for the same amount. Mr H also 
borrowed significantly more  in September 2015 than he had in the previous month. So Sunny 
ought to have known  that Mr H was not likely  borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 22 was taken out 
two years after Mr Hs first loan.  And it was for the same amount as 
Mr Hs first instalment loan. Mr H had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think  that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide  borrowing from loan 11 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Mr H borrowed  was likely to have had 
negative implications  on his ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market 
for these  high-cost loans.
So Im planning to uphold the complaint  about loans 11 to 22 (which includes the eight loans Sunny 
have already agreed to uphold).
putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans  11 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 11 onwards means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 11 to 22 should be removed  from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.

Loan no. 1 was a running account (open-ended) credit agreement. This allowed Mr H to make 
drawdowns up to his limit of £750 and repay what he owed in five payments. Sunny has provided 
information showing Mr H made nine drawdowns  totalling £989.29 between October and December 
2014. Loans 2-22 were  instalment loans.
