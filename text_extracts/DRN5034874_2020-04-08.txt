K822xcomplaint
Mrs B complains about issues shes experienced with a car supplied with finance from FCA 
Automotive Services UK Ltd.
background 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I proposed  to uphold Mrs Bs complaint and to 
require FCA to reimburse Mrs B for the sums  shes paid to voluntary terminate the 
agreement and pay her £150 compensation.
Both Mrs B and FCA said they agreed with my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties  have accepted my provisional decision. So I see no reason to reach different 
conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional  decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint. FCA Automotive Services Ltd should:
Reimburse Mrs B the sums shes paid to voluntary  terminate the agreement  being 
£310.32 shortfall and £139 collection fee.
Pay compensation of £150 for distress  and inconvenience
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.
