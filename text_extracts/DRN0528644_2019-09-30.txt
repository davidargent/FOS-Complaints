Mr S is unhappy with the increases in premiums on his home insurance with 
St Andrews  Insurance Plc (Lloyds).  
background 
Mr Ss insurance policy started  in 2003 and cost £595.31 for the year.  For 2014  the renewal 
quote was £1,948.69. Mr S called mid-term in November 2014 to discuss  his premium  and 
he arranged for the policy  to be amended   updating some elements of the cover. This 
increased the premium  by £84.25.  And a discount  of £162.75 was applied  to the policy  on 
the same  day. Mr Ss policy was cancelled in December 2014.  
Mr S thinks  Lloyds  has taken advantage  of him by unfairly increasing  the cost of the policy  
every year. He says he was charged  too much and he should be reimbursed £10,000 plus 
compensation for the extra he had paid over the years.  
Lloyds offered to refund  some  of the cost of the insurance for the 2009  premium onward. It 
offered £2,898.28 as a refund of some  of the premiums and 8% additional compensation for 
Mr S being  out of pocket of that money. Lloyds  has also offered a further £200 as 
compensation for the trouble and upset  Mr S has been caused.  Our adjudicator  thought the 
offer was a fair way to resolve things.
Mr S disagreed and didnt  think the offer was fair. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont have the power to tell a business  what its insurance should  have  cost.  I would be, in 
effect determining  or telling a business how it should  operate  and thats not my role. But I 
can look at whether Lloyds has treated Mr S fairly  throughout the period he held his 
insurance policy. 
If I find that Lloyds hasnt treated Mr S fairly, I will look to see what  compensation would be 
fair and in this case whether I think Lloyds offer is fair.
When Mr S took out his policy  in 2003,  it cost £595.31 for the year. Often new policies will 
have introductory  discounts. This isnt uncommon and policies may well initially be priced 
lower to attract new customers. I dont think its unfair for an insurer to seek to recoup that 
cost over the first few years. 
I can see that Mr Ss premium continued  to increase each year and he didnt engage  with 
Lloyds about his premium until 2014.   
Mr S says he assumed  he was paying competitively priced premiums for his home  
insurance. It was only after he retired that he started  looking closer into his insurance 
premiums. And it wasnt until November 2014 that he called to discuss  his premium and the 
cost was challenged. His policy was cancelled  shortly  after this in December 2014. 
Ref: DRN05286442If Lloyds should  have realised Mr S wasnt the type of person who shopped  around  for 
cheaper insurance regularly, and it increased  the price  just because he didnt engage at 
renewal, that wouldnt be fair.
Lloyds has offered to keep Mr Ss premiums from 2009 at the same  amount he was charged 
in 2008  so £1,007.18. So it will refund the difference on the payments he made on his 
premiums from 2009 until 2014  when the policy was cancelled. For example, Mr Ss 
premium in 2009 was £1,153.60. Lloyds has offered to refund the difference  between the 
2009 and 2008 premiums,  plus interest. And its done this for every  yearly premium after 
2008. Lloyds  total offer is £2,898.28 plus interest of 8% for the time he was out of pocket.  
Mr S says he was overcharged for most of the time he held his policy, and is therefore owed 
a lot more than this in compensation.  In particular he has pointed to the cost of the cover he 
was able to secure  with another insurer in 2014.  Ive thought  about  this. But these policies 
would not have been identical and so cant be compared like for like. Along with a difference  
in premium, there may have been differences in cover and difference excesses. I must also 
take into account that as this was a new policy  being set up in 2014  Mr S probably  received 
a discount on the premium  cost as well. So it wouldnt  be fair for Lloyds  to use this different 
policy cost when working out its offer.  
Having considered Lloyds offer, I think its fair. It makes sure Mr S hasnt lost out if Lloyds 
did increase the price  just because he didnt engage  at each renewal
I also think Lloyds additional  compensation offer of £200, that it made  later on for the trouble 
caused to Mr S, is fair.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, St Andrew's Insurance Plcs offer to refund some of the costs  
of Mr Ss policy from 2009 is fair.
St Andrews  Insurance Plcs additional  compensation offer of £200  for the trouble caused to 
Mr S is also fair. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 October  2019.
