The complaint
Mr H complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) hasnt provided a refund for an 
item Mr H bought online but then returned to the seller.
What happened
On 12 November 2020 Mr H paid for an item hed bought online using PayPal. When he 
received the item, Mr H thought it was too small and contacted the seller. Mr H says he sent 
the item back to the seller by recorded delivery in January 2021. And in February 2021 the 
seller agreed to refund Mr H. But Mr H says the seller stopped responding, leaving him out 
of pocket.
Mr H contacted PayPal in March 2021 and it opened a refund claim. PayPal closed the claim 
when Mr H didnt provide the supporting information it asked for. When Mr H did then 
provide that information, PayPal told Mr H it had declined his claim because it didnt consider 
the item to be significantly not as described if it was materially similar to the sellers 
description. Then a few days later, PayPal told Mr H it declined his claim because the 
PayPal Buyers Protection scheme covers goods or services not delivered or not as 
described. 
Mr H complained to PayPal but it didnt change its position. So Mr H brought his complaint to 
our service, saying he used PayPal as hed thought hed be protected, as PayPal advertised. 
And that ultimately, he didnt have the item hed paid for. 
Our investigator asked Mr H and PayPal for more information. Mr H explained hed had 
difficulties with PayPals website when trying to upload the supporting information it asked 
for. PayPal said Mr H contacted it several months after he bought the item, and while it 
initially closed the claim, it reopened it after Mr H explained his uploading difficulties and 
provided supporting information. But that after considering Mr Hs claim, PayPal declined it 
because the recorded delivery tracking number Mr H provided was invalid. 
Our investigator told PayPal shed checked the recorded delivery tracking number and it was 
valid. PayPal agreed but said that wasnt why it declined the claim  it said it declined the 
claim because Mr H hadnt explained why the item was significantly not as described, in line 
with PayPals user agreement.
Ultimately, our investigator said Mr H tried resolving things with the seller first. And she was 
persuaded Mr H had difficulties uploading supporting information to PayPal. She said the 
tracking number was valid and PayPal now had the information it had asked Mr H for. So 
she thought a fair outcome was for PayPal to reassess Mr Hs claim, and if it thought a claim 
still wasnt payable, it should clearly explain the reason why to Mr H.
Mr H accepted our investigators view. But PayPal asked for this complaint to be referred for 
an ombudsmans decision, as it thought it had acted in line with its processes and user 
agreement - PayPal said to be eligible for its Buyer Protection, customers must respond to 
its requests for information within the time requested, and not afterwards. 
This complaint came to me for a decision and I contacted Mr H and PayPal to share my 
thoughts informally. I said that based on the evidence provided so far, I thought the reasons 
PayPal gave for declining the claim werent fair or reasonable, and this would have caused 
Mr H some frustration which I thought PayPal should pay him £100 compensation for. I also 
said PayPal should reassess Mr Hs claim and if it still thought his claim wasnt payable, it 
should clearly explain the reasons why to Mr H.
Mr H thanked me but didnt provide any further comments or evidence. 
PayPal did provide further comments and evidence. It said Mr Hs recorded delivery tracking 
wasnt valid because it showed an item was delivered on 6 January 2021, but Mr H didnt 
open a PayPal dispute until 21 March 2021 - PayPal said Mr H hadnt followed its user 
agreement and highlighted the opening a dispute section. And PayPal said it didnt have 
evidence showing what item was returned to the seller or that the seller had received it. 
PayPal also questioned why the seller hadnt refunded Mr H when they said they would. 
When I asked PayPal to clarify some of its comments, PayPal said it had acted in line with 
its user agreement. And confirmed that if Mr H had opened a PayPal dispute in 
January 2021, PayPal would have refunded Mr H even without the seller confirming theyd 
received the returned item. But PayPal said Mr H returned an item without PayPals 
involvement, which isnt in line with PayPals user agreement. So it cant pay Mr Hs claim.  
 
Im now in a position to make my decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal has given several reasons for why it has declined Mr Hs claim. 
It said it initially closed the claim because Mr H didnt provide supporting information within 
the timescale it gave him. I can see that Step 3 of the online dispute resolution process 
within PayPals user agreement says PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party 
evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies. You must respond to 
these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you. 
But Ive seen PayPal only gave Mr H three days to provide them, which I think is an 
unreasonably short time. And Im persuaded Mr H had difficulty uploading the information to 
PayPals website, because this is something Mr H has consistently told both PayPal and our 
service. I know PayPal says Mr H should have provided this information within the 
timescales it gave him and not later, and that its followed its processes and terms. But Im 
satisfied its not fair for PayPal to decline Mr Hs claim simply because he provided 
supporting information after an unreasonably short timescale.
PayPal has also said it declined the claim because Mr Hs recorded delivery tracking number 
was invalid. Ive checked the tracking number and I can see it is valid and shows an item 
was delivered on 6 January 2021. Regardless, it seems PayPal is suggesting the tracking is 
invalid because it shows there was a delay between Mr H returning the item in January 2021 
and opening a PayPal dispute in March 2021. PayPal has highlighted the opening a dispute 
section of its user agreement. And said Mr H returned an item without PayPals involvement, 
which isnt in line with PayPals user agreement, so it cant pay Mr Hs claim. 
Ive set out the sections of the user agreement PayPal has highlighted. They say:Our online dispute resolution process
If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow 
our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under 
PayPal Buyer Protection. You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and 
speaking to an agent. The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not 
follow these steps your claim may be denied:
Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the payment. This might allow 
you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that 
may help resolve the dispute. If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, 
proceed to Step 2. We will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's 
PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed. And it goes on to outline further 
steps.
The first sentence says customers can open a dispute with PayPal if theyre unable to 
resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller. So I think its unreasonable for 
PayPal to decline Mr Hs claim because he returned the item without PayPals involvement, 
as the user agreement suggests this is something Mr H can do. And I think its also 
unreasonable for PayPal to decline Mr Hs claim because of a delay between him retuning 
the item and him opening a PayPal dispute, as PayPal has suggested. Because the opening 
a dispute section of the user agreement PayPal has highlighted says Mr H should open a 
dispute within 180 days of the date he made the payment. And Im satisfied Mr H did open a 
dispute within 180 days, because he paid for the item on 12 November 2020 and he opened 
a PayPal dispute on 21 March 2021. 
PayPal has also given Mr H other reasons for declining his claim. It emailed Mr H in 
April 2021 to say it had declined his claim because it didnt consider an item to be 
significantly not as described if it was materially similar to the sellers description. And a few 
days later, PayPal emailed Mr H to say it had declined his claim because the PayPal Buyers 
Protection scheme covers goods or services not delivered or not as described.
But Mr H is unhappy because he has paid for an item he ultimately now doesnt have. And it 
seems PayPal has questions about exactly what item was returned to the seller and why the 
seller didnt issue a refund. And for the reasons Ive already explained, Im satisfied the 
reasons PayPal has so far given for declining Mr Hs claim are not fair and reasonable.
Given this uncertainty and confusion, I think a fair and reasonable outcome here is for 
PayPal to reassess Mr Hs claim - and if PayPal thinks the claim isnt payable after 
reassessing it, PayPal should clearly explain why to Mr H. 
And I think PayPal would have caused Mr H some frustration by so far declining his claim for 
what Im satisfied are not fair and reasonable reasons. I think £100 is fair compensation for 
that frustration, so PayPal should pay this to Mr H.  
Putting things right
I think a fair and reasonable outcome here is for PayPal to reassess Mr Hs claim - and if 
PayPal thinks the claim isnt payable after reassessing it, PayPal should clearly explain why 
to Mr H. And for PayPal to pay £100 compensation to Mr H.
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
should:
reassess Mr Hs claim for a refund. And if it thinks a claim still isnt payable after that 
reassessment, PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should clearly explain the reasons 
why to Mr H
pay Mr H £100 compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
