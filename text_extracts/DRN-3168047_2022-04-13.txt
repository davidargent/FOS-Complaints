The complaint 
Mr R and Miss S complain that HSBC UK Bank Plc trading as first direct (first direct) were 
slow to process their mortgage application.
What happened
Mr R and Miss S had a mortgage with first direct. They wanted to move to a new house and 
needed to borrow another £100,000, resulting in total borrowing of £341,500. On 13 July 
2020, first direct sent an Agreement in Principle (AIP) for £341,000. On 27 August 2020, first 
direct sent to Mr R and Miss S a link to upload the necessary documents to support the 
application. Following receipt of these, a mortgage appointment took place on 17 September 
2020, and a mortgage illustration was sent out the same day. On 30 September 2020, a 
mortgage offer was sent to Mr R and Miss S for a mortgage of £341,500. This included the 
new mortgage of £100,000 at a fixed rate of 1.94%, fixed for five years. The booking fee was 
£495. But, on 11 September 2020, first direct had changed their fixed rates. The previous 
five-year fixed rate was 1.69%, with a booking fee of £495.
Mr R and Miss S complained. They said the delays in processing their mortgage application 
werent acceptable. They said first direct didnt need to ask for Miss S bank statements - 
and as a result, they now had to pay a higher interest rate than they should have. They said 
this cost at least £600 a year.  They asked for the refund of the booking fee of £495.
First direct said the AIP sent on 13 July 2020 was subject to the receipt of supporting 
documents, and on 1 September 2020, they received a copy of Mr Rs payslip and bank 
statement. On 3 September 2020, they received payslips for Miss S, together with a letter 
from her employers confirming her salary. On 9 September 2020, they contacted Mr R and 
Miss S to confirm the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on their situation. But this was a 
mistake  as theyd already received confirmation of Miss S post-pandemic salary. The 
mortgage was agreed by first directs underwriters on 9 September 2020. A mortgage 
appointment was made for 14 October 2020, but this was then brought forward to 17 
September 2020. First direct said it was unfortunate that the interest rate had increased, but 
their rates can change at any time. They apologised for the error in relation to the documents 
they requested regarding the pandemic, and paid compensation of £100 for that.
Mr R and Miss S brought their complaint to us. Our investigator looked at what happened 
between the AIP on 13 July 2020 and the mortgage appointment on 17 September 2020. He 
couldnt see why the link for Mr R and Miss S to upload the documents wasnt sent to them 
earlier than it was. If it had been, then it was possible that the mortgage appointment 
couldve taken place earlier. But also, interest rates fluctuate  so they couldve gone down 
as well as up. Overall, he thought first direct did cause a delay, but he couldnt be certain as 
to the impact of that  they may have been able to get an earlier appointment and they 
couldve got  a lower rate, but he couldnt be sure. He thought that first direct should pay a 
further £200 compensation.
First direct agreed with this, but Mr R and Miss S didnt - and asked that their complaint be 
looked at by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of this complaint is  why was there a delay between the issue of the AIP on 13 
July 2020 and the mortgage appointment on 17 September 2020; and did this cause the 
higher fixed rate to be applied to Mr R and Miss S mortgage.
There was a long period between the AIP on 13 July 2020 and when the link was sent to ask 
for the uploading of documents on 27 August 2020  so Ive firstly looked at what happened 
during that period. 
Period between 13 July 2020 and 27 August 2020: First direct told us they sent a link to Mr 
R and Miss S when they issued the AIP on 13 July 2020  but I couldnt see any evidence in 
their records of this. So, I looked into this further. I listened to the call between Mr R and first 
direct on 13 July 2020. This was an initial call  whereby an assessment of affordability was 
carried out. Based on what Mr R told first direct, they issued an AIP for £341,000. Mr R and 
Miss S hadnt sold their house at that time, nor found a new property.  On the call, first 
directs rep said she would sent the AIP to Mr R, together with a link for him to upload his 
documents (payslips etc)  but she told him not to send anything in until theyd found a new 
property. She said that even if they did, the documents wouldnt be looked at - as until theyd 
found a new house, nothing could be progressed anyway. Mr R showed us the AIP 
document  and the email from first direct includes the link. But given what first direct told Mr 
R on the call, I dont think any documents were then uploaded. And even if they had been, I 
wouldnt have expected first direct to have progressed the mortgage at that stage  because 
there wasnt a mortgage application to consider. 
Mr R then called first direct on 27 July 2020 and I listened to that call also. Mr R was asking 
about how to calculate the new mortgage based on several scenarios, including the 
possibility of porting the existing mortgage and having the Early Repayment Charge 
refunded. Mr R stated that they hadnt found a new property. First directs call hander told Mr 
that once theyd found a new property  then the supporting documents could be uploaded; 
and an appointment then arranged with a mortgage advisor. Mr R accepted that  he didnt, 
for example, say that hed sent in the documents already. So  again, because a new house 
hadnt been found, I wouldnt have expected first direct to have progressed the mortgage 
any further at this stage.
Mr R called first direct again on 27 August 2020. He advised them that theyd found a new 
property and their offer had been accepted. First directs call handler told Mr R that an 
appointment with a mortgage adviser would then be arranged. Mr R asked how he could 
send in supporting documents such as payslips  and first direct said theyd send him the 
link to upload them. Ive seen in first directs records that they sent the link on 27 August 
2020. So  it doesnt appear that Mr R had sent in any documents before that time. First 
direct couldnt have been expected to have progressed anything until 27 August 2020  not 
least, because the amount of the mortgage wasnt known until a new property had been 
found.
Period between 27 August 2020 and 9 September 2020: after 27 August 2020, I can see 
that the documents were provided quickly. By 7 September 2020  all the necessary 
documents had been received by first direct. I can see that first directs underwriters raised a 
question about the Miss S bank statements, and this was resolved by 9 September 2020. 
They then asked another question about whether Mr R and Miss S salaries were affected by 
reduced hours due to the pandemic  but this was an error, because theyd already had 
confirmation of the post-pandemic salaries. First direct apologised for that and paid compensation of £100. But also  this was resolved on the same day - 9 September 2020. I 
think the questions asked by first direct about the documents at this time were valid and 
were those wed normally see  confirmation of salaries, employment details and conduct of 
the bank accounts. And  for this to be completed in just under two weeks was reasonable. 
On 9 September 2020, first directs underwriters approved the mortgage.
Period between 9 September 2020 and 17 September 2020: Mr R and Miss S have said that 
it then took too long to arrange a mortgage appointment after that. They were offered a date 
of 10 October 2020  which was a long way away, but first direct brought that forward to 17 
September 2020. So  that was within eight days of the underwriters approval  which I 
think was reasonable. On that day, the mortgage illustration was sent out, and the mortgage 
offer was sent on 30 September 2020. 
And so  I think what happened in the period between 27 August 2020 to 17 September 
2020, and the checks that took place  all look reasonable. It was during that time that first 
directs rates went up  on 11 September 2020. 
I accept that Mr R and Miss S were disappointed to learn that the interest rate increased  
but market rates do move, and we cant hold first direct responsible for that.  And based on 
what Ive seen, I dont think first direct caused unreasonable delays in the processing of Mr 
R and Miss S mortgage - which might have led to them paying a higher interest rate.
Our investigator felt that first direct should pay additional compensation of £200. That was 
because there were some small delays. As Ive said, I dont think these were excessive to 
the extent that they caused a higher interest rate to be paid. But equally, I can see that these 
caused some frustration and therefore I agree that a payment of £200 is appropriate for that.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. HSBC UK Bank Plc  trading as first direct must:
Pay compensation of £200 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R and Miss S 
to accept or reject my decision before 10 May 2022.
