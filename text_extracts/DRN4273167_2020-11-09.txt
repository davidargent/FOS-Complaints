K821x#15Complaint
Miss O complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie SCA are holding her liable for a debt of 
£498 which she says isnt hers. She wants PayPal  to stop pursuing her for this debt.
Background
Miss O has said that in May 2018  she received a letter from PayPal telling her she owed  
money-
She says she never set up a PayPal account.  She called PayPal and was told the bill related 
to a mobile phone  purchase which she knew nothing about. Miss O cancelled  her card but 
didnt go to the police.
PayPal have said that according  to their records Miss O set up an account with them on 
30 January 2015.  On 24 September 2017  a PayPal  credit account was opened  in Miss Os 
name. 
Two other PayPal accounts were opened on the same day using different customer names  
but the same email  address,  phone number and home address as those  registered  under 
Miss Os PayPal  account.
Miss O has told us she lives with her family  and has had the same phone  number  for over 
10 years  and has lived at the same  address  for nine years. 
PayPal say that on 20 February  2018 Miss O paid £498.00 to purchase a mobile phone  
using her PayPal credit.  The payment  was for a used mobile phone.  The item was shipped 
to the address that PayPal have  for Miss O. 
PayPal say that Miss O filed a claim on 27 February  2018 with them because the item was 
damaged, and she had returned it to the seller. PayPal declined  this claim.
Miss O says in May 2018 she received a letter from PayPal requesting payment for the 
£498.00 credit. She contacted PayPal to find out more.  She told PayPal she didnt have any 
knowledge of a PayPal account  and she hadnt  bought a mobile phone so she shouldnt  be 
held liable  for the debt. PayPal declined this claim. 
PayPal have said that as Miss O already  told them that she had sent payment to the seller  in 
February they didnt  think this was a case of unauthorised use of her account.
Miss O was unhappy with PayPal holding her liable for the debt, so she complained  to our 
service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and said that she thought  it likely that Miss O 
didnt know the account existed so PayPal should cancel the debt. 
PayPal disagreed with the view. 
As there was no agreement the matter has come  to me to decide.
Ref: DRN42731672My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have reached the same conclusion as 
the investigator for broadly  the same reasons.
Generally, PayPal can hold Miss O liable for the debt if she applied  for the credit herself or 
authorised someone  else to do it on her behalf.
So, I need to think about whether the evidence suggests its more  likely than not Miss O 
applied for the credit  or consented for the application to be made and should therefore be 
held liable  for the debt.
I can see that its possible for a fraudster  to have applied for the credit using Miss Os details 
as no ID verification was carried out. The fraudster would only need  the name and address 
as well as the email address used on the PayPal account in order to apply  for the credit. 
These details would be available to others especially to someone close to Miss O. 
Ive seen a copy  of the credit application  form. It has Miss Os correct name and address. 
The form has been signed electronically in Miss Os name. The email  address used is not 
the one we hold for Miss O. She has told us she doesnt have other  email  addresses. So, I 
can see how its possible that someone  got her details  and applied  for the credit pretending 
to be her. I think its PayPals responsibility to do enough checks  to satisfy themselves that 
the person applying for credit is who they say they are. 
Miss O has given  a plausible explanation that she didnt open  the PayPal account or take out 
the credit  agreement.
So, on balance from what Ive seen,  I dont think its reasonable for PayPal to conclude 
Miss O made the application herself.  I say this because:
The PayPal account opened in her name  doesnt use the email  address and contact 
number we hold for Miss O. 
Miss O has confirmed  to us she has had the same email address and phone  number 
for over 10 years.
The type of transactions on the account  are not ones  I would  expect Miss O to make. 
They are for purchases of mobile  phones and she has told us she is under contract 
for a mobile phone, which is the phone she uses to communicate with us.
The bank  account linked to Miss Os PayPal  account belongs to a family member  I 
will refer to as L.
Two further PayPal  accounts were opened at the time the credit  was applied for. All 
these used the same phone number, email address  and home address as are 
registered under Miss Os account.  This suggests all accounts were  created by the 
same person.
The transaction log provided by PayPal shows that the transactions havent  been 
made using Miss Os name but when a customer name has been used its been Ls 
name.
Ref: DRN42731673L opened their PayPal account  on 8 November 2017, that account  uses  the same 
phone number, address and uses the same device to access PayPal as does the 
account in Miss Os name. This suggests  they were  opened  and are operated  by the 
same person. I am satisfied from this evidence  that either Miss O or L operate  both 
accounts. I think it more likely  that L opened both accounts instead  of Miss O given 
what she has told us about  herself.
I have also considered whether Miss O consented  for the application  for the PayPal credit  to 
be made on her behalf. I have looked  at the evidence and I consider that Miss O is genuine 
in not knowing  that a PayPal account  had been  opened in her name or that a PayPal credit 
agreement had been applied for using her details.
It follows that I dont think PayPal should hold her liable for the debt. 
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold  this complaint and I direct PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Cancel Miss Os debt together with any interest  that has accrued. 
Correct the credit  file in Miss Os name to reflect this.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 December  2020.
