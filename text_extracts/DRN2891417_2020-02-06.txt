K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that loans  he had from Emergency  Cash Limited (trading as wizzcash.com) 
were unaffordable.
background
Mr S had three instalment loans from Wizzcash  between April 2015  and June 2015  as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly  
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 30 Apr 2015 £300 3m £138.75 20 Jul 2015 21 May 2015
2 27 May 2015 £400 3m £189.05 20 Aug 2015 1 Jun 2015
3 10 Jun 2015 £500 12m £75.11 20 May 2016 21 Oct 2015
Mr S says Wizzcash didnt carry out enough checks before lending him money. He says he 
was already struggling to repay  other debts, had a gambling addiction and was suffering with 
his mental health.
Wizzcash says it asked  Mr S about  his income and expenditure  and verified  the income 
information it was given. It says it also checked  Mr Ss credit  file and found nothing  in the 
available information  to indicate  the loans were unaffordable. Wizzcash adds that Mr S had 
no problems repaying  the loans and all the instalments were on time.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He said proportionate 
checks for loan 3 were  likely to have  shown Mr S was having trouble managing his money 
as he had other short-term loans  outstanding.  He recommended  that interest  and charges 
on loan 3 (plus 8% statutory interest) should be refunded to Mr S and that any associated 
negative information  should be removed from his credit file.
Wizzcash responded  to say, in summary,  that it spoke to Mr S before it approved loan 3 and 
it factored in the loan payments Mr S declared. It says this still left Mr S with almost  £500 
each month  and all the loans  were  repaid early.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Wizzcash was required to lend responsibly.  It should  have  made checks to make sure Mr S 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr S was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Wizzcash  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied that Wizzcash did enough checks before it approved  these loans. Mr S told 
Wizzcash his income was £1,589 and his expenditure  was under £800 per month.  Based  on 
Mr Ss disposable income,  and the information Wizzcash  had from his credit file, I consider it 
was reasonable  for both loans to have been approved.

Mr S repaid  loan 2 very quickly, but days later he applied for a bigger loan. As this was his 
third loan in quick  succession,  and he was requesting a much longer  repayment term, I 
consider proportionate  checks should have included verifying the information Mr S had 
provided and asking him specifically whether he had any other short-term loans. I cant see it 
did this, so Ive looked  at Mr Ss bank statements to see what  such a check  is likely to have 
shown.
I can see Mr S had at least three  outstanding short-term loans at the time, so Wizzcash  
should have realised this was an indication  he was having problems managing  his money.  In 
addition to this, Mr Ss income  was actually around £500 lower  than the amount hed 
declared. Based on the expenditure figures Mr S had given Wizzcash, this actually  left Mr S 
no disposable income with which to pay additional  loans.
So, I find that Mr Ss financial circumstances showed it was unlikely hed be able to 
sustainably repay  loan 3 and Wizzcash  shouldnt have approved it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Emergency Cash  Limited (trading as 
wizzcash.com) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr S paid on loan 3;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Ss credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Wizzcash  to take off tax from this interest. Wizzcash 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2020.
