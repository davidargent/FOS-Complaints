The complaint
 Mr J complains that NewDay Ltd has refused to lower the interest rate on his credit card 
following a letter it sent him concerning persistent debt. 
What happened
Mr J opened his credit card account with NewDay in June 2016.
In May 2020 NewDay wrote to Mr J to explain it had noticed over the previous 18 months he 
had paid more in interest fees and charges than he had repaid towards the amount he 
borrowed. This letter was sent further to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules requiring 
firms to support customers whose accounts are in persistent debt. 
NewDay suggested Mr J make boosted payments to bring the debt down further. It 
explained that it would monitor his credit card account and take action required by the FCA 
should Mr J continue to be in persistent debt. Mr J requested that NewDay reduce his 
interest rate. NewDay said it would not do this as interest rates are based on his 
circumstances. Mr J complained to NewDay. 
In its final decision NewDay said it had acted in line with FCA rules, that by asking Mr J to 
make higher repayments he would be charged less interest. It also said it is not required to 
reduce Mr Js interest rate because he asked it to. 
Mr J was not satisfied with this response and brought his complaint to this service. He said 
he had been paying £10 to £15 more than the minimum payment but not the £80 or so that 
NewDay was suggesting.  He said hed told NewDay it could help him bring the balance 
down by reducing the interest rate, but it wouldnt do that. 
Our investigator said NewDay had done what it should do when it identifies a customer is in 
persistent debt. She concluded that NewDay isnt obliged to reduce the interest rate on the 
account as per its terms and conditions. But following information provided by NewDay and 
Mr J she concluded that credit limit increases provided by NewDay were unaffordable and 
recommended it refund all the interest and charges applied to Mr Js account from 1 June 
2018. 
NewDay didnt agree with this view and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman. It 
provided several comments to which I have responded below. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I shall be upholding this complaint for the following reasons. 
Ive read the terms and conditions of the account. It states NewDay may change interest 
rates if it reasonably thinks that a customers credit risk profile has changed - meaning that 
there is an increased risk that the customer might not be able to repay it. But it isnt obliged 
to reduce interest rates on request from a customer.
Ive also looked at NewDays responsibilities concerning customers in persistent debt and 
Im satisfied it did what it should have by communicating to Mr J about his situation and 
possible boosted payments. 
In response to our investigator Mr J has told this service hes been trying to pay more than 
the minimum payment, but he cant afford to. He said hes been on sick income for about six 
years, since prior to the credit card application. Mr J said his repayments were manageable 
until the last credit limit increase. This increase brought his minimum payments to about £80 
but NewDay suggested he pay £180 which he said he couldnt afford. He told us there had 
been no major changes to his income. 
It does appear that at some point Mr Js credit card debt was or may have become 
unaffordable to the point where he is only able to make the minimum payments and unable 
to get out of persistent debt. In line with our approach, Ive looked at whether NewDay 
completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr J would be able to 
repay the debt in a sustainable way.
Ive examined Mr Js credit card statements from September 2017 and bank statements 
along with information relating to credit limit increases provided by NewDay. NewDay raised 
Mr Js limit to £400 in March 2017. I can see in September and October Mr J exceeded and 
then was close to the limit of £400. NewDay raised the limit again in October to £1,000. Mr J 
utilised this additional credit almost straight away. From December to May 2018 he was 
close to the £1,000 limit. NewDay raised the limit in June to £1,800. In July and August Mr J 
again used the additional credit close to the limit. NewDay raised the limit further in 
September to £2,600. Mr J utilised the additional credit and in December and January 2019 
he exceeded his limit. Throughout this period Mr J paid a little more than the minimum 
payment. In February NewDay raised the limit to £3,200 and Mr J made a balance transfer 
payment of £872. Up until March 2020 he has kept to a balance of around £2,000 making 
payments just above the minimum.   
It appears that each time Mr J had a limit increase he was fully utilising his credit. While he 
was consistently making over-payments, they were only small amounts above the minimum 
and not enough to bring the debt down sustainably. Im persuaded that the limit increases in 
June 2018, September 2018 and February 2019 were unaffordable. 
NewDay said it reviewed Mr Js account and his external financial behaviour on a regular 
basis. It said prior to September 2018, he had incurred no late, over limit or cash advance 
fees, or any external accounts in arrears. It went on to say that when his limit was increased 
in February 2019, he again had no late fees or cash advance fees within the previous 6 
months and just two over limit fees of £12.00 each. Im not disputing NewDay performed 
these checks, but this does not necessarily mean the limits were affordable. 
Mr Js credit limits went from £1,000 to £3,200 in a seven-month period, the last of which 
was immediately after two months of over limit fees. NewDay said Mr J met its lending 
criteria. It said although he had incurred over limit fees in December 2018 and January 2019, 
this was not necessarily an indicator of financial difficulty, but rather poor account 
management. And as no further fees of any kind were incurred on Mr Js credit card and as 
he was still making his contractual minimum payments, he was managing the account. Im 
not persuaded this was the case. I can see Mr J was making the minimum payments, even 
in December and January when he was over balance. But he almost always tried to overpay even if only by a few pounds and he made a balance transfer to a 0% interest card in 
February 2019, so Im satisfied this wasnt a case of poor account management. Im 
persuaded Mr J was trying to make an effort to pay down the debt, from £2,622 to £1,858 
just as NewDay was increasing the credit limit further to £3,200. 
NewDay said, like most other lenders, it makes the assessment based on the way the 
customer is managing their account with it and information that is available to it from credit 
reference agencies. It is incumbent on lenders to make reasonable and proportionate checks 
and those checks required for the initial small credit limit may not be enough to justify a 
much larger credit limit. Im persuaded that in June 2018, September 2018 and February 
2019 NewDay should have looked more closely at Mr Js circumstances given he was 
always at the limit of credit and not paying it down. And the credit limit increased quickly. Mr 
J said he had been on sick leave for the previous six years. I also note from his bank 
statements payments to two debt management companies, indicating possible debt 
management plans. Had NewDay done further checks e.g. income expenditure analysis, Im 
persuaded it would have realised Mr J was not in a financial position to repay what he was 
borrowing in a sustainable way.]
Putting things right
 
Mr J has had the benefit of using the funds, but I think it fair and reasonable for NewDay to 
refund all the interest and charges applied to Mr Js credit card account from 1 June 2018, to 
date. And apply it to the balance on the card.
Should Mr J continue to struggle to repay the debt he should contact NewDay and I would 
expect it to act positively and sympathetically towards him. 
My final decision
  My final decision is that NewDay Ltd should refund all the interest and charges applied to 
Mr Js credit card account from 1 June 2018 to June 2021 and apply it to the balance of the 
card
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2021.
