K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that Nationwide Building  Society  hasnt paid the correct amount of interest  
on his ISA.
background
Mr M complains that Nationwide has miscalculated the interest due on his ISA. Hes 
received interest  of £1708.80 but thinks he should  have received £1747.41. In its final 
response Nationwide sent Mr M a breakdown  of how interest  has been calculated.  It says it 
has paid the correct amount. Mr M doesnt  agree and he wants Nationwide  to pay the 
difference. He provided his own calculation of what he thought  the interest should be.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said Nationwide  had calculated the interest 
correctly. Mr M didnt  agree so Ive been asked  to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the breakdown of how interest has been calculated as provided  by Nationwide.  
Ive also looked  at Mr Ms calculation. And Ive taken account  of Nationwides interest  on 
savings guide.
Looking at all of the information  it seems  to me that Mr M has made a small error in his 
calculations in relation to the number of days. This error accounts  for the difference  between 
the interest paid by Nationwide and the interest  Mr M thinks he should have received.
Based on the information provided Im satisfied that Nationwide  has paid interest correctly.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 October  2019.
