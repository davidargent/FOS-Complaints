K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs G complain that National  Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) has reported 
adverse information  about their mortgage to credit reference agencies  in relation to a missed 
payment. They  say this only came  about  because of problems switching their scheduled 
repayment date and NatWests poor customer service after they questioned this. 
background
Mr and Mrs G have a mortgage  with NatWest. From  June 2017 their contractual repayments 
were to be made on the fifteenth of each  month.
After Mrs G changed job, and the date she was to be paid her salary changed, she and Mr G 
decided to change  the date of the contractual monthly repayment to the first of each  month. 
Mr and Mrs G say they first attempted to do this through online banking  at the end of June 
2018. NatWest doesnt  have record of them requesting a change  at that time.
On 15 July 2018 NatWest attempted to claim the contractual monthly repayment by direct 
debit. This was returned unpaid by Mrs Gs bank. NatWest says it wrote to Mr and Mrs G 
confirming the payment  had been missed  and that it would try to take it again within  14 days.
On 16 July 2018 Mrs G requested the repayment  date on the mortgage be changed  to the 
first of the month. She says she did this after noticing the payment on 15 July being claimed 
and returned.  She says she assumed  this was an error by NatWest as she had already 
requested the payment date change. So she logged in and requested  the date change again  
 to be sure it was actioned. The change went through and NatWest  sent a confirmation 
message to Mr and Mrs G.
On 30 July 2018 NatWest tried again  to claim the payment that hadnt  gone through on 15 
July by direct debit. This was again returned unpaid by Mrs Gs bank.
On 1 August  2018 a contractual repayment was made by direct debit. 
NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs G later in August 2018 saying that a payment had been 
missed on their mortgage and asked  them  to get in touch to discuss  how this would be 
repaid. After speaking with NatWest about this Mr and Mrs G raised a complaint  as they felt 
it was being unhelpful. They thought that it was unfair to record this payment as missed with 
credit reference agencies as it had come  about as a result of changing their payment date 
online and NatWest had given no warning that this could happen. The missed payment was 
eventually made  up in November 2018.
NatWest said it didnt  think  it had done  anything wrong. It said it didnt have a record  of the 
request to change the payment date in June 2018. But in any event a payment was required 
each month. And one had not been made  for July 2018 so it was right to record the account  
as being a month in arrears until this was made  up. Unhappy  with this response,  Mr and 
Mrs G asked our service  to consider the complaint. 
An investigator looked into their complaint. Having done so she didnt think NatWest  was 
wrong to report the payment as having been  missed   as one was not made for July 2018. 
And she didnt think this was NatWests  fault as it had tried to claim the repayment but this 
had been unsuccessful.
Ref: DRN76505172Mr and Mrs G asked for an ombudsman to review their complaint. In summary they felt that 
NatWest had a duty of care to them and that the information reported did not reflect what  
had happened  and was punitive.  They  also felt NatWest  had been  unclear about the missed 
payment when asked,  which caused  some of the delay in the payment being made up. As 
they didnt agree with the investigators findings,  the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has confirmed  that customers can request a change to their contractual  repayment 
date through online  banking  and has provided screenshots  of what  its customers  will see 
when making this change. Mr and Mrs G did this successfully  on 16 July 2018. And from 
August 2018 their payments  were taken on the first of the month. So their request seems to 
have been processed correctly and in a timely manner.
Mr and Mrs G have said they first attempted to make the change at the end of June 2018. 
NatWest doesnt  have a record of this initial attempt to make a change.  It isnt clear what  has 
happened. It might be that Mr and Mrs G attempted to make the change but for whatever 
reason this didnt  go through.  But as NatWest doesnt have a record of it, or informing Mr 
and Mrs G that the change had been  approved, Im satisfied it didnt go through.  Overall 
though I dont think this makes  a difference to their complaint as a whole.
The screenshots NatWest  has provided, that it says wouldve been  seen  by customers  when 
making a change to their repayment, include a line which explains we require one payment 
to be made  to your mortgage each calendar  month.  The terms and conditions of their 
mortgage also in my opinion make  it clear that payments are required monthly. So a 
payment would always have been  required in July 2018. If Mr and Mrs G had successfully 
changed their repayment  date at the end of June 2018, to be claimed  on the first of the 
month, then a payment wouldve been  required on 1 July 2018. But no payment debited their 
current account on that date. And I think this wouldve indicated  to them that the change  
hadnt gone through. 
Mr and Mrs G have said that when  they changed  the payment date in June 2018 the website 
said that the next payment would  be due on 1 August 2018. But this wouldnt have been 
consistent with everything  else theyd received from NatWest. And the screenshots it has 
provided indicate that the month isnt mentioned when  a change is made  just the day on 
which the payment  will be taken. So I think its unlikely that NatWest  told them in June 2018 
that a payment wouldnt be required  in July 2018.
NatWest tried to claim the July 2018  payment on the original payment due date,  the fifteenth. 
But this was returned unpaid by Mrs Gs bank. NatWest tried again on 30 July. But again 
Mrs Gs bank returned the direct debit  unpaid. Mrs G has provided her current  account  
statements and it seems  this happened because there were insufficient  funds in her account 
to make the payment. So I dont think these payments  not going through were due to an 
error by NatWest. The effect of these attempts being  unsuccessful was that no payment was 
made for July 2018. 
Ref: DRN76505173As no payment was made  in July 2018, I think NatWest was entitled to record  this payment 
as missed. Mr and Mrs G have said this isnt an accurate reflection of what  happened.  But 
as no payment was made in July, I disagree. 
Mr and Mrs G have also said that this has been reported incorrectly  as it shows on their 
credit report  for four months.  They said the payment made on 1 August 2018 addressed the 
arrears. But in August  2018 a further  payment  became due - so two were  owed.  The 
payment on 1 August 2018  meant one of these had been made. But the other remained 
outstanding at the end of the month  - so one payment was still missing.  The same  was true 
of September  and October 2018.  It was only in November 2018, when two payments were  
made to the account, that their mortgage  was back  up to date. So while  I know Mr and 
Mrs G feel strongly  about this, I think the information that NatWest has reported to credit  
reference agencies   that their mortgage  was one payment in arrears from July to October 
2018 - is correct.
Mr and Mrs G have said that if NatWest had been clearer  with them,  and provided better 
service, they couldve made  the payment up sooner than they did. 
NatWest has said it got in touch with Mr and Mrs G on the day the payment request  was 
rejected. But it hasnt been able to provide a copy of what  it sent. So I cant be certain this 
was sent or what the correspondence said. However I can see, from the copy letter  Mr and 
Mrs G provided,  that it wrote to them  on 22 August 2018. This letter confirmed that a monthly 
payment had not been made and asked Mr and Mrs G to get in touch with NatWest.  
NatWest has provided copies of its records which show it spoke to Mr and Mrs G on 8 and 
22 September 2018. I havent heard what was said in the calls. But Ive seen NatWests  
system notes. Mr and Mrs G have said that NatWest  were unhelpful and not interested in 
understanding how the situation had come  about  during these  calls.  The notes from NatWest  
seem to support  that Mr and Mrs G explained  they were unhappy with how the situation had 
come about.  But they also suggest  they were  made  aware that their mortgage was still in 
arrears and a repayment would  be needed to bring it up to date. 
NatWest sent Mr and Mrs G a response to their complaint on 25 September 2018. And this 
again asked them to get in touch to discuss repayment of the arrears.
I know Mr and Mrs G remained unhappy  with how the situation had come  about, and 
continued to dispute this with NatWest. But from what  Ive seen I think  NatWest  was clear 
with them  throughout that there  was an outstanding  repayment that needed to be made. So I 
dont think NatWest was responsible for that not being done earlier  and as a result I dont 
think I can reasonably ask it to amend the information it has reported to credit reference 
agencies.
my final decision
While Im sorry to disappoint Mr and Mrs G, for the reasons given above, I dont uphold  this 
complaint.
Ref: DRN76505174Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision  before  20 October  2019.
