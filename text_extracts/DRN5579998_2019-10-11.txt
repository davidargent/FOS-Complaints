Mr A complains that Gain Credit  LLC,  trading as Drafty, lent irresponsibly.
background
Drafty offered a credit  facility which commenced with a limit being determined and then the 
customer was able to draw down the amounts he or she requires. The credit was unsecured  
and had no fixed duration. 
Draftys records  show that Mr A applied  for £3,000. Mr A declared a monthly income of 
£2,600 with outgoings of £1,180. Gain Credit  says that it carried  out checks. The credit  limit 
for Mr A was arranged  to be £1,250  on 24 March  2016. Drafty explained to this service that:
 A credit  worthiness check was completed  and the third party credit reference  agency 
confirmed a rating which was satisfactory  for the account obligation
 We checked via a third party  source  the customer's other credit obligations at the time of 
his account approval  and these similarly  met all reasonable affordability criteria
 The customer's consumer credit debt to annualized income was 20.51%
Based on the above information we conclude that proper and proportionate affordability  
checks were conducted
The credit agreement set out the total cost of the credit based on some  assumptions to 
illustrate the likely  cost to Mr A. On the assumption  that Mr A drew down the full £1,250 on the 
first day and then repaid  it over 12 months  in equal  instalments  then the total amount payable 
would have been just under £1,689. This would  have equated to about  £140  a month.  
The arrangement did include  a Billing Cycle which meant that a statement was produced  
ten days before Mr As salary payment and it gave the minimum payment required for that 
cycle. It had to be the higher of certain calculations in the agreement at clause 6 which  
I have not set out here. 
A Continuous Payment  Authority was used to take the minimum payments on or near Mr As 
monthly salary date. Other ways of payment  were  made available.  
Mr A wrote to Gain Credit  by email on 9 May 2016  asking to extend my credit line to 
£2,500. Draftys  response was to say that he needed to have  established an account in 
good standing  and able to meet affordability  requirements before any increases  were likely. 
And he would  be given 30 days notice of any increase  in his limit.
Ref: DRN55799982I have used the monthly Drafty statements of account to set out a list of what  Mr A drew 
down during that year and what he repaid. Mr A has explained that in order to repay the full 
amount in May 2016 he borrowed that sum from a third party. This table is not a substitute 
for the actual statements  for calculating any redress.

The March  2017  statement was labelled Arrears and Mr As account was suspended. The 
balance in February 2017 was £1,319.86  and in March 2017 was £1,382.86. In April the 
balance was £1,452.61.  
Mr A refers  to his having a County Court Judgment  but I have not been sent anything to 
show me this was in place  at the time of lending or at all. . 
Correspondence between  Gain Credit and Mr A commenced in February 2018 and Mr A 
said: Simple checks would have shown numerous  pay day loans  and other outstanding 
credit on my credit history. I cannot believe that Drafty would go on a credit score  alone and 
not ask about  previous or current lending. The credit score  you stated you received when 
you did your checks was completely incorrect. My credit score has never been that high and 
believe this was grossly  overstated  so your company  could give me the loan which  I could 
not afford.
Ref: DRN55799983One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought that Draftys initial  approval  for 
the account in March  2016 was satisfactory. And that Drafty ought to have  realised that Mr A 
was struggling from November 2016 and so he thought that it should put things right from 
26 November 2016.
Drafty disagreed and made several points, some of which have been outlined  above and 
other ones  included:
it carried out monthly  credit searches  and noted that in the course  of the year his debt 
obligations reduced substantially;
it asked Mr A if his circumstances had changed around November 2016;
it said that if minimum  monthly  payments are made, a customer is legally allowed to 
access the full credit  line that has been  granted at any time.
The complaint remains unresolved so it has been passed to me for a decision.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the credit  was offered.
Before lending money to a consumer or approving a credit limit a lender should  take 
proportionate steps to understand whether  the consumer will be able to repay what  they are 
borrowing in a sustainable manner without it adversely  impacting  on their financial situation.  
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
I have seen a copy of Mr As personal credit file dated February 2018 which would cover  the 
period relevant for this complaint. I have  seen copies of his bank statements for this period. 
I need to explain  to Mr A that upon first approaching Drafty in March  2016 it would not be 
expected, and would not be proportionate, for Drafty to carry out a full and comprehensive 
financial review. Mr A was a new customer. And bearing in mind  the credit limit granted  and 
the monthly payments required to repay the facility  within a reasonable period, Drafty was 
entitled to rely on the information  given  to it which suggested that Mr A had enough 
disposable income to service a credit facility with a limit of £1,250. And it carried  out its own 
credit search. I do note that Mr A asked for £3,000 and this was not approved.
Having looked  at all that Mr A has given me and Draftys information and submissions then 
I think that the initial credit facility  approval  was carried  out after checks  I would consider to 
have been proportionate.  And the limit approved was likely to have appeared serviceable 
and able to be repaid  within a reasonable time.
Ref: DRN55799984Mr A has explained that he was able to repay the full amount in May 2016  because he 
borrowed the money to do it but a) Drafty would not know that nor be expected to know that; 
and b) such repayment  was not likely to have placed  Drafty on alert to any concerns about 
Mr As ability  to repay. 
After that, Drafty did have  to monitor Mr As account  and it has explained to us how it did 
that. And Ive taken  the time to set out a summary  of all of the Drafty Statements  in the table 
above to show  the pattern of drawdown  and repayment. 
Our adjudicator referred to the fact that Mr A asked for the limit to be increased. I have seen 
this email too and I think it was May 2016  (not September  2016) and so quite soon after the 
credit facility had been offered. As I have mentioned earlier, Draftys response  was to say 
that he needed to have  established an account in good standing  and able to meet  
affordability requirements before any increases were likely.  No increases in his limit were 
offered to Mr A.
I think that after several months it would have been apparent to Drafty that Mr A was not 
making any inroads  into the debt as he was almost always  repaying the minimum amount  
and then drawing  down to the maximum available to him. This to me gives the appearance 
that Mr A was borrowing to cover  the hole that making these payments was leaving in his 
finances. And as I have  seen Mr As personal credit file I can see that late 2016 Mr A was 
obtaining more  and more debt from a number of sources including  long term and short  term 
lenders, for large sums with substantial repayments due each month. These  showed  that 
other debt was increasing. And I think that by October or November 2016  Drafty was likely to 
have had enough information from its own research  and information to ask further questions.  
I refer to the Financial  Conduct Authority Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) chapter 6 
which addresses the expected Business Practices in relation to the monitoring of an 
account. One indication of a risk of a customer being in financial difficulties is where it seems  
that the customer is borrowing to repay borrowing. Drafty has explained that it carried out 
monthly credit searches and although I have  not seen those specific  results I have been able 
to see Mr As personal credit  file to give me an idea as to what his situation was like and 
therefore what likely would have  appeared on a business credit search. I can see that Drafty 
has said that those  credit searches for personal  credit files and those used by businesses  
may differ but I do not think that the difference was likely so great that the types of loans and 
short term loan debts  Mr A was getting into by the Autumn of 2016 would not register. 
Drafty has said that around November 2016  it asked  Mr A if anything had changed. This may 
have been prompted by something it had noticed or seen from monitoring the account, but 
I do not know what. But what I do think is that there were many  months  of relatively  
consistent drawdowns by Mr A to the maximum  available. In one month he did not 
drawdown the £62.50 and the next month he drew down double.  So there was no reduction 
in the overall balance  of the debt.  I would have expected more than an enquiry by Drafty to 
Mr A. If that was the extent of its additional  checks then I do not think they were enough. I do 
think that by November 2016 Mr As financial situation was such that more thorough  checks 
would have revealed it if they had been done by Drafty.
So I think that by continuing to offer the credit facility, Mr A was exposed  to additional 
interest charges.  Mr A was not coping with the account. And from the drawdown of 
26 November 2016 I think that Drafty should  put things right as follows:
calculate the amount of all interest  and charges Mr A paid from 26 November 2016;
Ref: DRN55799985write off any unpaid interest charged from that same date;
rework the sums paid such that from 26 November 2016 any amounts paid to the 
account are applied to the reduction of the principal;
arrange for any outstanding balance to be paid off by agreeing a mutually agreeable and 
affordable repayment plan.  As Mr A is currently in a Debt Management Plan so I would expect 
Drafty to take Mr As current situation  into account when setting  the repayment amounts;
once the debt has been  repaid  then amend the credit file to remove  any adverse 
payment information.
As I understand that the outstanding  balance is quite high then I do not think  any surplus is 
likely. If there is a surplus due to Mr A then this needs to be with the added  8% annual  
simple interest*.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Drafty to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr A 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint in part and direct  that Gain Credit LLC 
trading as Drafty do as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
