The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd has lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr B opened a credit card account with NewDay in 2017 (Card 1) with a credit limit of £450. 
The credit limit on this card was increased to £1,100 in June 2018 and then increased a 
further four times over the next few years. In February 2019 Mr B opened another credit card 
account with NewDay (Card 2). The initial credit limit on Card 2 was £900 and this was 
increased three times over the next year. In September 2019 Mr B was approved for a loan 
with NewDay for £7,500.
In 2021 Mr B complained to NewDay about the loan hed been given, He said it was mis-sold 
to him as he was not in the financial position to repay it.
NewDay looked at all the lending it had provided to Mr B. It felt that it had been appropriate 
to approve Mr B for Card 1 in 2017. But NewDay considered that the limit increase on 
Card 1 in June 2018 had not been appropriate in light of his circumstances at the time. 
NewDay also considered that it had not been appropriate to open Card 2 for Mr B in 
February 2019. So NewDay refunded to Mr B the interest and charges he had incurred as a 
result of the limit increases on Card 1, and all the interest and charges applied to Card 2. 
But NewDay did not agree that the loan Mr B took out in September 2019 was unsuitable. It 
considered that it had carried out appropriate checks when deciding to provide Mr B with this 
loan and that those checks had not given it any reason to think the loan might not be 
affordable. Mr B disagreed, so he referred his complaint to us.
One of our Investigators looked into Mr Bs concerns. They explained that, given what 
NewDay had already done regarding Card 1 and Card 2, they would be looking only at the 
initial decision to open Card 1 for Mr B and at the loan application in September 2009.  
The Investigator was satisfied the initial decision to give Mr B Card 1 in 2017 had been 
appropriate. But they didnt think NewDay had acted appropriately when agreeing to offer 
Mr B the loan in September 2019. In summary, they felt that NewDay had not done 
proportionate checks and, if it had, those checks would have suggested the loan was not 
affordable. NewDay disagreed, and so the complaint was passed to me.
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint on 5 December 2022 explaining why I did 
not think it should be upheld. NewDay agreed with my findings. Mr B responded to my 
decision but did not provide any additional evidence or make any specific arguments about 
why he disagreed with my findings. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I explained the following:
Lenders should carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any lending application. 
The level of those checks will vary depending on the type and amount of the lending. 
Looking at the decision to give Mr B Card 1 in 2017, Im satisfied that NewDay did carry out 
appropriate checks at that time. The initial limit on Card 1 was relatively low, and the data 
NewDay received at the time of the application indicated that Mr B was able to afford the 
credit limit hed been offered. That data also didnt suggest that Mr B was having any 
difficulty maintaining any other accounts he held or that he was overcommitted in terms of 
the debts he had with other parties. 
The first limit increase on Card 1 was in June 2018. And in the months preceding that limit 
increase Mr B had been using payday loans and appeared to be in arrears with other 
creditors. For these reasons NewDay has said that it feels it should not have increased 
Mr Bs credit limit at that time, and has refunded all interest and charges incurred as a result 
of this limit increase and any subsequent limit increases. Having looked at the data NewDay 
has provided, I can understand why it reached this conclusion, and agree that what it has 
already done regarding this account is fair.
In February 2019 Mr B opened Card 2. When applying for this card Mr B stated his income 
was only £142 per month  although he did note that he had access to his partners income. 
NewDays affordability data from this time also shows that Mr B had made use of payday 
loans only a few months previously. NewDay has said that it feels Card 2 was not suitable 
for Mr B given what he had told it about his circumstances on his application and the 
affordability data it had at the time, And once again I can understand why NewDay reached 
that conclusion and consider what it has already done regarding this account is fair.
But NewDays conclusions on Card 1 and Card 2 above dont automatically mean that any 
further lending like the loan here was unaffordable too. A loan is a different type of credit to a 
card and NewDay should have treated this application like any other  looking at the 
affordability of this in the same way as Ive explained above.
In September 2019 Mr B applied for a loan for £7,500 with NewDay. On his application for 
this loan he stated that his income was £2,000 per month and that he had only very limited 
outgoings, leaving him with over £1,400 every month of disposable income. Mr B has told us 
more recently that his income at the time was actually somewhere between £1,100 and 
£1,800 but that his outgoings were significant and left him with little, if any, disposable 
income each month.
In summary, NewDay says it based its lending decision on information from the credit 
reference agencies and not solely on the information Mr B gave it about his income and 
expenditure at the time. And NewDay says the information it received indicated that Mr B 
was able to afford the loan repayments. But given the size of the loan Mr B was applying for, 
Im not satisfied that the evidence weve seen shows NewDay did carry out thorough enough 
checks to ensure that the loan was affordable. Specifically, I cant see that NewDay took 
steps to verify the information Mr B had given it about his income and expenditure, and I 
think that would have been a sensible step to take given the size of the loan and the fact that 
the information Mr B had given about his outgoings seemed to be incomplete or inaccurate.
I must now consider whether if NewDay had done more checks, it would have changed its 
decision to lend to Mr B. So I have reviewed bank statements Mr B has provided from the 
months prior to him taking out the loan and have also looked in more detail at the information 
on his credit file and at the credit cards he already held with NewDay. I am not saying NewDay had to do exactly this, but it is one way for me to recreate what a fuller financial 
review would most likely have shown. 
And with what Ive seen so far, I dont think further verification of Mr Bs income and 
outgoings would have changed NewDays decision. I say this because the bank statements 
Mr B has provided, while they do show a slightly lower income than that detailed on the loan 
application, also dont clearly show any regular payments for bills or rent, suggesting that he 
did have limited outgoings. The statements provided do show, in July and August 2019, 
transfers to another account held in Mr Bs name. And its possible Mr B was paying for bills 
out of that other account. But weve asked for statements for that account from Mr B and he 
has not provided them. 
So I dont think I can safely say that the statements from the time of the loan application 
suggest that Mr Bs outgoings were as high as he has now told us they were. I also note that 
Mr B was maintaining his credit card accounts  and sometimes paying far above the 
minimum monthly repayments, and that his current account was operating in credit.
Mr B also had no adverse information recorded on his credit file at the time. He hadnt made 
use of payday loan companies for around ten months, and had no arrears with NewDay or 
with other lenders. So with all of this in mind, I dont think the overall picture regarding Mr Bs 
finances here would have suggested that Mr B would have struggled to repay the loan or 
caused NewDay any concern. 
Mr B was then able to maintain his loan payments for several years, and his credit file 
doesnt suggest hes had any other significant difficulties with managing his other accounts 
either. And this also suggests to me that the loan was affordable at the time it was given to 
Mr B. Mr B has said he used his credit cards to cover the repayments on his NewDay loan. 
But Ive looked at credit card statements for Card 1 and Card 2 for six months following the 
loan being opened and cant see any sign that he used those accounts to cover his loan 
payments. From Mr Bs credit file, I also cant see any signs of significant additional 
spending on his other credit cards in the months following him taking out the NewDay loan. 
So overall, this doesnt suggest that he was immediately struggling with the repayments.
I appreciate this will be very disappointing for Mr B, but with everything Ive seen Im not 
persuaded it was wrong for NewDay to lend to him at either the initial credit card application 
in 2017 or when he took out his loan in September 2019.
NewDay agreed with my findings. Its clear from Mr Bs response to my provisional decision 
that hes unhappy with my findings, but hes not made any specific arguments or provided 
any additional information or evidence, that would make me change my decision. So on that 
basis I remain satisfied that NewDay has treated Mr B fairly and I wont be asking it to do 
anything more.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
