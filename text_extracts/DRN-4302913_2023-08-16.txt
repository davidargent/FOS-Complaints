The complaint
Miss K complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA irresponsibly gave her a credit card 
she couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
In January 2018, Miss K applied for a credit card with PayPal. She was given an initial credit 
limit of £1,500. The credit limit was reduced to £1,400 in April 2020 and then increased to 
£1,450 a month later.
Miss K fell into financial difficulties and from PayPals contact notes it appears she told them 
she was no longer working from around October 2019. PayPal says the account was 
defaulted in January 2020.
Miss K complained to PayPal in 2022 to say that the credit card shouldnt have been granted 
to her as it was unaffordable from the outset. PayPal didnt uphold her complaint. It said it 
had carried out appropriate affordability checks which showed that she had adequate 
disposable income to afford the regular repayments.
I sent Miss K and PayPal my provisional decision on 4 August 2023. I explained why 
I thought the complaint should be upheld. I said:
Prior to granting credit PayPal were required to ensure Miss K could sustainably 
afford the regular repayments. There isnt a set list of checks it needed to complete, 
however, it needed to ensure that any checks it did were proportionate in the 
circumstances. What is considered proportionate will vary with each lending decision 
and will take account of things such as (but not limited to): the amount borrowed, the 
type of credit, the size of any regular repayment (for credit cards this includes the 
ability to repay the entire credit limit in a reasonable period of time), the cost of the 
credit and the consumers circumstances.
PayPal says that as part of the application it asked Miss K to declare her income and 
expenditure by selecting from pre-determined bands. For income, Miss K declared 
she was working part-time and earned between £501 and £1,000 per month. For 
expenditure, she declared between £0 and £500. PayPal says it estimated a mid-
range in each band (i.e. circa £750 monthly income and circa £250 monthly 
expenditure), leaving her with a monthly disposable income of £500. Miss K also 
declared she lived at home with her parents.
PayPal says that it also completed a credit check which it says raised no affordability 
concerns, although it hasnt provided us with specific data its checks revealed, such 
as how many accounts she had and their respective repayment history (it has only 
given us various scores this data produced which it says demonstrate there were no 
issues). 
PayPal considers its checks were sufficient. However, in the circumstances of this 
case, I dont agree.
I say this because the rules stated that when assessing income and expenditure it 
was generally not sufficient for PayPal to rely solely on Miss Ks declaration of those 
figures. In others words, the general expectation was that it should seek some 
assurances of those figures through other means as well. PayPal may argue that it 
did this by estimating a median figure in each band. However, this clearly was 
problematic in this case.
PayPals guess as to what Miss Ks disposable income was equated to £500. 
However, it was equally possible given the ranges she declared that her disposable 
income was as little as £1 or as high as £1,000. Essentially, the information Miss K 
declared was not very helpful at all in determining whether she could reasonably 
afford a credit limit of £1,500.
I note PayPal completed a credit check, and as Ive mentioned above, it hasnt 
shown us the specific results of those checks (down to account level). However, from 
what Miss K has provided us, its clear she had been living in her overdraft on her 
current account for some time and was consistently more than £1,500 overdrawn. 
This would most likely have been visible on any credit check PayPal completed.
So, in summary, PayPal knew that the most Miss K earned was £1,000 per month (or 
potentially as low as £501) and that she had up to £500 in declared monthly 
expenditure. Given that I consider it likely it also knew she was consistently more 
than £1,500 overdrawn every month, that ought to have caused it to question its own 
assumption that Miss K had £500 in disposable income each month. If she did, her 
overdraft utilisation ought to have decreased month on month instead of fluctuating 
between £1,500 overdrawn and £1,800 overdrawn.
Further, based on what PayPal ought to have realised about Miss Ks existing credit 
utilisation (her overdraft), it would have been clear that any credit PayPal were to 
provide to her was going to be paid for using other credit, not from any available 
funds Miss K might have had left over after being paid. This is because her income 
(even if it had been as high as £1,000 per month) wasnt enough to clear her 
overdraft. So, it follows the only way she could pay PayPal was by using borrowed 
money from her overdraft.
This would not have been a sustainable arrangement and I think this ought to have 
been clear to PayPal at the point it completed its checks on whether to lend to her. I 
therefore dont think it made a fair lending decision by granting Miss K the credit. This 
is because it had a very real possibility of causing her detriment by causing her 
financial difficulty as she would be having to pay credit with other credit.
I also have considerable concerns about PayPals decision to increase Miss Ks 
credit limit in May 2020. This is because at this stage PayPal had already defaulted 
the account due to sustained arrears and financial difficulty and only the month 
before had reduced the limit. Im unsure why it considered it a sensible idea to 
increase the limit after this point given everything that had gone before it. However, 
as I think the complaint should be upheld from account opening, Im satisfied my 
proposed remedy (set out below) will also put right any unfairness caused by PayPal 
from this limit increase.
As I dont think PayPal ought to have approved the credit card at all, I dont think its 
fair that Miss K should have to pay any interest, fees, charges or insurances that may 
have been applied to the account. However, as she did spend money on the account, 
its fair she should pay back the capital amounts she borrowed. For the same 
reasons, I dont think it would be fair for her credit file to reflect adverse data in relation to credit she should never have received. So, once all adjustments have 
been made and Miss K has repaid the capital amounts borrowed, I think its fair for 
PayPal to remove all adverse reporting from her credit file in relation to this account.
Miss K accepted that outcome, but PayPal didnt. However, PayPal had no new evidence or 
comments to provide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided any new comments or evidence in response to my provisional 
decision, Ive seen no reason to reach a different conclusion. Im satisfied for the reasons 
given above in my provisional decision that PayPal acted unfairly in granting Miss K credit 
and increasing her credit limit. I therefore think it should put things right in the manner I set 
out in my provisional decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA to:
Rework the account removing all interest, fees, charges and insurances (not already 
refunded), so that Miss K only needs to repay any capital she borrowed. 
If the rework results in Miss K having paid more than she borrowed, PayPal should 
refund any overpayments, adding 8% simple interest to each overpayment from the 
date it would have first been made to the date of settlement. It should also remove 
any adverse information it has recorded on her credit file. Or;
If the rework results in Miss K still owing some capital to PayPal, it should set up an 
affordable repayment arrangement with her for the outstanding amount. Once the 
capital has been repaid, PayPal should remove any adverse information it has 
recorded on her credit file.
If PayPal has sold the debt to a third party, it should either arrange to buy the debt 
back to carry out the above directions or ensure that the third party carries out these 
directions on its behalf.
If PayPal considers tax should be deducted from the interest element of my award, it should 
provide Miss K with a certificate showing how much it has taken off so she can reclaim that 
amount if she is eligible to do so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 September 2023.
