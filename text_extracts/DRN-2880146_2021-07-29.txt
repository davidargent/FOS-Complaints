The complaint
Mrs F  via a representative  complains about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
handled a request for a refund of a mattress bought using her PayPal credit account. 
What happened
While this complaint relates to a purchase made using Mrs Fs PayPal account, the 
purchase and interaction with PayPal was done by one of her relatives. Ill refer to that 
person as the relative in this decision. 
The relative opened a dispute with PayPal after buying a mattress in November 2020. They 
said the mattress had been delivered damaged. 
On 31 December, PayPal told Mrs F that theyd refund the cost of the mattress. But under 
their buyer protection policy shed first have to pay for it to be returned to the seller. A 
webchat record on 1 January shows Mrs F told PayPal that she couldnt get any couriers to 
collect the mattress and deliver it back to the seller. The following day  2 January  the 
seller and the relative agreed a partial refund for the mattress, on the basis it wouldnt have 
to be returned. 
The dispute against the seller was closed. But the relative complained, because they felt 
PayPal should reimburse the remaining cost of the mattress, which hadnt been refunded by 
the seller. PayPal said they wouldnt, as the dispute was resolved outside of their process.
Unresolved, the complaint came to us. Our investigator looked at the details and found 
PayPal hadnt done anything wrong. Their buyer protection policy said the return postage 
would need to be paid by the buyer to get a full refund. And the resolution of the dispute 
directly with the seller meant PayPal didnt have to do anything more. 
Mrs Fs representative disagreed. They felt it was unfair Mrs F was out of pocket when she 
hadnt damaged the mattress. And they referred to another of PayPals policies  return 
shipping on us. They said this showed PayPal should have covered the cost of returning the 
items.
With no agreement to resolve the complaint, its come to me for a formal decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive found PayPal have taken a reasonable position in this complaint. Im 
not going to uphold it. 
The issue here is that the relative  who seems to have been authorised by Mrs F to use her 
PayPal account  agreed a resolution to the dispute about the mattress with the seller. The 
first stages of PayPals buyer protection process are based around the buyer and seller 
trying to agree a way to resolve their disputes. The process only escalates if they arent able 
to reach an agreement. 
As the seller and Mrs Fs relative agreed a resolution to the dispute, the buyer protection 
process has ended. I find thats in keeping with what the terms and conditions for the PayPal 
account said should happen. 
It also feels fair to me when considering how PayPals process works. When a dispute like 
this is raised with them, the money paid to the seller gets put on hold. If PayPal then side 
with the buyer, those funds are taken back from the seller, and returned to the buyer. 
So here  if things were done as Mrs F seems to want  that would mean the seller of the 
mattress having the remaining money taken from them, even though there was an 
agreement theyd keep that money instead of having the mattress returned. That doesnt 
seem fair on the seller, so Im not going to say PayPal need to do something more here to 
get Mrs F to that outcome. 
I appreciate the point that the relative found it difficult to return the mattress  and so claim 
the full refund the buyer protection policy would have offered  due to its size and problems 
getting couriers where they live. Ive looked online and it seems possible to get couriers to 
go to the address where I understand the mattress was. But theyre expensive  all the ones 
Ive seen cost over £150. 
PayPals buyer protection policy includes a term to say the buyer wont be able to claim for 
the cost of returning an item in a dispute. This does make the protection likely to be less 
useful for bigger items, where the cost of returning them is likely to be higher. I dont think 
that makes the policy unfair though. 
Its for PayPal to decide what policies it wants to offer its customers. There arent any rules 
or guidelines that say they must offer a policy to refund any return shipping costs, if a 
customer isnt happy with an item. Having decided they were going to offer a policy which 
didnt cover return shipping costs, it was enough for PayPal to make sure theyd made that 
clear to their customers. I find their terms and the information available on their website does 
that, to a reasonable standard. 
Ive asked PayPal about the return shipping on us policy Mrs Fs mentioned. Theyve noted 
then theres a £15 limit on the cost thatll be covered by that policy. Given the size of the 
courier costs Ive seen quotes for online, thatd mean Mrs F would likely have received less 
money if shed followed the full buyer protection and return shipping policies. 
With all this in mind, I find PayPal acted reasonably here. Theyve followed the terms of their 
policy, which was clearly explained to their customers. Their closure of the dispute fairly 
reflects the agreement reached between Mrs F  via the relative  and the seller. And that 
agreement seems likely to have been better for Mrs F financially than the buyer protection 
and return shipping on us policies would have been able to achieve. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2021.
