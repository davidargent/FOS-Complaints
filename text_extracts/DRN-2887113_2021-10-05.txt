The complaint
  Mr U complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused to investigate his 
claims of fraud on his debit card and failed to refund a series of transactions he didnt 
recognise.
What happened
Mr U noticed several transactions using his debit card that he didnt recognise. There were 
24 transactions totalling £572 all made to the same merchant over a period of about six 
months. He then contacted NatWest through their complaint system about the disputed 
transactions.
Mr U explained that he didnt want to use the phone as he needed a complete record of his 
dealings with NatWest. He suggested to NatWest that they contact him by email or post if 
they needed any further information.
NatWest told Mr U they couldnt investigate the disputed transactions because the fraud 
team didnt accept emails and their policy was to only deal with people using the phone. 
NatWest told Mr U that he could call them, or they would call him at a convenient time. 
Mr U told NatWest he didnt want to use the phone and repeated that he wanted to do 
everything in writing. Mr U said the complaints system had required specific private 
information that should satisfy NatWest that his claim was legitimate.
Mr U and NatWest maintained their relative positions, during which time several more 
disputed transactions were reported to NatWest. After three months had passed without any 
investigation, Mr U asked NatWest to cancel his card. Once the card was cancelled, there 
were no more disputed transactions.
Mr U brought his complaint to our service and our investigator asked NatWest for their 
investigation file concerning Mr Us disputed transactions. NatWest hadnt carried out any 
investigation into the disputed transactions. NatWest sent their final response letter(s) which 
repeated the need for Mr U to call them. They told our service that their policy was to only 
accept phone calls because they needed to discuss fraud prevention advice and explain the 
process with the account holder. 
Our investigator thought that NatWest had acted unfairly towards Mr U and upheld his 
complaint, recommending they refund £572 for the disputed transactions, pay 8% simple 
interest from 21 January 2020 until the date of the refund and £150 compensation. NatWest 
didnt respond to the investigators view and the complaint has been passed to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are essentially two main points concerning Mr Us complaint, one that NatWest 
wouldnt accept his notification to them about disputed transactions because hed chosen not 
to use a phone to report them. Secondly, that NatWest failed to investigate these 
transactions or refund them. Mr U also asked that we suggest to NatWest that they introduce 
a secure messaging system. 
While I understand that some of Mr Us concerns are about NatWests systems and 
procedures more widely  our role is to look at the individual circumstances of the 
complaints that are referred to us and reach a decision on whats fair and reasonable here. 
So, while I cant criticise NatWests systems on a wider basis, or say that it needs to change 
them, I can look at how what NatWest did in the individual circumstances of Mr Us 
complaint.
The starting point here are the terms and conditions for this account, summarised as: 
NatWest agree that theyll contact their customers if they think theyre account is 
subject to fraud and they provide various means to do that including post, phone, text 
or email.
They go on to say that if an unauthorised payment is suspected, the account holder 
(Mr U in this case) must contact a specific telephone number or contact their branch 
as soon as possible to enable NatWest to protect the account.
In circumstances where an unauthorised payment was taken from the account, 
NatWest agree (where the account holder is entitled) to refund them by the end of 
the next working day.
In Mr Us case, he notified NatWest there were unrecognised transactions on his account as 
soon as he became aware of them, but he used the complaints process to do it.
NatWest explained that their complaints system isnt designed for customers to use as a 
fraud notification tool. But, equally, Mr U included enough information to enable NatWest to 
investigate his concerns and he explained to the bank why he didnt want to use the phone. 
NatWest clearly wanted Mr U to contact it in a different way  through its usual channels  to 
explore the situation with him. Thats their process and theyre entitled to set that. But, rigidly 
sticking to this wont always lead to a fair outcome for a customer in their individual 
circumstances.
I think thats what happened here. NatWest responded by telling Mr U he needed to call the 
fraud department but saying that the only option was for him to phone wasnt helpful. Thats 
especially where Mr U made it clear that he didnt want to use the phone. He explained the 
reasons for this, and suggested NatWest could email or write to him if they needed any 
further information. On each occasion Mr U contacted the bank, NatWest repeated their 
message that Mr U had to speak with their fraud team.
The terms and conditions are specific about what to do when an account holder suspects 
fraud on their account  to either call a phone number or contact the branch. Mr U didnt, at 
this point, call the number or notify his branch  but what he did do is notify the bank about 
unauthorised transactions. Even though Mr U had used a different system to notify NatWest 
about the issue, the bank were now aware there was a problem with Mr Us debit card.
As the bank were now aware of the problem, they were at liberty to contact Mr U using any 
of the contact details they had for him. In fact, they wrote to Mr U on several occasions, but the context was always about procedure rather than dealing with the disputed transactions, 
until they cancelled and re-issued his card. NatWests own terms specify that the account 
holder must notify the bank as soon as they notice unauthorised payments to allow NatWest 
to protect the account. Thats what Mr U did, but NatWest didnt act to minimise the loss to 
Mr U.
Both parties hadnt strictly followed the terms and conditions, but the impact was felt most 
heavily by Mr U because NatWest wouldnt look into the substantive issue of the 
unauthorised transactions. 
NatWests own terms and conditions explain that there are a variety of methods that it has 
available to communicate with customers  not just the phone. I can see why the phone may 
be preferable to a business such as NatWest, as its quick and can facilitate a conversation 
around what may have happened. But, equally, some customers may not want to  or be 
able to  use the phone and thats a decision theyre entitled to make. So here, the strict 
adherence to a policy has, in this case, resulted in unfair treatment to Mr U.
Disputed transactions 
NatWests strict adherence to its policy meant that they didnt act on Mr Us notice to them or 
put a block on the card until several months later. Theyre refusal to accept a fraud 
notification meant they didnt carry out any investigation. If theyd accepted the notice from 
Mr U, they could have investigated the issue and blocked the card straight away, minimising 
the loss to Mr U.
In order to investigate such a complaint, our service would consider whether the transactions 
were authorised or not. That usually takes the form of evidence and testimony from both 
parties. In this complaint, NatWest didnt conduct any form of disputed transaction 
investigation, nor have they responded to the investigators view or offered any further 
comment beyond this.
So, Ive considered the issue of whether the transactions were authorised or not based on 
the information available to me. Mr U is the only party to offer any information about the 
transactions and hes been consistent with his version of events throughout the complaint. 
He said he didnt notice these transactions for some time because hes very busy and 
confirmed hes never had any relationship with the merchant. Mr U also confirmed he never 
lost his card.
Once NatWest blocked the debit card and re-issued it, there were no further disputed 
transactions which leads me to the conclusion that whoever was using the debit card details 
to make them didnt have regular contact with Mr U, because they werent able to obtain the 
new card details. Overall and based on the available evidence to me. I think it likely that Mr 
U had his card details taken and used without his permission. 
Taking everything into account, I think its more likely than not that Mr Us account was used 
without his authority to make the transactions he reported to NatWest. Additional 
unnecessary loss was suffered by Mr U because NatWest didnt accept his original 
notification nor investigate his concerns. I think its clear that this caused Mr U some 
frustration and distress for which NatWest should compensate Mr U. 
 
Putting things right Mr U reported a total of 24 transactions totalling £572.00 to NatWest. Had they acted upon 
this when he first notified them, the immediate loss to Mr U would have been less. Im 
satisfied that had NatWest investigated these as it should have  then it would and should 
have refunded these. Additionally, this should include interest at 8% (simple) from the date 
Mr U first informed NatWest of the disputed transactions until the date its repaid. They 
should also pay Mr U £150 for the unnecessary stress and inconvenience they caused him.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I uphold Mr Us complaint. I require 
National Westminster Bank Plc to:
Refund the disputed transactions of £572.00.
Pay Mr U £150 compensation.
Pay 8% interest on the disputed transactions from 21 January 2020, until the date of 
the refund. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
