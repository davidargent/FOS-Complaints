K820x#14complaint
Ms W says Lloyds  Bank Plc (Lloyds) mis-sold  her a Silver packaged bank  account.  Shes  
used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  into Ms Ws complaint and didnt think  Lloyds had
mis-sold the account.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Ms Ws complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Ms Ws complaint. Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Ms W chose to take the account as she 
applied for it online and without the assistance  of anyone from Lloyds. And as far as I can 
see she couldve used some of the benefits  too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Ms Ws decision  to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendation made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Ms Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms W to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 June 2019.
