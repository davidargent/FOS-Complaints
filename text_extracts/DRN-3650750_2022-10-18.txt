The complaint
Ms H complains that she was overcharged for her account by Think Money Limited (Think 
Money).
What happened
Ms H had an account with Think Money which was opened on 19 April 2021. It was opened 
as a current account which had a monthly charge of £10. On 27 April 2021, Ms H upgraded 
the account to a current account plus using the thinkmoney app. This provided additional 
features such as fuel and retailer discounts and charged £15 per month. On 20 May 2021, 
Ms H called Think Money and downgraded the account back to a current account.
On 7 July 2021, Ms H upgraded the account again to a current account plus  via the app. 
On 12 September 2021, Ms H downgraded the account again to a current account.
Ms H complained. She said she had been charged too much for her accounts; and had, on 
occasions, been charged twice in a month.
Think Money said Ms H hadnt been overcharged. They explained how the account 
upgrades and downgrades had affected the charges, and said the fees were in line with the 
type of account Ms H had. When Ms H upgraded her account, she accepted the terms and 
conditions of the new account which showed the new fee payable. They pointed out that on 
some occasions, there wasnt enough money in the account to meet the monthly charges 
and where that had happened, the charge wouldve been taken later  when there was 
enough money. Think Money looked at Ms Hs account and said she hadnt been over-
charged and only the agreed fees had been paid.
Ms H brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said Think Money acted reasonably. 
When Ms H upgraded her account, she accepted the new terms and conditions, including 
the new monthly fee. He looked at Ms Hs account and found that the fees paid were correct 
for the type of account she had. He said that between April 2021 and October 2021, a total 
of six fees were paid totalling £75, and this was correct. 
Ms H asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint. She said that she also wanted us to 
look at the charges on her previous account held with Think Money  which closed in May 
2021.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Ms H doesnt agree with our investigators view about her charges and has 
also asked us to look at the charges on her old account with Think Money which closed in 
May 2021. We asked Think Money about this aspect and they told us that Ms Hs complaint 
to them was only about her new account which was opened on 19 April 2021. And therefore, 
thats the complaint theyve looked at and which has been referred to us. As such, I have 
also only looked Ms Hs new account. If she wants Think Money to investigate the charges 
on her old accounts, she should contact them in the first instance.
So  looking at Ms Hs account from April 2021, I can see this is what happened:
 19 April 2021: Ms H opened her account with Think Money. This was a Standard 
Account with an account fee of £10 per month.
 29 April 2021: Ms H upgraded her account to Current Account Plus via her 
Mobile App. This meant the account fee was increased to £15 per month. This 
had added benefits such as fuel and retailer discounts. 
 20 May 2021: Ms H contacted Think Money and downgraded her account back 
to a Standard Account.
 7 July 2021, via the Mobile App, Ms H upgraded her account back to Current 
Account Plus. 
 12 September 2021: the account was downgraded again by Ms H via the app to 
a Standard Account.
I can see that when upgrading to current account plus in Think Moneys app, Ms H had to 
accept the terms and conditions, including the new charge of £15. And there was also a 
screen which said, we are upgrading your account to current account plusyour monthly 
fee £15 per month.. So  that was clear.
I looked at Ms Hs statements  and she paid the correct fee each month for the type of 
account she had:
 19 May 2021 - £15
 22 June 2021  £10
 20 July 2021 - £15
 20 August 2021  £15
 28 September 2021 - £10
 19 October 2021 - £10
The fee was due to be paid on 19th monthly. In some cases, the fee was taken slightly later 
because Ms H didnt have enough money in her account to cover it. And Think Money 
explained that when that happened, they took the fee later, when funds were available. I 
think that was a reasonable thing to do.
And so, having looked at Ms Hs complaint, my decision is that Think Money acted 
reasonably, and I wont be asking them to do anything here. As I said earlier, if Ms H wants 
to raise a complaint about the charges on her old account, she should contact Think Money.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
