The complaint
Miss A complains she incurred an early repayment charge and other costs unfairly when 
National Westminster Bank Plc gave her incorrect information about the portability of her 
mortgage.
What happened
In around May 2016 Miss A took out a capital and interest repayment mortgage, through a 
broker, with National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) for around £123,450 over a term of 
30 years. She bought her property with assistance from the government Help to Buy: 
mortgage guarantee scheme. Miss A had an initial fixed interest rate product for two years. 
She applied for two more two-year fixed interest rate products in around May 2018 and May 
2020. 
Before applying for a new product in 2020, Miss A checked with NatWest that the mortgage 
product she was looking at was portable as she was planning to move. NatWest told her it 
was, so she went ahead and applied on-line. 
In 2021 Miss A found a property she planned to buy on a shared ownership basis. She 
asked NatWest when she was applying for a decision in principle (DIP) whether buying a 
shared equity property would be an issue. They didnt give an answer on that call, even 
though they said theyd come back to it. NatWest issued a DIP and Miss A was left with the 
impression the lending would be possible.
A few weeks later, before a scheduled call to discuss the mortgage offer, NatWest let Miss A 
know they wouldnt lend on a shared ownership property. She complained as shed begun 
arrangements to move. In response NatWest said her mortgage had never been portable as 
shed had a Help to Buy shared equity mortgage. Based on that, Miss A decided to go ahead 
and buy the shared ownership property anyway, incurring an early repayment charge (ERC). 
As part of her complaint to this service Miss A disputed NatWests position that her mortgage 
had never been portable. She said the terms of her NatWest mortgage and the terms on 
which she took out the new fixed interest rate products allowed her to port provided, broadly, 
her existing property wasnt part of a shared ownership scheme, which she said it wasnt. 
Miss A said shed gone ahead and bought the shared ownership property to avoid wasting 
the costs shed already incurred based on what NatWest had told her and them issuing the 
DIP. She thought NatWest should reimburse the 2020 product fee and ERC because of the 
wrong information theyd given her. Miss A also wanted NatWest to pay brokers fees shed 
incurred to arrange a new mortgage; the fee for her new mortgage; and compensation for 
the less favourable rate shed had to agree to because her credit file had been adversely 
affected by NatWest declining her mortgage application. Miss A said NatWest caused her 
stress and she had to take time off work as a result. She spent time she could have used for 
overtime working dealing with her complaint, and she incurred costs in relation to the calls 
she had with NatWest. Overall, Miss A felt NatWest should pay her compensation of 
£11,550 to put things right.
Our investigator thought Miss As original mortgage offer had set out clearly that her 
mortgage could be ported to another property; although NatWest had given her inaccurate 
information, they hadnt advised her to take out the interest rate product in 2020 or to go 
ahead with her purchase which led to the ERC in 2021; and the offer NatWest made to 
resolve things fairly reflected the impact on Miss A of their mistakes. So, he didnt uphold her 
complaint. Since Miss A was unhappy with that outcome, her complaints been referred to 
me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge Miss As strength of feeling about what happened. I appreciate it was 
disappointing to be told she couldnt port the mortgage product when shed understood it 
would be possible. I can understand Miss A felt NatWests actions left her with a difficult 
choice between pulling out of her purchase and losing the costs shed already incurred on 
the one hand and going ahead and paying the ERC on the other. 
Miss A was advised on her mortgage with NatWest by a broker who was responsible for 
recommending a mortgage that suited her needs. NatWest issued an offer in May 2016. The 
mortgage offer made clear the interest rate product she was offered for the first two years 
was only available if she and the property she was buying met the Help to Buy: mortgage 
guarantee scheme criteria. 
Miss A had the right to repay the loan early, but an ERC was payable if she did. The offer 
said it might be possible to port the mortgage product  thats to say the two-year interest 
rate shed agreed  to a new property subject to her application meeting NatWests lending 
criteria current at the time she was moving. The offer made clear that NatWest might decline 
to lend at all on the new property. So, there was no guarantee an application would succeed. 
And it was a condition of the mortgage that Miss A let NatWest know if the property she was 
buying was shared ownership, as that might affect whether NatWest would lend. 
Miss A varied her mortgage in May 2018 when she agreed a two-year fixed interest rate until 
the end of July 2020. The mortgage illustration, which formed part of the variation 
agreement, set out the ERCs that would be payable if the mortgage was repaid before the 
end of the fixed term. The agreement said the terms of her mortgage remained unchanged 
except for the interest rate. And it said that if Miss As original mortgage product was, 
broadly, a shared equity mortgage, the mortgage product wasnt portable. Miss As mortgage 
was a Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme mortgage, rather than shared equity, so the 
product was portable. But the agreement made clear  as the original mortgage offer had - 
that Miss A had would have to meet NatWests lending criteria current at the time of moving 
to be able to port.
Before Miss A made her on-line application for the fixed rate product in 2020, she rang 
NatWest to confirm shed be able to port as she was thinking of moving. NatWest said, both 
before she completed the application and later, that she would. I think the information they 
gave her was right  even if NatWest gave her conflicting information later, which Ill come 
back to. 
The 2020 mortgage illustration, which formed part of the variation agreement, was in similar 
terms to the 2018 variation agreement. It set out the ERCs that would be payable if the 
mortgage was repaid before the end of the fixed term. And it said that all other terms in her 
original mortgage remained unchanged. Miss A still had to meet NatWests lending criteria 
current at the time of moving for porting the product to be possible.I think all the terms set out in Miss As original mortgage and in the two later variation 
agreements were clear, fair and not misleading as Id expect them to be. So, Miss A ought 
reasonably to have understood that any application she made to port her mortgage product 
to a new property would be subject to her meeting NatWests lending criteria current at the 
time she moved. It wasnt guaranteed an application to port would succeed. And if it didnt, 
and she wanted to move, an ERC was payable if she redeemed the mortgage. 
Ive thought about what happened when Miss A spoke to NatWest in 2021 about a DIP. The 
mortgage documents had flagged NatWests concerns about lending on shared ownership 
properties. On balance though, I think it was reasonable for Miss A to think NatWest would 
lend on the property she was planning to buy. Shed specifically mentioned it and NatWest 
raised no objection. 
But NatWest rightly explained a DIP is just an indication of what they might be prepared to 
lend subject to a full mortgage application. I can understand Miss A was keen to progress 
her move. But there was a risk her application to port might not succeed until shed gone 
through a full application. That would have involved looking at, amongst other things, the 
nature and ownership of the property she was buying. It was reasonable for NatWest to 
check any loan they agreed was adequately secured in line with their lending criteria at the 
time. The moving costs Miss A incurred before she got a formal mortgage offer were at her 
own risk. So, I dont think its fair to ask NatWest to reimburse them.
Ive considered whether the information NatWest gave Miss A in May 2021, in response to 
her complaint, that her mortgage was never portable, has had an impact on her. Based on 
what NatWest told her, Miss A had a difficult choice to make between losing the moving 
costs shed incurred and going ahead with the purchase and paying the ERC. She says if 
shed known she could have avoided an ERC by buying a different property, she would have 
looked for one.
Miss A told us she understood the terms and conditions of the mortgage meant her 
mortgage was portable. But she argues it was reasonable for her to rely on what NatWest 
told her in May 2021 in deciding to go ahead and buy the shared ownership property. Even if 
I accept that, its not certain Miss A would have found another property to buy. She says 
shed tried for several properties before she found the shared ownership property she went 
ahead with. And she missed out on buying other properties due to the competitive state of 
the market. 
Even if shed found another property, Miss As application to port her mortgage would always 
have been subject to NatWests lending criteria current at the time of her application. Theres 
no guarantee she would have been successful in her application to port her existing 
mortgage to an alternative property. Since her fixed rate doesnt expire until October 2022, 
she was always at risk of having to pay the ERC if she decided to move before then. 
On balance, Im not persuaded Miss As position would have been materially different if 
NatWest had told her in May 2021 it might be possible for her to port her mortgage product. 
She decided to go ahead with her move anyway and redeemed the mortgage knowing shed 
incur the ERC. Bearing everything in mind, I dont think its fair to ask NatWest to reimburse 
it.
The interest rate product Miss A applied for in 2020 was portable, as she expected it to be, 
and she benefited from the fixed rate until she redeemed the mortgage. So, I wont ask 
NatWest to reimburse the product fee. NatWest didnt act unfairly in declining to lend on the 
property as shared equity properties fell outside their lending criteria. So, its not fair to ask 
NatWest to compensate her for the consequences of that. But I think it was right for them to 
compensate Miss A for the distress and inconvenience she suffered because of the inaccurate information NatWest gave her. She had difficult decisions to make because of it, 
spent time and incurred the cost of calls sorting things out, and had to take time off work. 
Bearing everything in mind, I think the £400 NatWest paid Miss A to compensate her fairly 
reflects the impact on her of their mistakes. So, whilst I understand my decision will be 
disappointing for Miss A, I dont uphold her complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Miss As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
