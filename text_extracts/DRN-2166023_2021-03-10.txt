The complaint
Miss L and Mr C are unhappy that Barclays Bank UK PLC wouldnt allow them to borrow 
back the overpayments theyve made on their mortgage.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Theres no underlying right in the contract for any overpayments made to the mortgage 
to be borrowed back. The fact Barclays allowed this once before in 2016 doesnt alter 
that. This is covered in section 11 of the terms and conditions You cant ask us to return 
any overpayments you make. However you may, subject to certain conditions set out 
below, use your overpayment balance to fund any future underpayments.
Miss L has said Mr C shouldnt have been allowed to borrow back the overpayments in 
2016 without her express consent, but thats not so. The terms and conditions state 
Where you hold an account in joint names we shall be entitled to accept the signature, 
instruction or authority of either of you, unless you advise us otherwise. As Miss L 
and/or Mr C hadnt advised Barclays of the need for both of them to agree to anything 
on the account, then Barclays didnt act inappropriately in accepting Mr Cs request for 
the borrow back in 2016.
For these reasons I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Miss L and Mr C to accept or reject my decision before 8 April 2021.
