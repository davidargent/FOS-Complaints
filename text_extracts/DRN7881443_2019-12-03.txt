K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that the loans he had from Provident Personal Credit  Limited  (trading as 
Satsuma Loans) were  unaffordable to him.
background
Mr W had five loans from Satsuma between  November  2014 and August 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly  
RepaymentRepaid
1 19 Nov 2014 £100 13w £46.67 18 Aug 2015
2 18 Jul 2015 £100 13w £46.67 16 Jun 2018
3 28 Jan 2018 £100 6m £31.60 1 Aug 2018
4 17 Jun 2018 £100 3m £49.20 1 Oct 2018
5 13 Aug 2018 £200 8m £50.00 Outstanding
Mr W says that he had other debts at the time of the lending, including  an existing Satsuma 
loan which  was in arrears. He says the borrowing worsened his financial situation and he 
couldnt meet his priority  bills without borrowing again. Mr W says this caused him to get into 
a debt spiral.
Satsuma upheld Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 and 2. But it says that, based on the 
checks it carried out for loans 3, 4 and 5, that there was nothing to indicate  they were  
unaffordable. It says it asked Mr W about his income and expenditure and used information 
from his credit file to assess the affordability of the loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  Mr Ws complaint about loans 3 to 5 should also be upheld.  
She found Mr W was showing signs that he was struggling to repay his previous  loan when 
he applied  for loan 3. She also said that his pattern  of borrowing suggested  hed become 
reliant on short-term lending by the time he applied  for loan 4. Our adjudicator  recommended  
interest and charges (plus 8% statutory  interest)  on loans 3 to 5 should  be refunded and that 
adverse information  about loan 3 should be removed  from Mr Ws credit file. She added  that 
loans 4 and 5 should be removed from his credit file entirely.
Satsuma did not respond  to the adjudicators recommendation.
Mr W responded to say that Satsuma had now passed his account to a third party  debt 
collection agency.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Satsuma was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure Mr W 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr W was borrowing, and his lending history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Satsuma  had to do.
Im satisfied Satsuma has already settled Mr Ws complaint  about  loans 1 and 2, so I shall 
only consider his complaint about  loans  3 to 5 here.
Ref: DRN78814432Loan 3
When Mr W applied  for loan 3, Satsuma should have seen hed repaid  loan 1 late and loan 2 
was still outstanding. Given that Mr W had clearly  shown signs he was struggling to manage 
his money, I consider  Satsuma should  have  carried out a full financial review  before lending 
to him. I cant see it did that, so Ive had a look at what such  a review would have shown.
If Satsuma had done proportionate checks, it would have seen Mr W had six defaults on his 
credit file, two outstanding  short-term loans and was on a debt management  plan. So I think  
its likely  Mr W couldnt sustainably repay  loan 3 and Satsuma shouldnt have approved it.
Loans 4 and 5
Mr W applied  for loan 4 the day after he repaid loan 2, and before hed repaid loan 3. I 
consider that, by this stage, his pattern of borrowing  itself should have indicated to Satsuma  
that Mr W was unlikely  to be able to sustain the repayments. Mr W had been  in debt to 
Satsuma for well over three years by this stage,  was still using  other short-term  lenders and 
did not appear to be using  the loans as a temporary  cash flow solution. So I dont consider 
Satsuma should  have approved loans 4 or 5.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Provident  Personal Credit Limited (trading as 
Satsuma Loans) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loans 3 to 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 5, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr W; 
Arrange to repay any portion  of the sum due to the third party that is made  up of 
interest and charges   including any added by the third party;
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Ws credit file.
The number of loans  taken by loan 4 means any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 4 and 5 should be removed from Mr Ws credit  file 
once loan 5 has been repaid;
Request the third party to remove  any information it may have recorded about loan 5 
once it has been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma  to take off tax from this interest. Satsuma  must  
give Mr W a certificate  showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Satsuma 
intends to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 January 2020.
