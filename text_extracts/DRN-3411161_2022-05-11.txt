The complaint
Mrs P complains about the way that Santander Consumer (UK) plc, trading as Santander 
Consumer Finance, has dealt with the replacement of a car that was supplied to her under a 
conditional sale agreement but wasnt of satisfactory quality. Her husband is also involved 
with her complaint.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mrs P under a conditional sale agreement with Santander 
Consumer Finance that she electronically signed in May 2021. She complained to the dealer 
about some issues with the car and it agreed to replace the car later that month. It contacted 
Santander Consumer Finance about updating the conditional sale agreement for the 
replacement car. Santander Consumer Finance confirmed that the agreement had been 
updated and it issued a full clearance letter sixteen days later. 
Mrs P complained to Santander Consumer Finance about some difficulties that she had 
experienced with that process. It provided a detailed description of what had happened and 
said that there were instances that the correct information hadnt been provided and it 
offered a compensation payment of £100. Mrs P didnt accept its offer and complained to 
this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
hadnt seen anything to suggest that Santander Consumer Finance had caused any delays 
to the process and he didnt think that it was responsible for any of the costs that Mrs P says 
were incurred. He also said that he hadnt seen any evidence that Mrs P received a poor 
service when calling Santander Consumer Finance and, although some of the information 
she was given may have been incorrect, it didnt have a big impact and Santander 
Consumer Finance had offered a fair amount of compensation for that.
Mrs Ps husband, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Hes provided additional evidence, including a call recording with Santander 
Consumer Finance from the end of May 2021, a full transcript of a conversation with the 
dealer and the dealers notes of its exchanges with Santander Consumer Finance which he 
says show that it delayed the process, gave incorrect information and provided poor 
customer service. He also says that Santander Consumer Finances representative was 
rude about him on one of the phone calls.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the car that was supplied to Mrs P under the conditional sale agreement wasnt of 
satisfactory quality and the dealer agreed to replace it;
the dealer contacted Santander Consumer Finance about updating the conditional 
sale agreement for the replacement car in late May 2021 and Santander Consumer 
Finance has provided its internal system notes and a detailed description of what 
happened;
it accepts that some incorrect information was provided about the process but it 
confirmed that the agreement had been updated and it issued a full clearance letter 
sixteen days after it was contacted by the dealer  Mrs Ps husband clearly feels very 
strongly that that was an unacceptable delay but Im not persuaded that it was unfair 
or unreasonable that it took Santander Consumer Finance sixteen days to complete 
the process or that it unreasonably delayed the process;
it accepts that it provided some incorrect information about the process and it offered 
a compensation payment of £100 which wasnt accepted  Mrs Ps husband says 
that Santander Consumer Finance hasnt taken into consideration the poor level of 
customer service provided or the financial loss that Mrs P incurred of £464 for 
insurance, £25 for road tax, £330 for taxi and travel costs and a £1,000 deposit for 
the replacement car;
I dont consider that the incorrect information that Santander Consumer Finance 
provided caused an unreasonable delay to the process or is likely to have caused 
distress and inconvenience to Mrs P that would justify an award of compensation of 
more than £100;
other than the incorrect information that it provided, Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the customer service that Mrs P received from 
Santander Consumer Finance was unprofessional or fell below a reasonably 
acceptable standard or that its representative was rude about her husband;
I dont consider that Mrs P has provided enough evidence to show that she incurred 
additional insurance, road tax or travel costs, or that the deposit of £1,000 that she 
paid for the replacement car, were the result of an unreasonable delay by, or poor 
customer service from, Santander Consumer Finance and I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to require it to reimburse her for any of those costs; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Santander Consumer Finance to pay to 
Mrs P the £100 that it has offered to her (if it hasnt already done so) but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Santander Consumer Finance to pay 
her any other compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that, if it hasnt already done so, Santander Consumer (UK) plc, trading as 
Santander Consumer Finance, should pay to Mrs P the £100 compensation that it has 
offered to her.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
