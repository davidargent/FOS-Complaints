The complaint
Mr L complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr L was given ten loans by Sunny between September 2017 and May 2018. Each of the 
loans was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but Mr L repaid many of the loans well 
before the agreed date. At times Mr L had up to four loans outstanding at the same time. All 
of Mr Ls loans have been fully repaid and a summary of his borrowing from Sunny is as 
follows;

In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first three loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Mr L.
DRN-1910533I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing loans 4 to 6. But Mr L 
hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have 
shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Sunny had been wrong to agree these 
loans.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 7, Sunny should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mr L's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide further loans. 
I asked Sunny to pay Mr L some compensation in relation to loans 7 to 10.
Neither Mr L nor Sunny has provided us with any further information or evidence in response 
to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither party has provided 
me with any new evidence or further comments I see no reason to alter the conclusions 
I reached in my provisional decision.
I don't think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr L from loan 7 onwards. Sunny needs to 
pay Mr L some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr L after, and including, the loan he took 
on 14 February 2018 (loan 7). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
refund any interest and charges paid by Mr L on the loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 10 should be removed from
Mr Ls credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ls complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
