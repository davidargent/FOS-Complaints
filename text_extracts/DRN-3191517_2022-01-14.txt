The complaint
Mr C complains Zopa Limited wont reduce the interest rate on his personal loan.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In February 2020 Mr C applied to Zopa for a loan. It accepted his application and set out its 
terms in a Fixed Sum Loan Agreement. These included how much Mr C was borrowing, 
what his repayments would be and how much interest hed be charged. I find the terms were 
clear and Mr C doesnt dispute accepting them, and thereby agreeing to be bound by them. 
Unfortunately, a short time after taking out the loan Mr Cs circumstances changed as a 
result of the Covid pandemic. Zopa  in line with Financial Conduct Authority guidance  
supported Mr C by agreeing to period of reduced repayments. Mr C felt as his circumstances 
had changed, he should be allowed to renegotiate the loan terms, including the interest rate. 
I accept Mr Cs circumstances changed. But he entered into a binding agreement with Zopa. 
There is no requirement for it to renegotiate the terms. Zopa may have deviated from them 
at times, such as by accepting reduced repayments for a while, but this was to support Mr C. 
Supporting him in this way was a concession and doesnt change the underlying agreement.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
