Complaint
Miss W complains about charges Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited (VWFS) 
applied at the end of her Hire Purchase  Agreement. She would like the charges waived.
Background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties, so I will not repeat  them  again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator  for these reasons:-
VWFS has already agreed  to waive the charges  for excess miles. As that is what  
Miss W wanted,  I see no reason to make any comments with regard to that aspect of 
Miss Ws complaint.
The inspection report lists scratches to the front and rear bumper. And these clearly 
show in the inspection report photos.  I didnt  find Miss Ws photos persuasive. 
Unfortunately, they were not close enough for me to show  they over rode the 
evidence in the inspection report.
VWFS uses British  Vehicle Rental  and Licensing Association (BVRLA)  guidelines  as 
its benchmark for assessing  damage. I felt the damage listed  ,and evidenced by the 
photos, fell outside  BVRLAs  fair wear  and tear guidelines. So, I dont think VWFS 
were wrong to charge for it.
VWFS doesnt have to supply  an invoice to confirm the cost of work carried out to the 
car. Its a business decision as to whether it makes repairs  to a vehicle or sells it on 
without doing  so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 November 2020.
