K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that Uncle Buck Finances LLP was irresponsible to lend him money as he 
was borrowing from a number of payday  lenders at the same  time.
background
Mr F took out 11 payday and instalment loans with Uncle  Buck between January 2015  and 
May 2017. A summary of his loans is below:

11 £600.00 02/05/2017 26/05/2017 £296.39
Mr F says that better checks  wouldve  shown  that he was in financial difficulties and that 
short term lending wasnt suitable for him.
Mr F asked  Uncle Buck  to refund the interest  that hed paid and remove any negative 
information about the loans from his credit file.
Before this service became involved, Uncle Buck offered to put things right for loans  four and 
five. 
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Fs complaint be upheld in part. The adjudicator 
thought that Uncle Buck shouldnt have  agreed loans four to 11. The adjudicator asked 
Uncle Buck  to refund the interest and charges that it had paid on loans six to 11 (as Uncle  
Buck had already offered a refund on loans four and five). 
The adjudicator also recommended  that Uncle Buck remove  any negative  information about 
loans four to six. And he asked Uncle Buck to remove loans seven to 11 entirely  from Mr Fs 
credit file.
Uncle Buck  disagrees  with the adjudicators recommendation. It says that just because  a 
customer borrows again doesnt automatically mean that they are reliant on short  term 
lending or that the loans are unaffordable.  Uncle Buck says that short  term loans are meant  
to be flexible to help with unexpected expenses.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ref: DRN39266172Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Uncle 
Buck should  fairly and reasonably have done  more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required  to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. 
This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines  sustainable  as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if they will need to borrow  
more money to afford the repayments.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F didnt  disagree with the adjudicators  opinion  about loans one to three, Because  of this, 
I dont think there is any ongoing  dispute  about these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
Ref: DRN39266173about this lending. But as the loans were part of the borrowing relationship  that Mr F had 
with Uncle  Buck, I will take them in to account  when considering his other loans.
Uncle Buck  has already  offered to put things  right in line with what I wouldve ordered in 
relation to loans  four and five. So my final decision will focus on the loans that remain  in 
dispute  loans six to 11.
loan six
By loan four, I consider  that Uncle Buck shouldve been carrying  out better checks  than it 
did. If Uncle Buck had done  this, it seems likely that it wouldve discovered  Mr F owed 
money to at least seven  other payday lenders. 
Mr Fs situation  didnt improve over the subsequent  loans. This means that at the time of 
loan six, Mr F was still borrowing money  from other lenders just to keep up with his loan 
repayments. I consider  that Uncle Buck shouldve realised that it was unlikely  that Mr F could  
sustainably afford to repay loan six.
loan seven to 11
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Mr F with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have given Mr F any more  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
seven. I say this because the overall  pattern of Mr Fs borrowing suggested that hed 
become persistently reliant on short term loans.
Loan seven was the seventh loan that Mr F had taken out in just under eight months.  
Although there had been a gap of about  three months in between repaying  loan six and 
taking out loan seven, Uncle Buck has given us evidence of at least  two declined  loan 
applications in the interim.  
Mr F went on to borrow larger amounts from Uncle Buck. Taken with the previous evidence 
of Mr Fs reliance  on short term lending, I consider that Uncle  Buck should have realised that 
it was more likely than not Mr F needed  to borrow further to fill the hole repaying  his previous 
loans was leaving in his finances.  
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed Uncle Buck  and his indebtedness  
was being prolonged.  This meant that Mr F had been paying large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Uncle  Buck over a long period.
Although I appreciate that there was a longer break in lending before Mr F applied  for loan 
11, I take account of the previous pattern of repeated borrowing and the fact that Mr F asked 
for his largest loan.  Uncle Buck  was also aware that Mr F owed money to at least one other  
payday lender  when  he took out loan 11. So I dont consider  the gap should necessarily be 
taken as an indication  that Mr F had moved on from whatever situation had required his 
previous loans. 
I consider that Mr F lost out because  Uncle  Buck continued to lend money from loan seven 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN39266174these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the extended period of time he owed Uncle Buck money  was likely to have had 
negative implications on Mr Fs ability  to access mainstream credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
Even if I was to agree that the gap in lending between loan 10 and 11 was sufficient to break 
the chain, I still dont consider Uncle Buck shouldve given Mr F loan 11. This is because  
Uncle Buck  was aware that Mr F had at least one other outstanding payday loan for £520. 
Uncle Bucks records  show that Mr F had a disposable monthly income of £850 at the time 
of loan 11. The monthly repayment on loan 11 was just under £300.  This left Mr F with little 
more than £30 for unexpected expenses. I dont consider that this was enough  to say that  
Mr F could  afford to repay loan 11 in a sustainable way. Particularly as there would have 
been interest to pay on the other  payday loan and Uncle  Buck had recorded a zero figure  
against food, travel and heating  costs  for Mr F.
Im upholding Mr Fs complaint about  loans four to 11. As Mr F has had the benefit of the 
money lent to him, I consider its fair to allow Uncle Buck to apply the refund against any 
outstanding principal still due on loan 11.
to put things right,  Uncle Buck should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr F paid on loans four to 11;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 11; 
if it chooses to, apply the refund  against  any outstanding principal balance  on loan 11 
before paying  remaining balance (if there  is any) to Mr F**; 
remove any negative information  about loans four to six from Mr Fs credit  file; and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan seven means that any information about  
loans seven to 11 is negative. So all entries  about loans seven to 11 should be removed 
from Mr Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Uncle  
Buck intends  to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding principal balance, it must do so 
after deducting tax.
**If after carrying out the above steps there is still an outstanding balance,  I remind  Uncle 
Buck of its obligation  to treat Mr F reasonably and sympathetically if he puts forward  any 
repayment proposals.
Ref: DRN39266175my decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint in part. In full and final settlement, I direct Uncle  
Buck Finance LLP to put things right as detailed above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 October  2019.
