K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that Speedloan Finance Limited  gave him loans that he couldnt afford  to 
repay. He asks that it refunds  interest and charges and removes  information  about the loans  
from his credit file.
background
Mr A took out one loan with Speedloan in early 2013. Our adjudicator  didnt recommend that 
the complaint  should be upheld. He said Speedloan had carried  out affordability checks  and 
assessed the loan repayments (£88 per month) as affordable. 
Mr A didnt agree. He said he hadnt  received information from Speedloan about the amount 
of the loan and the repayment terms. Mr A said he thought the loan had been rolled over.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Speedloan provided  a copy of the loan agreement signed by Mr A in January  2013. Mr A 
borrowed £600. The loan was repayable in 12 monthly instalments of £88. 
Speedloan asked Mr A for bank statements and payslips to check his monthly income.  It 
says his average monthly income was about £1,550 and his direct debits didnt exceed 50% 
of this. It provided copies  of the bank statements, pay slips and utility  bills it received from 
Mr A to us. 
Given the amount  of the repayments  and Mr As income, I think Speedloans checks were  
proportionate. Based on the information it received,  I think it was reasonable for Speedloan 
to assess the loan repayments as affordable.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
