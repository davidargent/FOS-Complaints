The complaint
Mr M is complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA closed down his dispute and ruled in
the sellers favour.
Mr M is represented by his partner in bringing this complaint. But for ease of reading, Ill refer
to any submission and comments she has made as being made by Mr M himself.
What happened
Mr M purchased an item online and paid for it through PayPal. Mr M felt that the item was
significantly not as described, so he contacted the seller and said that the only solution for
him to resolve this would be a refund. The seller offered Mr M a partial refund ($14.99) for
the item.
Mr M escalated his dispute to PayPal. He received an email from them on 15 October 2020
informing him that the case had been closed and PayPal had denied his claim as the dispute
was submitted with insufficient information/documentation to support the claim and they
were unable to obtain the required information after requesting it from Mr M.
Mr M used the chat facility to communicate with a PayPal agent. He asked the agent to raise
a formal complaint. PayPal did not uphold Mr Ms complaint. In summary they said that they
sent Mr M an email on 4 October 2020 to his email address which gave him 10 days to
respond to their request but as they hadnt heard back from him they closed the dispute and
found in the sellers favour. While Mr M said that he didnt receive the email they sent him,
PayPal said that dates are significant as failure to provide the information will cost him the
case.
Mr M brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator did not uphold his complaint. In
summary, our investigator said that he considered whether PayPal had acted in line with
their User Agreement and his view was that PayPal acted as they shouldve done. Mr M
responded to our investigator with a number of points including that PayPal had apparently
started their investigation 37 days after the dispute had been raised while they generally take
30 days for simple cases, which Mr M believed this shouldve been, PayPal wouldve had
access to messages that Mr M had sent the seller in the PayPal Resolution Centre, so they
shouldve known that Mr M only wouldve accepted a full refund for the item and not a partial
refund.
Our investigator said that it was unlikely that PayPal wouldve actively monitored direct
messages exchanged in private between buyers and sellers and that PayPal shouldnt need
to change their standard investigation procedure because of this. Mr M asked for his
complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman as he didnt believe PayPal should decline his
claim on stage 3 of their online dispute resolution process as they didnt ask him to provide
physical evidence.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional 
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I need to explain that its not the role of this service to say how PayPal should run
their dispute processes, however, Ive looked to see if PayPal have followed their own
dispute process and Im satisfied they have and that they treated Mr M fairly, even if he
doesnt see it this way. Ill explain why below.
I can see from the information that PayPal has sent me that the seller had told them on 1
September 2020 we shipped according to the order. The product customer received is
consistent with our description. We have over checked our product before, theres no quality
issue with our item. The item can be used normally so we will provide discount 30% for
customer. So I do think PayPal had started the investigation earlier than Mr M may have
been aware.
PayPal have said they sent an initial notification of the offer to Mr M on 1 September. But Im
persuaded that Mr M hadnt seen this notification as hes also said he didnt receive the
email that PayPal had sent on 4 October 2020. The contents of the email were the same. I
know our investigator has provided Mr M the email PayPal sent on 4 October but PayPal
hadnt told our service previously that this was a reminder email and exactly the same as the
notification they sent Mr M on 1 September. Ive mentioned the information of the 1
September notification to provide context that Im persuaded thats why it took PayPal longer
to ask Mr M information than the 30 days than PayPal generally take to resolve a case. But
regardless of how long it took PayPal to resolve a case, Im not persuaded the length of time
from start to finish was the reason why they declined Mr Ms dispute.
Its not in dispute that Mr M didnt see the email(s) that PayPal had sent. But in order to
uphold the complaint I would need to see that PayPal hadnt followed their procedures.
PayPal have provided evidence that they sent the email on 4 October to Mr Ms registered
email address. So, if Mr M has not received the email, I cant hold PayPal responsible for Mr
M not receiving an email they sent to his registered email address. PayPal have also
provided records from Mr M logging into PayPal during the 10 days which they gave him to
respond to their question on 4 October. So PayPal say that Mr M wouldve been able to view
the status of the dispute in the Resolution Centre when he was logged into PayPal.
The contents of the email include the following: please provide any information we ask you
to send us within 10 days. If we dont hear back from you within this time frame, we may
decide this case in the sellers favour. A partial refund of $14.99 USD has been suggested to
resolve this complaint. Please let us know if you accept or reject this partial refund offer. If
you dont make a decision on this partial refund offer, we will complete the investigation and
determine the outcome of the case. So, what I would expect PayPal to do here, as they
didnt hear back from Mr M is for PayPal to complete the investigation, which they did. And
determined the outcome of the case in the sellers favour.
Ive considered what Mr M has said, that in his original dispute with the seller he said the
only way to resolve the issue would be for the seller to issue a full refund - so PayPal
shouldve known that he wouldnt have accepted the partial offer. And I think this is a fair
comment that Mr M has made. But Im not persuaded that PayPal shouldve checked the
Resolution Centre to see what message exchanges occurred between the buyer and seller
before they got involved in a more formal setting.
I say this as PayPal started their investigation after this message was sent to the seller.
While Mr Ms position on the refund may remain that the only satisfactory issue for himself
would be a full refund of the item, I think it wouldve been unfair for PayPal to make
assumptions in their investigation that Mr Ms starting position would remain the samethroughout the investigation. So by asking Mr M if he wanted to accept the partial offer, this
would be an important step in progressing the investigation, regardless of what Mr M had
said previously to the seller, before the dispute had started to be investigated by PayPal.
I know that Mr M believes that step 3 of PayPals online dispute resolution appears to refer
to physical documentation/evidence so Ive thought about what step 3 says: Step
3: Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information, after you, the seller
or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement. PayPal may require you to
provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal
specifies. You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our
correspondence with you.
While I can understand why Mr M believes this does reference physical documents such as
receipts, third party evaluations etc, Im not persuaded that this refers solely to physical
evidence as the first line of step 3 clearly says respond to PayPals requests for
documentation or other information. So while PayPal did not at that stage ask Mr M for any
documentation, they did ask him for information. And the information they asked him is if he
accepted the partial offer. And they set a deadline which would indicate a response was
needed. And when PayPal didnt receive this information, they made a final decision in line
with their online disputes process which includes the option of automatically closing the
dispute if they dont receive information theyve asked for in a timely manner. So, for the
reasons Ive previously stated, it follows that I dont intend to ask PayPal to do anything
further.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final 
decision. PayPal said they had nothing further to add. Mr M did not respond to my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As PayPal had nothing further to add and Mr M did not respond to my provisional decision 
my final decision and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision. I know Mr 
M will be disappointed with the decision, but I hope he understands my reasons.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2021.
