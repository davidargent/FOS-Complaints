The complaint
Miss S has complained that PayrNet Limited wont refund an ATM withdrawal where she 
explained the cash did not dispense. 
What happened
This complaint regards a Pockit branded account.
In June 2021, Miss S tried to withdraw £220 from a cash machine. She explained that it 
made sounds like it was going to dispense the cash, but then didnt, and she never received 
the money. But her account was nonetheless debited for £220.
Miss S raised this a number of times with PayrNet, who eventually raised a chargeback in 
late October 2021, but didnt refund the transaction.
Miss S came to our service. Our adjudicator asked PayrNet for key evidence to show what 
happened during the attempted ATM withdrawal. But PayrNet didnt provide this. So our 
adjudicator proposed that PayrNet refund the disputed withdrawal.
PayrNet didnt agree. They felt that we should gather the evidence to defend PayrNets side 
of the complaint instead. The complaints been passed to me to decide.
I sent Miss S and PayrNet a provisional decision on 8 August 2022, to explain why 
I thought the complaint should be upheld. In that decision, I said:
In order to hold Miss S liable for this withdrawal, it is only fair and reasonable that PayrNet 
should be able to show they were entitled to debit it from her account. This usually involves 
evidence such as the ATMs electronic records and balancing information, to show whether 
the withdrawal went through and dispensed properly.
PayrNet are able to ask the ATMs owner  a fellow financial business  for this information. 
This is very standard practice in ATM disputes like this one. But so far, PayrNet have not 
done so  despite the time theyve had. Our normal timescale is to give both sides two 
weeks to provide information, and PayrNet have had over three months.
Our service is independent, so we dont represent either side and we normally expect each 
party to evidence their own side of the case. And PayrNet are perfectly capable of speaking 
to the ATM owner themselves. The onus is on PayrNet to gather this evidence. And Im not 
sure what else they expect to happen if they decline to evidence their own side of the case.
Since PayrNet havent provided the key evidence to show what happened during this 
attempted withdrawal, I cannot rule out that the cash machine experienced an error, or that it 
was tampered with using a device such as a cash trap, and so on. 
Currently, the only evidence I have is Miss Ss testimony, which is clear and credible about 
her cash not being dispensed. And I have no good reason to disbelieve her.
So based on what Ive got so far, I find that PayrNet do not have a fair basis to hold Miss S 
liable for this attempted withdrawal. It follows that I think they should refund it, and add 
simple interest to compensate Miss S for the time shes been without her money.
Of course, I am willing to reconsider this if PayrNet provide all of the key evidence. But that 
will need to be done before the deadline of this provisional decision.
I also note that Miss S had to raise this with PayrNet a number of times, and frequently 
chase them for updates. PayrNets communication looks to have been poor, and they took 
far too long to deal with this issue. In the meantime, I understand that Miss S fell behind on 
her essential bills, had to borrow money from family, and that it added significant stress onto 
her already severely stressful situation  which PayrNet were aware of. That needs to be put 
right, too.
When a business gets things wrong like that, we often tell them to pay compensation  to 
acknowledge their error and the impact it had. Looking at our guidelines for amounts of 
compensation, I think PayrNet should pay Miss S a further £150 for the non-financial losses 
it looks like they caused her.
I said Id consider anything else anyone wanted to give me  so long as I received it before 
22 August 2022. But neither party sent me anything new to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither side have sent me any new evidence or arguments. So having reconsidered the 
case, Ive come to the same conclusion as before, and for the same reasons as set out in 
my provisional decision above.
Putting things right
I direct PayrNet Limited to:
refund the £220 disputed withdrawal;
pay simple interest to Miss S on this transaction, at the rate of 8% simple a year, 
payable from the date it was debited until the date its returned; and-
pay Miss S an additional £150 compensation for the trouble and upset they caused.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet to take off tax from this simple interest. PayrNet must 
give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if she asks for one.My final decision
I uphold Miss Ss complaint, and direct PayrNet Limited to put things right in the way I set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
