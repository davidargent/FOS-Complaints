K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that FirstRand Bank Limited  (trading  as MotoNovo)  hasnt treated him fairly 
following a change in his circumstances that resulted in a vehicle hed acquired under a hire 
purchase agreement  being voluntarily surrendered. 
background 
In June 2016 Mr P entered into a five year hire purchase agreement for a van with 
MotoNovo. Unfortunately  in September 2016 Mr P contacted MotoNovo and said his 
circumstances had changed and the agreement was unaffordable. MotoNovo told Mr P he 
could either,  voluntarily terminate the agreement and return  the van but would owe 50% of 
the amount borrowed, part exchange  the vehicle or privately sell it and settle the finance.    
Mr P said he would like to consider  his options. 
In October  2016 Mr P told MotoNovo that his situation had altered for the better and a 
payment plan was agreed. But in November 2016 Mr P told MotoNovo he wasnt  going  to be 
able to afford the agreement and so would sell the van and settle  the finance. 
Mr P found  a dealership that said it would  buy the van from him for £8,000. This still left an 
outstanding balance of £3,300 that Mr P would need  to pay to settle the agreement in full. 
Mr P says the dealership told him it worked with MotoNovo  and if he paid the £3,300 directly 
to it then the dealership would settle the finance with MotoNovo for him. Mr P handed the 
van and £3,300 to the dealership.  
But when Mr P checked with MotoNovo he discovered that the finance hadnt  been settled. 
MotoNovo chased  the dealership on Mr Ps behalf.  A cheque  for £3000 was received by 
MotoNovo from the dealership and it said it would  pay the balance after Christmas. However 
the cheque then didnt clear and MotoNovo told the dealership it would take legal action. 
Mr P says the dealership told him to come and collect  the van as it couldnt afford to pay for 
it. So Mr P took the van back but didnt get his money reimbursed. He told MotoNovo he had 
the van back and that he would now voluntarily  surrender it so that MotoNovo could sell it. 
MotoNovo sold the van in February 2017 but for less than £8000  meaning the shortfall  was 
now over £4,000. MotoNovo wrote to Mr P and advised that the outstanding balance under 
the agreement  needed to be cleared or the debt would  be passed to a collections agency. 
Mr P acknowledged  the letter and during a telephone call in April 2017 MotoNovo says it 
was agreed that Mr P would be given three months to clear  the outstanding balance.  But 
MotoNovo says no payment was received and the outstanding balance  was passed to a 
collections agency. 
The collections agency made contact with Mr P in June 2018. Mr P complained to MotoNovo 
about its handling of the matter. He raised  a number of issues  in his complaint.  Mr P said 
that MotoNovo  hadnt provided  him with sufficient support when he found the agreement  
unaffordable; that it had been slow to act against  the dealership; that it had failed to pursue 
legal action against the dealership; that thered been  poor contact with him over the 
outstanding balance and no follow up correspondence. 
Ref: DRN29431702Mr P said he thought the matter had been  resolved  due to the amount of time that had 
passed and that MotoNovo should now consider his account closed. 
MotoNovo didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint.  It said that it hadnt  endorsed  Mr Ps plan to sell 
the van via the dealership and that as it had no relationship with the dealership it wasnt  
under any obligation to pursue legal  action against it. MotoNovo also said it had contacted 
the dealership  to assist Mr P but that Mr P was liable under  the agreement  for the 
outstanding balance. 
Mr P was unhappy at MotoNovos response  and complained to this service. Our adjudicator 
didnt recommend Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. He said that he didnt think  MotoNovo 
had acted unfairly. It had raised taking legal action  with the dealership  when it had custody 
of the van as this had been MotoNovos property at the time. When  the van had been  
returned to Mr P by the dealership he had then voluntarily surrendered it to MotoNovo who 
had arranged its sale. Mr P remained legally responsible for the outstanding balance  despite 
the promise by the dealership to settle the agreement.  
Our adjudicator also said that as MotoNovo hadnt  advised Mr P to settle  the agreement  via 
the dealership  it wasnt responsible for what had happened.  
Mr P disagreed with our adjudicators view. He says he wasnt treated fairly due to the delay 
in seeking payment, the lack of contact and that legal  proceedings were initiated against the 
dealership originally. He says its unfair  the liability for the debt appears to have  swung 
between himself and the dealership. Mr P says this has left him in a difficult position 
financially. 
As the parties couldnt  agree the complaint  has been passed to me. 
my findings 
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly I would like to say Im very sorry Mr P has found himself in this position. Not only is he 
facing an outstanding balance on the financial  agreement but he lost money given in good  
faith to the dealership to settle that agreement. I can appreciate this will have been a very 
stressful time for him.
Unfortunately though  I think  Mr P has misunderstood the relationship  between  MotoNovo 
and the dealership in respect  of any legal proceedings. At the time MotoNovo started legal 
action the van, which  under the agreement remained the property of MotoNovo, was at the 
dealership. This meant the dealership  had the van without MotoNovos permission. 
But once the van was returned  to Mr P, he then surrendered  it back to MotoNovo so, as it 
had no relationship with the dealership, there  was no obligation to continue  with the legal 
action. I dont think this legal action meant that MotoNovo considered the dealership was 
liable under the terms and conditions of the credit agreement for the amount borrowed.  
I also think it was reasonable for MotoNovo to take the action that it did against the 
dealership to have  its property  or the value of that property  returned to it. This would have 
been to Mr Ps benefit if the dealership hadnt  returned the van to him.
Ref: DRN29431703Once MotoNovo  had the van back it sold it without delay. Ive seen that Mr P always 
understood that by selling the van privately there would  be a balance  left to pay because the 
sales price of the van wouldnt match what had been  borrowed under the agreement.  This 
situation is very common due to vehicles depreciating in value over time.
,
Mr P reached an agreement with the dealership that it would settle the finance agreement 
with MotoNovo on his behalf. This involved not only handing over the van but also an 
amount of money  to cover what would  have still been outstanding  under the agreement  after 
the dealership  had paid the agreed price for the van. MotoNovo wasnt  a party to this 
agreement and I cant see that it ever told Mr P that by making  this arrangement  his liability 
under the agreement would pass to the dealership.  I also havent seen that MotoNovo 
recommended the dealership to Mr P.
Im sorry  that the dealership took Mr Ps money and hasnt reimbursed him. But I cant  
reasonably hold MotoNovo responsible for this. If Mr P wants to get his money back  then 
legal action against the dealership maybe an option,  although I can understand that he may 
not want to do this. Mr P may want to get some specialist advice before pursuing  any such 
course of action. 
When MotoNovo sold the van it reached  a lower figure than that which  the dealership  had 
agreed to pay. However, some time had since passed and I cant  reasonably  say that 
MotoNovo should  be responsible for the drop in value. This meant  that Mr P owed more than 
the original £3,300 hed expected to pay.
MotoNovo informed Mr P about the outstanding amount in March  2017 and there followed 
some further  contact. MotoNovo says Mr P requested and was given three months  to pay in 
April 2017. It would  appear that its agreed  Mr P hasnt paid this amount.
I appreciate Mr P was frustrated to receive  contact from a collections agency after nearly a 
year had passed since his last contact with MotoNovo. But I cant reasonably or fairly say 
that this means  MotoNovo cant pursue this debt.  It had notified him of the amount due and 
that if it wasnt paid action would be taken so Mr P was aware of this.
However, Mr P is facing financial difficulties over repaying this amount and I would expect in 
these circumstances  MotoNovo to treat him positively and sympathetically. 
So for the reasons given above  Im not upholding Mr Ps complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above Im not upholding Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 December  2019.
