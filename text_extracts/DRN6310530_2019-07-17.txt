Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN63105302the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that Sunny had done anything  wrong  when it lent loans 1 to 4. 
Neither Mr C nor his representatives have  disputed this as such, there  isnt a continuing 
dispute about these loans. I have  focused  my decision on loans 5 onwards  the loans still in 
dispute.
By the time Mr C was requesting loan 5, three of his four previous loans were overlapping, 
Mr C was repaying loans  1 to 3 at the same  time.  Mr C took out loan 4 about a month after 
repaying loan 3 and he borrowed loan 5 the day after he took out loan 4. From what I can 
see, loan 5 was for an amount higher than any of his previous loans. And as Mr C had taken 
out his previous loans in quick succession  (this was now the third instance  when 
Mr C had taken out a loan a day after borrowing a previous loan) I think  Sunny shouldve 
been concerned  about  why he needed to borrow so often. I think Mr Cs need to borrow  
again so quickly  after borrowing a previous loan suggests he was struggling.
Im also mindful that Sunnys checks for loan 5 show that Mr Cs credit commitments had 
increased considerably  from the time of loan 1 and taking this altogether,  Sunny ought to 
have realised that his indebtedness was increasing and that he was likely reliant on these 
loans and it shouldnt  have continued to lend.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN63105303Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  days of borrowing a 
previous one. Mr C was repaying more than one loan at a time and when he did 
repay his outstanding  loans, he was borrowing further within  days. This is a pattern 
that continued throughout the lending and Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr C was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out nine months after Mr Cs first. And Mr C wasnt  able to free himself from 
relying on these loans.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
and:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 12 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 5 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Cs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 12 should be removed from Mr 
Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr C compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
