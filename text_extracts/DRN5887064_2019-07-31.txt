K820x#14complaint
Ms P has complained that Bank of Scotland plc mis-sold her a packaged  bank account  
which it called the Ultimate Reward Current Account  (URCA).
background
Ms P took out an URCA in 2009.  The fee was £12.50 a month. The URCA benefits  included 
phone insurance,  travel insurance, car breakdown cover and a fee free overdraft up to £300.
Our adjudicator looked at Ms Ps complaint and thought that even if the URCA was mis-sold, 
Ms P had not lost out financially. 
Ms P disagrees so the case has come  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Ms Ps complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold  Ms Ps complaint and Ill explain  why. 
Bank of Scotland has accepted that the URCA was mis-sold and agreed to return  Ms Ps 
URCA fees with added interest in the way that this service would require.
But, Bank of Scotland has also provided  evidence  that as a result  of having the URCA Ms P 
paid out much less in overdraft fees and charges  over the many  years she had the account 
than she would have  done if shed had a fee free account. And the amount she has saved 
exceeds the amount Ms P paid in fees for the URCA.
So in my view Ms P has not lost out as result of anything Bank  of Scotland  may have done  
wrong. 
I know that Ms P will be disappointed with this but Im satisfied that it would not be fair and 
reasonable for me to return the fees she paid for the URCA in these circumstances.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, Im not upholding Ms Ps complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 August 2019.
