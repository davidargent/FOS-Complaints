K821x#15complaint
Ms K says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Ms K had 22 loans  with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information  QuickQuid provided 
about the loans in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  the complaint and explained why he thought that QuickQuid  was 
wrong to have approved loans 4-21. QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the 
complaint was passed to me to decide. As theres been no further  dispute  about loans 1-3 or 
loan 22, Ill only be considering loans  4-21 in my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Ms Ks case. 
Ive decided to uphold Ms Ks complaint about loans 4-21 and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms K 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Ms Ks income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
 
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Ms Ks complaint. These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Ms K would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would  
those checks have  shown that Ms K would have  been able to do so?
Ref: DRN256049522.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Ms Ks indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Ms Ks complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Ms K would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have  
shown that Ms K would have been  able to do so?
Ive not considered whether QuickQuid  carried out proportionate checks  for loans 1-3 or 22, 
as theyre no longer  in dispute  and so its not necessary  to make a decision on this question.
I also havent recreated individual, proportionate  affordability checks for loans  4 to 21 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Ms Ks indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ks case, I think that this point 
was reached by loan 4. I say this because:
Ms K struggled to repay  loan 3 to schedule. It was originally due to be repaid on 
25 July 2008 but was extended to October 2008.  Ms K then borrowed a similar  
amount just 10 days later, suggesting she was dependent on the loans and was 
struggling to settle  them  sustainably.
this pattern of reborrowing shortly after settling loans generally continued. Although  
one large gap occurred at the time of loan 18, Ms K had been borrowing persistently 
from QuickQuid for over three years by this point. In this context, a seven month gap 
wasnt enough for QuickQuid to safely assume Ms K was back on a more stable 
financial footing.
Ms K was clearly  struggling to free herself  of the need to reborrow from QuickQuid. 
And she was in effect paying large  amounts of interest to service her debt over an 
extended period
Ms K was demonstrating repayment  difficulties at various  times;  she extended and/or 
paid late fees on a large number  of loans
I think that Ms K lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 4 until loan 
21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ks indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
Ref: DRN25604953the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ks ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Ms Ks complaint about  loans 4 to 21 because the overall pattern of lending 
increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and she 
lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms K in some  
other way.  
other matters
Id like to make it clear I have carefully considered all the points QuickQuid  raised in 
response to the adjudication. But these points havent changed my mind. Many of the points 
raised relate  to the FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook  (CONC), which wasnt  in force for 
any of the loans I considered in my decision.  The broader point though, was that QuickQuid 
believes that number  of loans isnt in itself a factor which  could suggest  the lending  wasnt  
sustainable.
I dont agree with this. Its possible  the number of loans  wont  always be a factor   for 
example where  there are significant gaps between the loans and its clear the consumer isnt 
relying on them to supplement their income. But where that isnt the case, I think the number 
of loans is potentially  a significant  factor  although other factors still include the gaps 
between those loans  and the amounts borrowed. As QuickQuid put it in its final response to 
Ms K:
if you were dependent on taking out one loan to repay the other then you would have 
taken out numerous loans, for equal or increasing  loan amounts, and with very little time 
between paying  off one loan and taking out the other.
In my view, this is exactly what happened in Ms Ks case. Im not sure why QuickQuid  is now 
rejecting the concept of the number of loans indicating unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
lending, when it appeared to accept the concept  in its final response  (albeit  whilst not 
accepting it applied in Ms Ks case).
Ref: DRN25604954I havent set out all of the reasons this service considers  the pattern of lending to be a 
potentially relevant factor. As Ive said, this information is available  on our website. And 
QuickQuid is familiar with it from previous decisions. 
QuickQuid hasnt explained why it thinks the pattern  of lending in Ms Ks case  doesnt 
suggest her indebtedness increased in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful. 
So the points  it raised havent changed my decision.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms K paid on loans 4 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 4 to 21 should be removed from Ms Ks credit file
QuickQuid can offset the redress  against  the balance of loan 22 if Ms K still owes  it anything 
and as long as it still owns the debt.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  give 
Ms K a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 June 2019.
