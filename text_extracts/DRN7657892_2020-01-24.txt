K820x#14complaint
Mr C doesnt think Barclays Bank UK Plc (Barclays) has paid him fair compensation in 
response to a complaint about  the sale of a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
background
Below, Ive summarised  the materially relevant facts in this case:
In January 1997, Mr C borrowed £10,000 from Barclays.  He borrowed an extra  
£1,439.15 to pay for PPI policy upfront. This type of policy  is called a single 
premium PPI and Mr C had to pay interest  on the extra  he borrowed. (In this 
decision, Ill refer to this policy as PPI policy 1.)
Unfortunately, Mr C lost his job in July 1997.  He made a successful claim on 
PPI policy 1 and received  12 payments  of £400.57 (his scheduled monthly loan 
payments). In total, he received £4,806.84.
Under the terms of the policy, Mr C could only receive 12 payments per 
unemployment claim.
Regrettably, Mr C was unemployed for longer  and he couldnt  keep up with his loan 
payments.
In 2001, Barclays  agreed to accept £3,361.97  less than it was owed and 
subsequently marked his loan account as satisfied.
In 2012, Mr C wrote to Barclays to complain  that PPI policy  1 was mis-sold.
Barclays upheld his complaint and paid him £500. It said it would have ordinarily 
refunded everything hed paid for PPI with simple interest (at 8% per year).  But it said 
it didnt know how much  Mr C had paid for PPI policy 1.
In 2014, Barclays  wrote to Mr C following an internal review of some of its old 
complaints. It said it still couldnt calculate an accurate refund of what  Mr C had paid 
for PPI policy 1, but it wanted to pay Mr C the average PPI refund it pays  consumers. 
At the time, this was £1,893  so Barclays paid Mr C £1,393 to top up the £500 hed 
already received.
In 2018, Barclays  wrote to Mr C about  a different PPI policy. In January 1997,  as well 
as borrowing £10,000 from Barclays, Mr C borrowed £10,000 from a different bank.  
Barclays later acquired this bank and took responsibility for the sale of a PPI policy  
with this second loan. (To avoid confusion, Ill refer to this policy  as PPI policy  2.) In 
2014, Barclays upheld  Mr Cs complaint that PPI policy 2 was mis-sold. And, as with 
PPI policy 1 and for the same reason, it paid him £1,893. It wrote to him in 2018  to 
say it had conducted another internal review. It said it should  have paid him 
£3,189.96  so it paid him £1,296.96 to top up the £1,893 hed already received.
Understandably, on receipt of this letter in 2018,  Mr C contacted Barclays  to query 
the compensation hed received for the mis-sale  of PPI policy 1. Barclays  replied to 
say it didnt think it needed to pay him any more compensation.  So Mr C referred  his 
complaint to our service. 
Mr C says the two loans were for the same amount and he serviced them  in the 
same way. So he thinks the PPI compensation should be the same.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can certainly appreciate  why Mr C thinks Barclays should pay him more compensation for 
the mis-sale of PPI policy  1. Given the similarities  between PPI policy  1 and 2, its 
Ref: DRN76578922reasonable for him to assume the compensation should be similar too. And Barclays  hasnt 
explained why it isnt. However,  I think  Barclays  has paid Mr C more  than I would  have told it 
to if Id concluded that PPI policy 1 was mis-sold. So I dont  think  it needs to pay him any 
more. Ill explain why.
When a business  accepts, or we decide, that a PPI policy was mis-sold, Id expect it 
to put the consumer  in the position hed be in now if he hadnt bought the policy. In 
this case, Mr C says he wouldnt have bought PPI if hed known he could only claim 
for unemployment for up to 12 months. But if he hadnt had PPI, he wouldnt have 
been able to make a claim for 12 months.  So I think its fair for Barclays to take this 
into account when  calculating Mr Cs PPI compensation. Mr C received £4,806.84 
when he made his claim.  The loan agreement Mr C has provided shows he borrowed 
an extra  £1,439.15 to pay for PPI policy 1. And if the loan had run to term, hed have 
paid an extra £375.25 in interest and £1,814.40  in total for PPI. I appreciate that 
things didnt go as planned. But on the evidence available to me, Im satisfied that 
Mr C didnt pay more than £4,806.84 for PPI  so I dont think  Barclays  needs to pay 
him any compensation.
Second, when  a business accepts less than its owed from a consumer, and the 
consumer subsequently complains about PPI, I think its fair for the business to take 
into the amount  it wrote  off. In this case,  Barclays wrote off £3,361.97. As above, I 
think Mr C paid less than this for PPI in total.  So even if he hadnt  made a claim, I 
wouldnt have told Barclays to pay him any compensation.
As Barclays  has paid Mr C £1,893  in compensation  for the mis-sale of PPI policy 1, 
and I wouldnt have  told it to pay him anything, I think  what  its done is more  than fair.
Finally, we look at each case on its own merits. I havent looked  at the compensation 
Mr C received from Barclays for PPI policy 2. I cant explain why Barclays  paid Mr C 
any compensation for the mis-sale of PPI policy 1 in view of what  Ive said above.  
And if, as he maintains,  Mr C serviced both loans in the same way and made a 
similar claim on PPI policy 2, I dont know why it paid him any compensation for this 
policy either  let alone more. But I dont need  to. Suffice it to say, I dont think Mr C 
hasnt lost out a result.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I dont think Barclays Bank UK Plc needs to pay Mr C 
any further compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
