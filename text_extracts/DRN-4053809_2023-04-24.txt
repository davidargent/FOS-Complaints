The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) limited his account and 
asked him to provide identification documents (ID). 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr A greed to PayPals User Agreement when he opened his account. Our service 
can look at whether that User Agreement has been applied fairly in the 
circumstances of a complaint. 
PayPals User Agreement allows it to limit an account and ask for ID if they have 
concerns over how an accounts being used or payments coming into that account. 
If the decision to limit an account has been made in line with the User Agreement in a 
fair and reasonable manner, then wed usually say that PayPal has acted fairly.
Although Mr A says that he verified his account in 2008 and 2017, this was some 
time ago and PayPal can ask for ID at any point it has concerns. 
Im unsure as to why Mr A doesnt want to provide the documents, but having 
considered what PayPal have asked for, I dont find the request unreasonable or 
unfair. 
PayPal dont need to notify Mr A of the specifics of its concerns. As a business it can 
make a commercial decision to not disclose these reasons. Our service has seen the 
reasons for the verification request, and we also dont need to disclose these. I 
understand PayPal sent Mr A an email in December 2022 giving him some detail 
around its concerns. 
 Hopefully Mr A can be assured that Ive seen these reasons and dont find the limit 
has been placed unfairly or against the terms of the account.
In summary, PayPal have carried out a review on Mr As account and asked him to provide 
ID. Mr A hasnt provided these documents, and so his account remains limited. PayPal have 
agreed to lift the limitation once Mr A agrees to send whats been requested -which Im 
satisfied is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2023.
