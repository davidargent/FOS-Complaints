K820x#14Complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked  and closed  his 
accounts. He says this caused him significant distress and inconvenience.  He wants  
NatWest to provide  an explanation for its actions.
Background
Mr A had five accounts with NatWest.
In April 2019, NatWest  reviewed Mr As accounts. Whilst it conducted the review it placed a 
block on all of the accounts. This meant  Mr A wasnt able to access any money in the 
accounts. And no payments could be made from the account.  
On 30 April 2019, NatWest wrote to Mr A to let him know  it had decided  to close  his 
accounts.
Mr A says he discovered his accounts  were blocked when he tried to log in to his accounts. 
He says he was shocked and upset.  And immediately contacted NatWest to find out why he 
couldnt access his accounts. But NatWest wouldnt give him a proper explanation  for its 
actions. Mr A says as a result of the blocks he was left without access to any money for a 
week and couldnt  pay for everyday living expenses. And the banks actions affected his 
health.
Mr A complained to NatWest. On 16 May 2019,  NatWest wrote to Mr A and said its not 
obliged to enter into any discussion with Mr A to explain its decision to block and then close 
his accounts.  It explained  that had it acted in accordance with the terms and conditions. 
Unhappy with this response Mr A brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator explained NatWest werent  required to provide their reasons for the block 
and closure of Mr As accounts. And having looked  at everything he was satisfied NatWest 
had acted fairly and in line with the terms and conditions of the accounts.  So, he didnt  
uphold the complaint.
Mr A disagreed. Hes still upset that NatWest blocked and closed his accounts without 
explanation. He says this caused him a great  deal of anxiety and he had to visit his doctor.  
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for the block of Mr As accounts. Anti-money laundering 
regulations and UK legislation place extensive  obligations on regulated  financial businesses  
to have suitable systems  in place for customer identification. Financial institutions  must also 
establish the purpose and intended nature of a business as well as the origin  of funds, and 
there may be penalties  if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships 
NatWest has said that Mr As accounts were blocked to meet these legal  requirements.
Mr A says he hasnt done anything which  would  cause  NatWest to block his accounts. And 
that may well be the case. But as Ive already explained businesses  have a legal obligation 
Ref: DRN26969292to comply with various laws and regulations. The terms and conditions that apply to Mr As 
accounts also outline the circumstances  in which NatWest can block an account.  And having  
considered those terms carefully, and the information the bank relied  on, Im satisfied 
NatWest acted in line with them. So, I cant say NatWest did anything  wrong  when it blocked  
Mr As accounts.
account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr A had to comply  with 
 say that under certain circumstances it could close the accounts  immediately  or by giving 
him 60 days notice. So, its entitled to close the accounts as its already done.
I know Mr A is frustrated  that he hasnt been  given a proper explanation why his accounts 
were blocked and then closed. But under the terms and conditions NatWest doesnt  have  to 
give a reason. So, I cant say NatWest  has done  anything wrong by not giving Mr A this 
information  as much as hed like to know.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr A feels about whats happened,  and Im sorry this 
whole experience made him feel unwell. I dont  doubt it was a frustrating and upsetting time 
for him. But overall, based  on the evidence I have, I cant say NatWest  have acted  
unreasonably and treated Mr A unfairly  when it blocked and closed his accounts. So, I wont  
be asking NatWest to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2020.
