The complaint
Miss C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refunded a buyer under its buyer 
protection policy, despite her providing proof of delivery.
What happened
In mid-2022, Miss C received a payment of around Â£600 into her PayPal account after 
selling an item via a social media platform. 
Shortly afterwards, the person who sent the payment raised a dispute under PayPals buyer 
protection policy, claiming that the item had not been received. 
Miss C provided tracking information to show the item had successfully been delivered to the 
address shed been given by the purchaser. However, PayPal closed the claim in favour of 
the buyer and refunded the payment to them.
Miss C complained to PayPal, but the matter wasnt resolved. So, she asked our service to 
consider her concerns.
Our investigator thought Miss Cs complaint should be upheld. He recommended it refund 
her the amount that was sent back to the buyer (less any applicable fee).
PayPal didnt agree with our investigators outcome. So, the complaint has been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Miss Cs complaint. Ill explain why. 
PayPal says Miss C wasnt eligible for seller protection. However, I dont think its adequately 
explained why the buyer protection dispute was closed in the buyers favour.
PayPals buyer protection policy says:
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if
The seller has provided proof of delivery
Proof of delivery is defined as: Online or physical documentation from a shipping company 
that includes:
An online and verifiable tracking number
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction 
Details page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
PayPal says there was no address on the transaction details page. So, Miss C doesnt 
appear to have had the option of sending it there. 
Miss C has provided screenshots of messages regarding the sale of the item. The purchaser 
appears to have arranged for the payment to be made from someone elses PayPal account. 
However, I havent seen any evidence to suggest that the PayPal account holder wasnt 
aware of the transaction or didnt agree to it.
Miss C has also provided tracking information showing that the item was successfully 
delivered to the shipping address given by the purchaser. I can also see that Miss C shared 
tracking details with PayPal at the time of the dispute. 
Given the above, Im not persuaded that PayPal acted fairly when it closed the claim in the 
buyers favour and refunded the payment. So, I think PayPal should reimburse Miss C for 
the amount she lost out on as a result. 
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Miss C the amount it refunded to the buyers account (less any applicable 
fee).
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Cs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 January 2023.
