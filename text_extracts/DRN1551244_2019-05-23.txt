When Mr L complained  to Pounds to Pocket it didnt uphold his complaint. Unhappy with the 
response, Mr L referred his complaint to this service  where it was looked at by one of our 
adjudicators.
Our adjudicator thought that Pounds to Pocket  lent Mr L loan 7 when he couldnt afford to 
repay. She didnt recommend that Mr Ls complaint about the other loans should be upheld. 
Pounds to Pocket didnt agree that it had irresponsibly lent loan 7, it said it lent the loan in 
line with the regulators  rules and guidance.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has come to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Pounds to Pocket was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make checks  to see 
whether Mr L could afford to pay back each loan over the term before it lent to him. So, in 
making this decision  Ive first considered whether Pounds  to Pocket  did everything it should 
have when assessing Mr Ls credit applications. And, following on from this, Ive thought 
about whether  any assessment failings resulted in Pounds to Pocket agreeing  to lend to him 
when it should  have known that it would be difficult for him to repay. 
Ref: DRN15512442Our adjudicator looked at all the loans  in line with the approach set out on our website. Ive 
reconsidered the information available  and what our adjudicator has said and I agree  that for 
loans 1 to 6 and 8 to 12, Mr Ls circumstances  suggest  that he was in a position to 
sustainably repay  the loans.  
And so while  Pounds to Pockets checks for some  of those loans didnt go far enough, a 
closer look at Mr Ls circumstances suggest  that the loans were affordable for him at the 
time. Mr L or his representatives havent raised  any new points  or arguments about the 
adjudication and so I havent gone  into further details about those loans here.
Ive also looked  at Mr Ls complaint about loan 7 and I agree that Pounds  to Pocket  should  
have been conducting a review of Mr Ls financial circumstances and verifying the 
information provided before agreeing to lend.
As stated above, Pounds to Pocket was required to lend responsibly  and it had to carry out 
borrower focussed checks to see that Mr L could afford each loan.  Loan  7 was a refinanced  
loan, which  means  that Mr L applied for further borrowing while he hadnt  repaid a previous 
loan. And a new loan was approved  which then increased his level of indebtedness.  This 
was now Mr Ls fourth  loan in this borrowing  chain  and the new loan amount was around 
£920, this was higher than his previous loans.
In the circumstances, it wouldve been  proportionate  for Pounds  to Pocket to verify  some of 
the information provided and had it done  so, its likely to have found that Mr L couldnt 
sustainably afford to repay this loan. Mr L has provided copies of bank statement which 
show his actual financial circumstances  at the time. And from what I can see, he was 
borrowing from other short term lenders, at the time he had around £480  outstanding in 
other short term loans  and from what I can see, he was also gambling regularly. In 
October 2015  the month before this loan was approved, Mr L spent around £560 on 
gambling transactions. This wasnt a sustainable  position as Mr L had outgoings on his 
normal living  costs and regular credit commitments. Pounds to Pockets ought to have been 
aware of this from sufficient checks and as a responsible lender shouldnt  have  lent to him in 
those circumstances.
As Mr L was lent a loan he couldnt afford, Pounds to Pocket needs to put things right.
putting things right
I dont think that Pounds to Pocket  should have given Mr L loan 7 in November 2017, so for 
this loan it should;
refund  any interest and charges  applied to it,
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ls credit  file in relation to this loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Pounds to Pocket to take off tax from this interest.            
Pounds to Pocket  must give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN15512443my final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part and require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.
