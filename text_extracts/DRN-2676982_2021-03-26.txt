DRN-2676982
Complaint
Mr D has complained that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) provided him with an unaffordable 
loan. He says his poor credit record should have alerted L2G to the fact that he had a lot of 
problems and it should have known the loan was unaffordable.  
  
Background
L2G provided Mr D with a loan of £500 in February 2020. This loan had an APR of 1,013.2% 
and an 18-month term. This all meant the total amount repayable of £2,057.04 was due to 
be repaid in 18 instalments of £114.28.
One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought that L2G unfairly provided this 
loan to Mr D as proportionate checks would have shown it was unaffordable. L2G disagreed 
with our adjudicator and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive
referred to this when deciding Mr Ds complaint.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Ds complaint. These two
questions are:
1. Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr D 
would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
o If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
o If not, would those checks have shown that Mr D wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr D would be 
able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
L2G provided this loan while it was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). The rules and regulations in place required L2G to carry out a reasonable 
and proportionate assessment of Mr Ds ability to make the repayments under this 
agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so L2G had to think about whether repaying the 
loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Mr D. In practice this meant that 
L2G had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt cause Mr D undue 
difficulty or adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for L2G to simply think about the likelihood of
it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr D.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given loan application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
Were L2Gs checks reasonable and proportionate?
L2G says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr D prior to 
providing him with this loan. It also carried out a credit check. Mr D declared that he was 
earning around £1,600.00 a month and had expenditure of around £220 a month. L2Gs 
checks suggested his income was closer to £1,400.00 and his expenditure was closer to 
£1,150.00. But this still left him with enough to cover the payments to this loan. 
Ive carefully considered what L2G has said. But the credit check it carried out showed Mr D 
was having difficulty repaying a loan. So Id dispute that the credit file showed he was 
managing his existing credit well. And this coupled with Mr Ds credit card balances being at 
or around the respective credit limits, together with L2G not being confident in the 
expenditure information Mr D provided, such that it adjusted the figures and its adjustments not capturing all of Mr Ds expenditure lead me to think that L2G needed to take steps to 
verify Mr Ds actual monthly expenditure. 
As I cant see that this L2G did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out before 
providing Mr D with his loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to L2G that Mr D would have 
been unable to repay this loan?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before this loan was provided,
I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So I need to decide whether it is more likely
than not that a proportionate check would have told L2G that Mr D would have been unable 
to sustainably repay this loan.
L2G was required to establish whether Mr D could make his loan repayments without 
experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments were 
technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ive carefully considered the information provided. Having done so, its clear that Mr D was 
struggling to manage his existing debts and was using payday loans to try and manage his 
commitments. So I think that proportionate checks would have shown L2G that Mr D was 
likely to use this loan for this purpose, or to at least cover the hole this left in his finances, 
which meant he was unlikely to be able to repay it without borrowing further or suffering 
significant adverse consequences.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would
more likely than not have demonstrated that Mr D would not have been able to make the
repayments to this loan without borrowing further and/or suffering undue difficulty. And, in 
these circumstances, I find that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than 
not have alerted L2G to the fact that Mr D was in no sort of position to make the payments 
on this loan without suffering significant adverse consequences.
Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr D in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. And having done so, Ive not seen anything 
to suggest that L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr D in some other way. So I 
dont think L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr D in some other way.
Did Mr D lose out as a result of L2G unfairly providing him with this loan?
As Mr D paid a high amount of interest and charges on a loan that he shouldnt have been 
provided with, Im satisfied that he has lost out as a result of what L2G did wrong.
So I think that L2G needs to put things right.  
Fair compensation  what I think L2G needs to do to put things right for Mr D
Having thought about everything, L2G should put things right for Mr D by:
removing all interest, fees and charges Mr D paid on this loan;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr D to the date of settlementremoving any adverse information recorded on Mr Ds credit file as a result of this 
loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires L2G to take off tax from this interest. L2G must give    
Mr D a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.  
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint. Loans 2 Go Limited needs to 
put things right in the way set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 April 2021.
