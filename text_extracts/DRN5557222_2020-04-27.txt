Miss S says S.D. Taylor Limited,  trading as Loans  a Home, lent to her irresponsibly.
Background
Miss S had sixteen home credit loans  from Loans at Home, between November 2015 and 
April 2018. Ive summarised some of the information Loans at Home provided about  the 
loans in the table below.

An adjudicator considered  Miss S complaint and thought it should  be upheld  in part. He 
didnt think Loans  at Home was right to have provided loans  5 to 16. Loans at Home didnt 
agree with the adjudicator  (although it did concede there was a period of rapid lending after 
August 2017,  but it made no offer).  As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed 
to me to decide.  As theres been  no ongoing  dispute about loans 1 to 4, Ive not looked  at 
the decision to approve those  loans.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Loans at Home needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN55572222But certain factors might  point to the fact that Loans  at Home should fairly  and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Loans at Home was required to 
establish whether  Miss S could sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss S complaint.
For loan 5 I can see Loans at Home  captured some income and expenditure information 
from Miss S before deciding whether to lend. Miss S weekly  income is recorded as £242.05,  
from various state benefits.  Miss S total weekly expenditure is recorded as £111.99   this 
included £26 towards existing Loans at Home loans (presumably loans 3 and 4), £20 for 
food and £0 for any other credit commitments.
I dont think the approach  Loans at Home  took to assessing the affordability of loan 5 was 
proportionate, for a number of reasons. There were no gaps in the lending  up to this point, 
with loans 3 and 4 both taken out on the same day preceding loans were repaid  
suggesting Miss S wasnt borrowing to meet  a cyclical shortfall in her income (which in any 
event wasnt from employment  and so wasnt subject to significant cyclical variations) but to 
meet an ongoing  need. Miss S had also taken out another loan earlier in the same month, 
making the total amount  Miss S borrowed  the largest amounts to date. And although Ive not 
seen the results of any credit checks Loans at Home  carried out (if it did), I dont think  Loans  
at Home could reasonably  accept Miss S had no other credit  commitments  whatsoever.
Taking everything into account,  I think Loans  at Home ought to have asked Miss S for some 
sort of proof of income and expenditure. Shes  provided us with her bank statements and 
Ref: DRN55572223whilst this might not mean I can say exactly what Loans at Home wouldve seen had it 
carried out proportionate checks, I think they provide a good indication.
Ive seen that in August 2016  Miss S did have a number of other  monthly credit 
commitments  including £52 to a home  furnishing  providers,  £230 to another  alternative 
lender, £55 to credit-based  catalogues  and a number of smaller payments to other  creditors 
like debt collection agencies. Ive also seen that Miss S was borrowing from a credit union 
during this time.
So I think Miss S was paying  something closer to £100 a week  to her existing creditors when 
she applied  for loan 5. And I think Loans at Home would have seen this had it carried out 
proportionate checks. Taking  into account  the other  income and expenditure information  
Loans at Home obtained, I dont think loan 5 was sustainably affordable for Miss S and so 
Im upholding her complaint about  it.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Loans  at Homes lending  history with Miss S, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Loans  at Home should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Loans  at Home should  
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss S case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Loans at Home ought  to have realised Miss S was not managing  to 
repay her loans sustainably. Miss S had taken out six loans within  12 months  and 
had been indebted  to Loans at Home during that entire period. Most of the loans 
were taken  out either shortly after or on the same  day as a previous loan was repaid.
So Loans  at Home ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss S was 
having to borrow  further either to cover the hole repaying a previous loan was leaving 
in her finances, or to meet an ongoing  need.  And so Miss S indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss S continued to be provided with a new loan on the same  
day as settling a previous  loan.
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Loans at Home.  
Miss S last loan was taken out over two years after her first and was for a larger  
amount. Miss S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
Loans at Home over an extended period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  Loans at Home  continued to provide borrowing from loan 
6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss S ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
I understand Loans at Home feels that some customers use its loans in a cyclical way, or 
like a credit  card and so it doesnt  agree  that repeat borrowing is harmful. I dont agree this 
Ref: DRN55572224applies in Miss S case. I dont think Loans at Home carried out proportionate checks for 
loans 5 onwards   so I dont think it did enough to ensure the loans could be repaid 
sustainably. And given Miss S circumstances - including that she wasnt in employment  and 
consistently reborrowed on the same  day as repaying other loans  I dont think  her use of 
the loans suggests as cyclical shortfall in her income. I think its more likely  she was 
borrowing in a way which wasnt sustainable, as Ive set out above.
So for the reasons given above  Im also upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 16 and 
Loans at Home should put things right.
putting things right
Loans at Home shouldnt have given  Miss S loans 5 to 16.
If Loans at Home has sold the outstanding  debts  it should buy these  back  if it is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Loans  at Home is not able to buy the debts back then it 
should liaise  with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A)Loans at Home should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss S towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything Loans  at Home has already refunded.
B)Loans at Home should calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by 
Miss S which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss S originally  
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C)Loans at Home should remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Miss S as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans.  If this results in Miss S having  
made overpayments  then Loans  at Home should refund these overpayments  with 8% 
simple interest* calculated  on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Loans at Home should  then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding  loans and any principal Loans at 
Home has already written-off.  If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to 
Miss S. However if there is still an outstanding balance then Loans  at Home should  try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss S. Loans at Home  shouldnt pursue 
outstanding balances made  up of principal you have  already  written-off.
E)Loans at Home should remove any adverse information recorded on Miss S credit  file in 
relation to loan 5. The overall pattern of Miss S borrowing  for loans 6 to 16 means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Loans at Home  should remove these  loans 
entirely from Miss S credit file. Loans  at Home does not have to remove loans 13 to 16 
from Miss S credit file until these have been  repaid, but it should still remove  any adverse 
information recorded about these  loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans at Home to deduct tax from this interest. Loans at 
Home should give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN55572225my final decision
I uphold Miss S complaint in part and S.D. Taylor Limited must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 May 2020.
