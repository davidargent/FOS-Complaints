K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains that Hastings Insurance Services Limited, a broker,  charged  him a fee in 
relation to his motor  insurance policy when he told it about his change  of address. 
 
background
In April 2018 Mr T changed address. Hastings charged Mr T a fee of £25 when he told it 
about the change.  
Mr T says that Hastings is obliged to hold his correct address and that it shouldnt have 
charged him a fee. He also complains about  the level of the fee. Mr T wants  a refund. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think that Hastings had treated Mr T unfairly. He said it told Mr T about 
the fee on renewal  and that the level of the fee wasnt excessive. Mr T didnt agree with the 
adjudicator. He said that the level of the charge is disproportionate and that no bank or other 
insurer charged him a fee for changing his address.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the policy. It says that Hastings  will make administration charge and sets out 
what they are. On balance, Im satisfied that Mr T would have indicated  that he had read and 
understood the policy and the fees when he renewed his policy.  So, I think that Hastings told 
Mr T about the charge in advance.
I dont think that the £25 charge is disproportionate. Hastings will have reasonably  incurred 
costs in providing and maintaining the system  that allows Mr T to update his address  and is 
obliged to record the change internally and report the change  externally. 
I dont think that Hastings acted unreasonably or unfairly in charging  the fee. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2019.
