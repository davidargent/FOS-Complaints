The complaint
 A company which Ill refer to as H complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited provided poor 
service when they added a fraud detection system to its account.  
In bringing this complaint H is represented by its director who I refer to as Mr H.  
 
What happened
 H has a merchant services agreement with WorldPay. WorldPay operated a fraud detection 
system known as their Risk Management Module (RMM) key features of which were 
explained in an e-mail WorldPay sent to H in March 2021. H asked WorldPay if extra 
features could be added so that it would be alerted to certain high-risk transactions. 
WorldPay suggested H contact their fraud team who would be able to customise the settings 
on system to activate the features H wanted. 
Although as suggested, H did contact the fraud team, it didnt respond. However, about a 
week later WorldPay contacted H to say the RMM had been added to its account. But the 
version of the RMM that WorldPay added wasnt customised as H had wanted. It took a 
further two weeks before this was done. In the meantime, certain high-risk transactions were 
processed that would otherwise have been blocked had the customised settings been in 
place.
H complained to WorldPay about the time it took to resolve the issue which it estimated cost 
the company over £1,000 in wasted time. By way of compromise, however, H said it was 
willing to accept £250 as compensation.  
WorldPay said it normally takes between five to ten working days to add the RMM to an 
account. And they believed theyd complied with that time frame when the RMM was added 
to Hs account. But they acknowledged their communication with H was poor because they 
failed to respond to its queries about the RMM and at other times they sent confusing emails 
to H about agreed tariffs for the RMM. So, WorldPay refunded £151.44 worth of charges that 
H incurred for the RMM in March and April before the settings it wanted were put in place. 
They also offered £100 for the inconvenience H experienced because of their poor service. 
H remained dissatisfied, however, and WorldPay were unwilling to offer more. So, H referred 
its complaint to this service. 
Our investigator concluded there was no unreasonable delay by WorldPay when they added 
the RMM to Hs account. But he acknowledged it took a bit longer to put in place the 
customised settings H had wanted all along. He also believed that if, during the period of 
delay WorldPays communication with H had been better, e-mails which H sent to WorldPay 
could have been avoided. Ultimately, however, the investigator was satisfied that having 
refunded the £151.44 in charges plus offering a further £100 for the inconvenience they 
caused, WorldPay had fairly compensated H.  
H didnt accept the investigators conclusions. It didnt think he took sufficient account of the 
40 hours Mr H said he spent dealing with the matter. So, H asked for an ombudsmans 
review. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I agree with the investigators conclusion and for broadly the same reasons. 
Ill explain why.  
 
WorldPay said their timeframe for adding their RMM to an account is five to ten working 
days. And I can see from the email correspondence between H and WorldPay that after Mr 
H contacted their fraud department to confirm H wanted to go ahead with the RMM the 
system was added to its account seven days later. So, WorldPay is right they did comply 
with their timeframe for doing so. 
But WorldPay did not respond to Mr Hs request for someone to contact him so that the 
customise settings H had told WorldPay it wanted could be put in place. That omission 
amounted to poor service and as noted by the investigator it took a further two weeks to put 
things right. The effect was that not only did Mr H have to chase WorldPay and formally 
complain about their poor service, certain high-risk transactions were processed because 
although the RMM was in place it didnt have the bespoke settings that would have 
prevented the transactions. 
I should note, however, that H has not argued it suffered any financial loss arising from the 
processing of the high-risk transactions. Its case is that it should be better compensated for 
the time and effort that were spent dealing with WorldPay to get the RMM functioning with 
the bespoke settings. 
WorldPay have acknowledged their poor service.  And as already noted they refunded the 
£151.44 in charges for March and April which H had incurred before the RMM was fully 
functioning with the settings H wanted incorporated. I think the refund of such charges was 
the fair and reasonable thing to do. Additionally, WorldPay offered £100 for the 
inconvenience caused to H. 
Ive thought about whether the £100 recognises the extent of the inconvenience that 
WorldPays poor service caused to H. Although as the investigator noted Mr H might not 
have sent very many emails during the two-week period when the RMM was in operation 
without the bespoke settings H wanted, nonetheless, they reveal Hs understandable 
frustration at the lack of response from WorldPay to its queries. 
Mr H has said he spent some 40 hours trying to get the RMM issues resolved at a cost to H 
of around £1000. But we wouldnt generally award compensation, based on rates that a 
complainant may charge per hour. Rather we look at the overall impact the error had on the 
complainant. 
Having thought about this carefully, I agree with the investigator a payment of £100 in this 
regard is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
My final decision
   My final decision is that WorldPay (UK) Limited should pay £100 in full and final settlement 
of the complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask H to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2022.
