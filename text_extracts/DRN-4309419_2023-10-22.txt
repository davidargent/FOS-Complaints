The complaint
Mr R complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) wont refund over Â£1.2 million he lost to 
two scams between June 2021 and May 2022. 
What happened
Mr R fell victim to a cryptocurrency investment scam after he was contacted by Group 500 
(the scammer) in June 2022 after registering his interest on their website. 
The scammer instructed him to open various crypto wallets to send money to as part of the 
investment, where the funds were subsequently transferred on to the scammer. Mr R made 
the following payments from his HSBC account as part of the scam, either as part of the 
investment, or towards taxes and commission he was told he had to pay in order to access 
his profits:

Mr R realised he had been scammed after the brokers website and trading platform 
disappeared and he couldnt get in contact with anyone. In an attempt to try and recover his 
money, Mr R researched companies that could help recover financial losses. He found a 
company called Spright Vestige (the second scammer) who said they would be able to 
recover his money from Group 500. 
Mr R was told he would have to pay an advanced fee for the companys services, as well as 
several other payments for things like decrypting his trading wallet and verifying his account. 
The second scammer instructed him to open another crypto wallet and he preceded to make 
the following payments from his HSBC account:

16/05/2022 Doris DAX MT Limited 2,750 Transfer
After making these payments, Mr R was told that he wouldnt be able to withdraw his funds 
as they had come from a fraudulent address. He realised he had been scammed again after 
he was told he would need to invest 10% of the value of the funds in order to clean the 
wallet. He reported both scams to HSBC on 25 May 2022.
HSBC refused to refund any of the payments Mr R had lost to the scam. It said that it had 
spoken to Mr R in relation to several payments throughout the scam but that he had misled 
the bank as to their true nature. So, HSBC said that any further intervention it could have 
made would have made no difference in the prevention of the scam.
HSBC acknowledged that four payments Mr R made as part of the scam (to KN International 
and DS Keels Trading) were made to another person, and to a UK account, such that they 
would be covered by the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM Code). However, it didnt 
consider Mr R had a reasonable basis for believing the payments to be genuine. So, it said 
he wouldnt be eligible for a refund. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint in part. He didnt think HSBC was liable to refund any 
of the payments that were not covered under the CRM Code as Mr R had misled the bank 
when it asked him about the payments. So, he didnt think any further or earlier intervention 
would have likely revealed the scam. However, in terms of the four payments covered under 
the CRM Code, the investigator thought that HSBC should refund 50%. He didnt think that 
Mr R had a reasonable basis for believing the payments to be genuine, but also said that HSBC hadnt shown that it had provided an effective warning in line with its own obligations 
under the Code. 
HSBC accepted the investigators findings and agreed to settle the complaint by reimbursing 
50% of the payments covered under the CRM Code. Mr R disagreed. He thought that 
HSBCs intervention didnt go far enough and that it had missed an opportunity to prevent 
the scam when it spoke to him. As Mr R didnt agree, the matter has been escalated to me to 
determine. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im satisfied that HSBCs offer to settle the complaint is fair and Im not 
persuaded it would have to compensate Mr R any further. Ill explain why. 
It isnt in dispute that Mr R has fallen victim to two cruel scams here, nor that he authorised 
the disputed payments he made from his HSBC account. The payments were requested by 
him using his legitimate security credentials provided by HSBC, and the starting position is 
that banks ought to follow the instructions given by their customers in order for legitimate 
payments to be made as instructed. But Ive considered whether there is any fair and 
reasonable basis for HSBC to reimburse any of the payments.
Payments not covered under the CRM Code
The vast majority of payments Mr R made as part of the scam unfortunately do not fall within 
the scope of the CRM Code for reimbursement. These include any card payments he made, 
as well as any bank transfers to his own crypto wallets (as the Code only applies where 
money is transferred to another person). 
However, Ive considered whether HSBC should have done more to prevent Mr R from 
falling victim to the scam outside its obligations under the CRM Code, as there are some 
situations in which a bank should reasonably have had a closer look at the circumstances 
surrounding a particular transfer. For example, if it was particularly out of character.
Its common ground that some of the payments were considered unusual given that they did 
trigger the banks fraud prevention systems and were automatically blocked pending further 
enquiry, including those made on 1 October 2021, and also on 4 and 7 January 2022. 
Accordingly, its just a question of whether the bank went far enough in all the circumstances 
with its interventions.
Having listened to the call recordings of the occasions HSBC spoke to Mr R, I accept that it 
sometimes could have gone further in its questioning, and that there also may have been 
cause to intervene earlier. But even accepting this as the case, on balance, Im not 
persuaded that any further questioning or earlier intervention would have ultimately 
uncovered the scam and prevented the loss. 
I say this because Mr R said he had been told by the scammer to mislead the bank, and they 
had coached him on what to say if he was asked any questions. This was an issue which 
HSBC specifically warned about in a call on 7 January 2022. And I can see that when HSBC 
asked him about the nature of the payments on 4 January 2022, he did not say he was 
investing, and instead misled the bank and told it the payment was to set up a travel card for 
foreign currency to use abroad. HSBC also specifically asked Mr R if the payments were to 
fund investment trades in a phone call on 9 January 2022, which he denied and continued to maintain it was just currency exchange. 
It was based upon the answers Mr R gave that the bank was satisfied the payment wasnt 
likely being made as part of a scam. If he had answered the questions accurately and said 
he was in contact with a third-party broker and was investing in cryptocurrency, then I accept 
it would have been incumbent on HSBC to maintain suspicion about the payment and probe 
further into the circumstances. But seeing as Mr R was not forthcoming with these details, I 
dont think any further probing from HSBC would have likely revealed that he was being 
scammed. 
I also note that when HSBC spoke to Mr R on 4 January 2022, it asked him if he had 
checked the FCA register to look up the company he said he was paying. He said that he 
hadnt but that he was willing to take the risk. So, even if Mr R had been honest about the 
nature of the payment he was making, any warning HSBC could have given him to do further 
research would have been unlikely to reveal the scam either.
So, in these circumstances, I dont consider it would be fair and reasonable to hold HSBC 
liable for Mr Rs losses that are not covered by the CRM Code, because it seems more likely 
than not that he would have always made the payment to the scammers, notwithstanding 
any intervention made by the bank.
In terms of the second scam Mr R fell victim to, I dont consider there was any cause for 
HSBC to have intervened in these payments. They were going to a payee Mr R had paid 
before, and the amounts were not out of character when compared with his normal 
spending. So, I dont think HSBC can fairly be held liable for these payments either. 
Payments covered under the CRM Code
As Ive outlined above, four payments Mr R made as part of the scam would fall in scope for 
reimbursement under the CRM Code:
3 January 2022 - Â£20,000 to KN International 
7 January 2022 - Â£14,950 to KN International
12 January 2022 - Â£15,400 to KN International
13 January 2022 - Â£24,900 to D Skeels Trading 
HSBC has accepted that it did not provide an effective warning when Mr R was making 
these payments and has therefore agreed to reimburse 50% in line with the Code. As such, I 
do not intend exploring this point any further given it is no longer in dispute. What does 
remain in dispute, however, is whether Mr R had a reasonable basis for believing the 
payments he was making were genuine or going towards a legitimate investment. 
Having considered the evidence, Im not persuaded Mr R had such a reasonable basis of 
belief for the following reasons: 
Despite having previously made all his transfers directly to his crypto wallets, Mr R was 
instead asked to send money directly to other UK accounts. He says he was told that 
they were crypto brokers who would exchange the sterling to Bitcoin. Mr R has 
acknowledged that this was an odd request and I also think it ought to have given him 
cause for concern. There was no reason for him to have to suddenly start sending his 
money to a broker to exchange it to Bitcoin when he already had several crypto accounts 
where he could do this himself. There is also nothing to suggest that the companies he was paying even offered such services, and neither was there any clear connection 
between these companies and Group 500 either.
Mr R was told by the scammer to mislead the bank if he was questioned about the 
payments. If it was a legitimate investment being made through a legitimate broker, there 
would have been no reason for him to mislead the bank as to the purpose of the 
payment. And I think this ought to have given him cause for concern that something was 
not right.  
By the time Mr R came to make these payments in January 2022, He was under the 
impression that he had made Â£2.87Million, which would have represented an increase of 
over 300% in his trading account value. While I understand some people have made a 
lot of money from cryptocurrency, such returns should have still appeared wholly 
unrealistic and far too good to be true.
Mr R was told by the scammer that they were upgrading his account to the Millionaires 
Club, which would give him 70% insurance against any future losses. Again, being told 
that he would have his investment losses indemnified to such an extent should have 
appeared too good to be true. The scammers were also misspelling well-known names 
such as Goldman Sacs in their correspondence with Mr R when discussing this.
The scammer told Mr R there had been a crash in the market, prompting him to 
desperately invest over Â£250,000 in October to recoup his losses. However, there are no 
signs of any crash in Bitcoin value during this period, so it appears he did not do enough 
research to independently verify what he was being told by the scammer, where he could 
have easily discovered he was being misled.
So, Im satisfied there was enough going on at the point Mr R was making these payments 
that should have given him significant cause for concern that something simply wasnt right. 
Therefore, Im not persuaded he had a reasonable basis for believing the payments were 
genuine and I dont think HSBC needs to pay anything over and above the 50% it has 
already agreed to reimburse. 
Recovery
Ive also thought about whether HSBC could have done more to recover the funds Mr R lost. 
In terms of the payments covered under the Code, I can see that HSBC reached out to the 
beneficiary banks but was unable to recover any funds, which isnt surprising given the 
amount of time that had passed between the payment being made and the fraud being 
reported.
In terms of the faster payments made to Mr Rs own crypto accounts, there would have been 
no prospect of recovering these funds either given we know they were subsequently 
transferred on to the scammer from those accounts. And finally, with regards to the debit 
card transactions, there would have been no reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim 
succeeding given Mr R would have received the asset he paid for (i.e. cryptocurrency). So, 
Im not persuaded there was anything more HSBC could have done to recover the funds in 
these circumstances.
I appreciate this will likely come as a disappointment to Mr R, and Im sorry he has been the 
victim of such a cruel scam. I do not underestimate the impact this must have had on him. 
However, for the reasons given above, I dont think HSBC can fairly or reasonably be 
expected to reimburse anything over and above what it has already agreed. My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct HSBC UK Bank Plc to:
Refund 50% of the payments Mr R made that Ive listed above as being covered by 
the CRM Code.
Mr R funded these scam payments via directors loans from his company account. 
He has not been able to provide evidence to demonstrate what rate of interest, if any, 
would be payable on these loans, so I will not be asking HSBC to pay any interest on 
this award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2023.
