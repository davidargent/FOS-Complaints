The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as T, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
NatWest) closed its business current account (BCA) and Bounce Back Loan (BBL) 
without any notice. 
Ts complaint is brought to this service by one of its directors, whom Ill refer to as Mr K.
What happened
Mr K noticed that he could no longer access Ts BCA or BBL. When he contacted NatWest 
about this, he was told the accounts had been moved to NatWests collections and 
recoveries department because the BBL had fallen into arrears and because payments 
hadnt been made to clear those arrears, despite NatWest contacting T about them. Mr K 
wasnt happy about this, especially as he hadnt received any contact from NatWest about 
the position of Ts BBL account. So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Ts complaint. They explained theyd made several attempts to contact T 
about the arrears on the BBL account, but without success. As such, NatWest didnt feel 
theyd acted unfairly by moving Ts accounts to their recoveries department when they had. 
Mr K wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred Ts complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation. Mr K remained dissatisfied, so the matter was 
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, it seems evident that the reason Mr K didnt receive any of the letters, text 
messages, telephone calls, or emails that NatWest sent to T to advise that payments had 
been missed on the BBL account and that the account was in a position of arrears which 
needed to be cleared, was because the contact details for T that NatWest held hadnt been 
kept up to date by Ts directors.
Ts BBL account statements confirm that several loan payments werent made by T. So, Im 
satisfied that the BBL account did fall into a position of arrears. And Ts BBL statements also 
confirm that no payments were made towards Ts BBL account to clear those arrears.
Its therefore difficult to conclude that NatWest have done anything wrong here. I say this 
because it was the responsibility of Ts directors to have monitored Ts accounts, including 
the BBL account, and to have been aware of any payments towards the BBL that may have 
been missed. In short, this means Ts directors should have been aware that Ts BBL had 
fallen into a position of arrears, regardless of whether any notice or correspondence about 
these arrears was received from NatWest or not. 
As it happens, NatWest did attempt to contact T about the arrears on the BBL account via 
several different channels. But NatWests attempts to contact T were unsuccessful because 
they were made to contact details that were no longer valid for T. This isnt NatWests fault, 
and it was the responsibility of Ts directors to have maintained accurate and up to date 
contact details for T with NatWest. 
Mr K has explained that NatWest appear to have two different sets of contact details for T 
and have used the incorrect set. But NatWest have demonstrated that the alternative set of 
contact details Mr K refers to here are his own personal contact details, which Mr K has kept 
up to date on his personal accounts. 
But it doesnt follow that because Mr K updated his personal contact details that NatWest 
would also update the contact details they hold for T. This is because Mr K and T are 
separate entities. As such, I remain satisfied that the responsibility for ensuring that the 
contact details NatWest held for T were correct sat with Ts directors.
Ultimately, it was the responsibility of Ts directors to have been aware that payments to the 
BBL had been missed and to have kept Ts contact details updated correctly with NatWest. 
And, given that neither of these things appears to have happened, I dont feel that NatWest 
have acted unfairly by following the process here that they have. 
This is because payments were missed on Ts BBL account so that the account fell into 
arrears which then prompted NatWests account arrears process. And Im satisfied NatWest, 
as part of that process, did attempt to contact T about the arrears on the BBL on multiple 
occasions and via several different channels, as would be fairly expected. Finally, given that 
T didnt clear the arrears present on the BBL, Im satisfied that the loan was then fairly 
terminated by NatWest in line with terms of the BBL agreement. 
Mr K also feels that Ts BCA was closed by NatWest without any notice being given. But Im 
satisfied that NatWest did send a letter to T which gave T 60 days notice of their intention to 
close its BCA  but because Ts contact details hadnt been correctly maintained by Mr K, 
this letter also wasnt received. Once again, I dont feel that this was NatWests fault  for the 
reasons previously explained  and so I wont be upholding this aspect of Ts complaint.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr K was wanting, but it follows that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I trust that Mr K will 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
