The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (Natwest) blocked and closed his 
accounts, then delayed retuning his account balances to him. He also says he was given 
misinformation and was put to distress and inconvenience by Natwest.
To put things right, Mr B wants NatWest to pay him compensation.
What happened
On 22 July 2019, NatWest blocked Mr Bs accounts while it carried out a review.
There was a total balance of £40,043.04, which was frozen while the review was carried out. 
On 23 July 2019, NatWest wrote to Mr B to say it would be closing his accounts in 14 days. 
It invited Mr B to complete a funds release form or attend a branch in order to have the funds 
in his account returned. It warned him that it could take 28 to 60 days to complete necessary 
checks before the funds were returned.
Mr B complained. He said he was told his direct debits would still be processed, but that they 
had failed, and that the branch sent him away when he tried to attend to recover his funds. 
He said he was struggling financially and needed the money in his accounts.
On 7 August 2019, NatWest issued its final response to Mr Bs complaint. It said it was 
entitled to block and close his accounts, and that it couldnt release his account balance, 
save for £1,861.92, which was Mr Bs salary payment. It said it should have an answer 
regarding his remaining funds within 60 days.
Mr B rejected NatWests response and brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator 
looked at the complaint and felt NatWest was entitled to block and close Mr Bs account in 
the manner it had. But she thought NatWest had taken too long to complete its investigation. 
So, she told NatWest it should pay Mr B a total of £400 in compensation, plus interest at the 
rate of 8% on the money in Mr Bs accounts, from 1 September when she felt it couldve 
completed its review.
Both NatWest and Mr B agreed with the outcome, so NatWest made a payment to Mr B in 
the sum of £603.81. But when Mr B received the payment, he questioned NatWests interest 
calculation, saying 8% of £40,043.04 was £3,206.49 and 8% of £1,861.92 was £148.95. Our 
investigator didnt agree with Mr Bs calculation, so the matter came to me to issue a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account  which both NatWest and Mr B had to comply with 
 set out the circumstances in which NatWest can close accounts. Having considered the 
evidence Ive been provided, Im satisfied that NatWest acted in accordance with its terms 
and conditions when it closed Mr Bs accounts.
Account block
Im satisfied NatWest acted in accordance with its legal and regulatory obligations when it 
blocked and reviewed Mr Bs accounts. And that it was entitled to review the accounts under 
the account terms and conditions. So, I cant say it acted unfairly in doing so. 
But I do think it could have released Mr Bs funds more quickly. Our investigator set out a 
helpful timeline of events and dates that show what was happening while the account was 
blocked. And, having looked at the evidence, it seems to me that NatWest had received all 
the information it needed to complete its review by 20 August 2019. 
NatWest did tell Mr B that it might take up to 60 days to complete its investigation. And I 
think its reasonable in the circumstances of this particular case for NatWest to take a short 
period to complete its review, once it had received the final information. But I agree with our 
investigator that it should have completed its review by 1 September 2019. So, I think its fair 
that NatWest should pay Mr B interest on the balance it held from 1 September 2019 to 8 
October 2019. And Ill comment below on whether or not I think it has enough in that regard.
Further, I havent seen any justification to explain why Mr B wasnt able to withdraw his 
salary funds of £1,861.92 sooner than he did. Mr B was advised to attend branch to collect 
his salary on 25 July 2019, but he didnt withdraw them until 28 August 2019. And I agree 
with the reasons our investigator set out in her opinion, NatWest should pay Mr B interest on 
those funds from 25 July 2019 to 28 August 2019. Again, Ill comment below on whether or 
not NatWest has paid Mr B the correct amount.
Further compensation
There seems to be some confusion about the status of Mr Bs direct debits. He says he was 
told they would continue, but that some were returned. When an account is blocked, I would 
usually expect direct debits to be returned, so I cant say NatWest acted unfairly if any of the 
direct debits were blocked. Although our investigator asked Mr B to provide evidence to 
support this element of his complaint, and he hasnt done so.  But I accept there was some 
confusion around this point.
Mr B was also charged account fees after he was served notice that the accounts would be 
closed. Mr B didnt have access to his accounts during that time, and they were closed 
shortly after. So, I think its fair that NatWest should refund these fees.
Finally, Mr B says NatWest should have to pay him compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience he experienced during the time the account was blocked. He says he was 
unable to enjoy a holiday he took during the block, and that he had to borrow money from 
family and friends.
Given Ive said NatWest was entitled to block and close Mr Bs account, and that it was 
reasonable for the account to remain blocked for at least part of the time it was, I think Mr B 
would have experienced a level of distress regardless of whether NatWest had caused any unnecessary delays. And I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest to refund the cost of Mr 
Bs flight, which is what Mr B has asked for.
But with that being said, Im satisfied that there was a degree of misinformation on 
NatWests part. And I accept that would have caused Mr B trouble and upset. NatWest has 
paid Mr B £400 in that regard and Im satisfied that, in doing so, it has done enough to put 
things right for him.
As to the interest calculation, Ive checked the sums NatWest carried out and I agree they 
reflect the suggested award from our investigator. Mr Bs calculations represented 8% for a 
full year, but our investigator had suggested 8% interest per annum for the period NatWest 
unfairly blocked Mr Bs account. Which is the correct calculation. 
As it is entitled to do, NatWest did deduct income tax from Mr Bs interest award. It has told 
Mr B how much tax it has deducted and Mr B can ask NatWest to give him a tax deduction 
certificate if he needs one to reclaim the tax from HMRC, if appropriate.
NatWest has paid Mr B a fair amount of interest, representing the period it unnecessarily 
held onto his money. Its also refunded the charges he incurred after the account was 
blocked and paid him £400 in compensation. Having considered everything both parties 
have said, Im satisfied NatWest has complied with our investigators recommendations and I 
think NatWest has done enough to put things right for Mr B. 
My final decision
My final decision is that Im not going to ask NatWest to do anything further to put things 
right for Mr B. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 March 2021.
