Complaint
Mr S has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable and were therefore 
irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr S with a loan for £1,750.00 in April 2019. This loan had an APR 
of 44.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£2,549.28, including interest, fees and charges of £799.28, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just over £105. This loan was settled with some of the proceeds from 
loan 2.
118 118 Money then provided Mr S with a second loan for £2,387.63 (£1,287.63 went 
towards settling the outstanding balance on loan 1) in February 2020. This loan had an APR 
of 44.9% and a term of 18 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£3,456.72, including interest, fees and charges of £1,069.09, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just under £145. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr S complaint and he thought that 118 118 Money ought 
to have realised that it shouldnt have provided Mr S with his loans. So he thought that Mr S 
complaint should be upheld. 
118 118 Money didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr S complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mr S complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr S could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
Given what it may consider to be the relatively low monthly repayments due on these loans, I 
can understand why 118 118 Money may believe that a relatively light touch assessment of 
affordability would have been proportionate given the circumstances here.
However, Im concerned that 118 118 Moneys own checks showed that Mr S was already 
significantly indebted and a significant proportion of his monthly income was already being 
taken up by repayments to existing credit commitments. Furthermore, the credit checks also 
showed that Mr S indebtedness had increased between the applications for loans 1 and 2. I 
think that 118 118 Money ought to have been concerned as to why Mr S had an apparent 
want or need for so much credit in a relatively short period of time. 
All of this leaves me persuaded by what Mr S has said about already being in a difficult 
financial position at the time. And while its possible Mr S financial position reflected his 
choices rather than financial difficulty, Id add that my experience of these types of cases 
suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 
118 Money, Ive been persuaded to accept Mr S version of events here. 
As this is the case, I do think that Mr S existing financial position meant that he was unlikely 
to be able to afford the repayments to these loans, without undue difficulty or borrowing 
further. And Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more like than not 
have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided these loans to Mr S. As 118 118 
Money provided Mr S with these loans, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to act fairly 
and reasonably towards him. 
Mr S ended up paying and is still being expected to pay interest, fees and charges on loans 
he shouldnt have been provided with. So Im satisfied that Mr S lost out because of what 
118 118 Money did wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr S
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr S by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr S paid on loan 1;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr S to the date of settlement
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 2 from the outset. The 
payments Mr S made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £2,387.63  originally lent. If 
Mr S has already paid more than £2,387.63 on loan 2 then 118 118 Money should 
treat any extra as overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to             
Mr S;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Mr S to the date of settlement
removing any and all adverse information it recorded about loan 1 from Mr S credit 
file. If no outstanding balance remains on loan 2 after all adjustments have been made, all adverse information 118 118 Money recorded about loan 2 should also be 
removed from Mr S credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr S complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2023.
