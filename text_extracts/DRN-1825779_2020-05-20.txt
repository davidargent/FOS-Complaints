The complaint
Mr E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and then closed his account. 
He says this caused him trouble and upset. He wants NatWest to pay him compensation and 
tell him why his account was blocked.
What happened
Mr E had a current account with NatWest.
In April 2019, NatWest decided to review Mr Es account. Whilst it completed its review the 
bank restricted Mr Es account. This meant Mr E wasnt able to use his account. NatWest 
removed the block on 1 May 2019 and allowed Mr E access to his account. Following its 
review NatWest decided to close Mr Es account on 2 May 2019 and gave him 60 days 
notice to make other banking arrangements.
Mr E complained to NatWest. He said he hadnt done anything which wouldve caused the 
bank to block and close his account. And pointed out that hed been a good customer for a 
number of years. So, it was unfair for the bank to restrict and close his account.
Mr E says because of the block he wasnt able to pay for everyday expenses and was forced 
to borrow money from friends. Hes said when he called NatWest to try and find out what 
was happening the bank wouldnt give him any information, which made him very anxious 
and impacted his mental wellbeing. Hes also unhappy that he didnt receive a letter from 
NatWest about the closure of his account until some time after it was dated.
NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed Mr Es account. And had done 
so in order to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations. The bank also said it had 
closed Mr Es account in line with the terms and conditions. 
NatWest apologised for the service it provided Mr E when he rang the bank to find out what 
was happening with his account. In particular, it said it disconnected his call instead of 
putting him through to the banks fraud department. And for telling him telling Mr E that he 
would receive a closure letter sooner than he did when he called the bank. And for 
disconnecting his call instead of putting him through to the fraud department when Mr E rung 
the bank on 18 April 2019 about his account. And telling him a letter had been sent to him 
about his account being closed. Mr E wasnt happy with this response. He said NatWest 
have breached its contract with him and made him feel like a criminal.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Es complaint. He said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had reviewed and closed Mr Es account. Mr E disagreed. He says 
NatWest treated him unfairly and didnt give him any information.   
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Its clear from what Mr E has told us and the bank that he feels strongly about his complaint. 
I appreciate that hes upset that NatWest blocked his account and that this caused him 
inconvenience. I can also understand that this was no doubt stressful for him especially as at 
the time he was studying. But for me to uphold this complaint, I must be satisfied that the 
bank has done something wrong. And in this case, I dont think it has. Ill explain why. 
All banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. Banks are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of 
an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to restrict customers 
accounts. NatWest has said that Mr Es access to his accounts was blocked to meet these 
requirements.
Im satisfied first of all that NatWest was within its rights to review Mr Es account and that it 
was entitled to block it while it carried out that review. NatWest also werent obliged to tell Mr 
E why it was carrying out a review of his account  as much as hed like to know. And it 
wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so. The terms and conditions also permit 
NatWest to review an account.
The timing of NatWests actions was unfortunate. Mr E has explained he was studying and 
had to rely on friends for money. And I can appreciate that it would have been embarrassing 
for Mr E to ask others to lend him money for food. So, I can understand why he found this 
experience with NatWest stressful and upsetting.
But as Ive already explained banks have a legal obligation to comply with various laws and 
regulations. Having looked at all the information, Im satisfied that NatWest was complying 
with its obligations when it blocked and reviewed Mr Es account. I can see that NatWest 
completed its review within 12 days, which I dont consider unreasonable and Im satisfied 
that this was done in a timely manner. So, whilst I accept this caused Mr E inconvenience, I 
cant say NatWest has treated him unfairly when it blocked his account.
The terms and conditions of the account  which both NatWest and Mr E had to comply 
with say that it could close the account by giving him 60 days notice. And sooner in certain 
circumstances. NatWest has done this. I can see that NatWest wrote to Mr E on 2 May 2019 
to let him know he needed to make alternative banking arrangements. So, its entitled to 
close the account as it seems its already done. In other words, there has been no breach of 
contract, as Mr E has suggested, because NatWest has acted in accordance with the 
account terms and conditions.
Mr E has argued that he didnt receive the notice to closure letter on 2 May 2019, which was 
the date of the letter. He says he got the letter after this date. I think Mr E is saying NatWest 
ought to have informed him much quicker about how he could access the money in his 
account. NatWest has explained that its process for when it decides to close an account isnt 
to call consumers to explain what is happening. It says this is all done by post, and a letter is 
sent out explaining that an account is to be closed on a certain date and the customer needs 
to make alternative banking arrangements. And this is consistent with what happened here.
NatWest has provided me with a screen shot showing that the closure letter was posted out 
to Mr Es address on 2 May 2019. So, Im satisfied it was sent on this date. I can also see 
from NatWests final response letter, that the bank let Mr E know hed receive the letter 
within 2-3 days of 2 May 2019, which I dont find unreasonable given the letter was being 
sent to Mr E by post as its usual for any letters sent by post to take a few days to reach their 
destinations. So, I dont think NatWest treated Mr E unfairly.
Mr Es also unhappy about the service he received when he called NatWest about his 
account. NatWest has accepted that a call it had with Mr E on 18 April 2019 didnt go as it shouldve. And has said that instead of Mr Es call being disconnected it should put Mr E 
through to the department who deal with account closures. NatWest has also accepted that 
on 18 April 2019 it shouldnt have told Mr E it had sent him a letter about his account closure 
because it hadnt yet been dispatched. And this wasnt done until 2 May 2019. NatWest has 
already apologised to Mr E for any trouble upset this caused. I think this is a fair and 
reasonable way to resolve this aspect of Mr Es complaint. So, Im not going to ask NatWest 
to do anything more.
In summary, I appreciate of course, that NatWest actions caused Mr E stress and 
inconvenience. So, I realise Mr E will be disappointed by my decision. But it wouldnt be 
appropriate to make an award of compensation for that, since I dont believe NatWest acted 
inappropriately when it blocked and closed Mr Es account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2020.
