K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains about the short term loans  he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr T says that QuickQuid didnt  perform adequate affordability checks. He thinks 
that if it had then it wouldnt have lent to him as he couldnt afford  to make the repayments. 
background
Mr T took out ten payday loans between  May 2015  and August 2018. Some  of the loans had 
more than one repayment. The first repayment was lower followed by a second larger  one. 
Some of the information QuickQuid has given  us is shown in the table  at the end of this 
decision.
QuickQuid has looked at Mr Ts complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr Ts declared monthly  income. It also didnt think that he was 
dependent on short term lending and Mr T didnt  notify it that he was in financial difficulty. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and recommended  that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 6 to 6c and 9a to 10b. QuickQuid didnt  agree  
with this recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman,  for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Ts complaint. Having reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr T loans 6 to 6c and 
9a to 10b. Ill explain why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr T and QuickQuid said.  He thought Mr Ts 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that it had made  proportionate checks  for 
loans 1 to 4, 7, 8 and 9. So he thought that QuickQuids decisions to lend for these loans 
were reasonable. 
He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 4a to 6c and loans 
9a to 10b. He thought  if it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr T money for loans 6 to 
6c and 9a to 10b. This is because he didnt think that Mr T could afford  the repayments. And 
QuickQuid wouldve seen  this had it completed  better checks. 
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
Ref: DRN94625682Thank you for providing your assessment of Mr Ts complaint. I have reviewed  your 
recommendations to resolve Mr Ts case. However, we are unable to agree  that he should 
not have been provided with loans 6-10 based  on the enhanced checks performed prior to 
approving these loans. Please note that in CashEuroNet UKs initial response to FOS we 
provided detailed  information indicating why these loans  were  responsibly lent to Mr T. I 
have now attached the entire lending process  including all the checks  that we perform prior 
to lending, the screenshots of customer applications  as well as the sample 
acknowledgement from the contract that customers have to check  when their repayment 
amount is greater than their estimated disposable income
QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its business submissions  to us in which  it said:
We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June 2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March,  2015 before Mr T borrowed 
his first loan,  QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the 
FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We 
confirm that this assessment was conducted  properly  and individually  for each of these 
loans
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.
And this response  didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. My decision will focus 
on the specifics of Mr Ts complaint and what both parties have said about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr T borrowed  the loans in question.  Bearing  in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Ts complaint. Mr T didnt disagree with our adjudicators  
opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 5a and 7 to 9. Because of this I dont think there  is any 
ongoing disagreement about these  loans. So I wont be making a decision about  this 
lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr T had with QuickQuid. So they 
are something Ive taken  into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
And just to be clear, as my table shows, there were large breaks  in the lending  between 
loans 2 and 3 and loans  6c and 7. So it was reasonable for QuickQuid to assume that Mr Ts 
finances had improved and to treat loans 3 and 7 as new lending chains. 
Ref: DRN94625683QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Ts monthly income as being £1,600  for loans  1 and 2, £1,780 for 
loans 3 to 5a and £1,830  for the rest of the lending 
it recorded his monthly expenditure as £525 for the first three  loans and £475 for the 
remainder
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reports to adjust the amounts 
Mr T had provided to calculate what it called his estimated disposable income
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 6 to 6c and 9a to 
10b
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Mr T have provided and what  both sides 
have said. 
By the time Mr T had taken loan 6 he had been borrowing from QuickQuid, in this chain of 
lending, for just under 7 months. And whilst the loan amounts werent  always  high he had 
increased loans  4 and 5 once which means this was the sixth separate lending  decision that 
QuickQuid had made over this time.  
So I think QuickQuid couldve realised at that time that Mr T may have some  longer term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans  to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. QuickQuid shouldve also become  concerned  about  whether it knew  enough about 
Mr Ts true financial situation.
As I said,  there  was a break  of a year between loans  6c and 7 so its fair that QuickQuid 
thought of Mr T as a new customer.  But Mr T took a number of loans very quickly. Loan  9a 
was the fourth lending  in under month.  And the amounts approved,  for loan 9, were very 
high. Mr T borrowed £750  over two days. Overall QuickQuid approved seven loans, and 
increases to loans,  in around six weeks. So again  this says to me that QuickQuid shouldve  
been concerned  that Mr T was in financial difficulty.   
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to make a full review of Mr Ts finances before 
approving loans 6 to 6c and loans 9a to 10b. And I think that QuickQuid needed to verify this 
information as far as possible. This was to make  sure Mr T was in position to make the 
repayments sustainably.
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all of QuickQuids  credit checks, it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Ts disposable income  (his EDI). This is lower than deducting Mr Ts 
declared expenditure from his declared income  for these  loans.  I dont know  exactly  how 
QuickQuid calculated Mr Ts EDI  but it has said that credit checks are one relevant factor.
But because I dont  know how QuickQuid actually  worked out the EDI, I cant say this 
reflects a proportionate check. QuickQuid  doesnt seem to have fully reviewed Mr Ts 
finances. So I need to think about what its likely  proportionate checks  wouldve shown  
QuickQuid if it had.
Ref: DRN94625684what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown for loans  6 to 6c and 
9a to 10b
Mr T has provided  some information about his financial  circumstances this includes a recent 
credit report  and his bank statements. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  its likely to have found out similar  information  if it had 
made proportionate  checks, so I think its reasonable  to rely on it.
This shows that the amount  Mr T received  as income wasnt  too far away from what  
QuickQuid recorded  it to be at just over £1,800. But Mr Ts expenditure was higher than 
QuickQuid recorded.  His regular expenditure on things such  as rent, food and other  
household bills was over £800,  with rent and transport costs being  £600 of this. He also had 
significant other regular financial commitments. These varied but they were  at least £200 
(before loan 6) to over £1,000 (before  loan 9a)
And by this stage, proportionate checks wouldve also shown  that Mr T was also borrowing  
and repaying significant  amounts to two or three other short  term lenders. He was taking a 
mixture of payday and instalment loans. And he seemed to be borrowing and repaying 
around £750 a month. 
So I think its reasonable to say that Mr Ts expenditure was either very close  to, or above, 
his monthly income  before he borrowed from QuickQuid. 
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr T wouldnt have been able repay these 
loans in a sustainable way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt  have given loans 6 to 6c and 
9a to 10b. And I think hes lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding Mr Ts complaint 
about loans 6 to 6c and 9a to 10b. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr T, QuickQuid should:
refund  all the interest and charges applied as a result of loans 6 to 6c and 9a to 10b; 
and
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were,  to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ts credit file about   these  loans;
If Mr T still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan, 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr T went to towards 
the principal. But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make sure that Mr T doesnt  repay  more  
than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr T hasnt repaid the principal  he borrowed  QuickQuid can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr T has already paid enough  to repay  the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
Ref: DRN94625685And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr T.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2019.
