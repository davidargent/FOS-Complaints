K821x#15complaint
Mr E complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly kept a hold on money in his 
account.
background
Mr E sold an item through the internet  but the buyer  said they hadnt received it. PayPal put 
a hold on the release of Mr Es money  and so he gave it proof of postage. He didnt hear 
anything and so more than a week later he phoned  PayPal. When  he eventually  managed  to 
speak to someone they told him the case had been  resolved  the week before but it hadnt  
removed the hold. When he complained PayPal offered him £20. He didnt  think  this was 
enough.
PayPal said that on 13 August  2018  a payment was made into Mr Es account.  But an issue 
arose about the delivery and so it asked Mr E for proof of postage.  He supplied this on 15 
August.2018. It said the case was closed in his favour that day and that was communicated  
to him. It said the funds  were released from hold on that date but due to a system  latency  
issue, the amount  did not reflect on Mr Es balance until 25 August 2018. It said the 
increased payment  hold timeframe was an unfortunate  inconvenience  to him but it felt the 
amount offered previously was sufficient.
The adjudicator could see that PayPal  had delayed the release of the funds by 10 days. So 
he thought PayPal should pay Mr E £70 for the impact this had on him.
Mr E agreed with this. But PayPal  said it didnt agree with the basis on which  the amount of 
compensation had been  decided. It said it thought £20 as a gesture of goodwill was fair. 
  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Mr E provided evidence about  a disputed transaction to PayPal on 15 August 2018.  It 
accepted that evidence  but a system error  meant  that it didnt return the funds to Mr Es 
account until 10 days later when he phoned  PayPal  to find out what had happened.  
After waiting 10 days Mr E spent a long time on the phone trying to get through  to someone  
who could tell him what had happened  to his money. If PayPal had returned the funds to his 
account when  it closed the case in his favour Mr E wouldnt  have  been  put to that trouble. 
And he wouldnt have  been worried about the whereabouts of his money.  
In those circumstances I dont think £20 is sufficient to compensate  for the impact this has 
had on Mr E. I think £70 for the upset and inconvenience this has caused  him is fair and 
reasonable. 
PayPal has raised an issue about  the chargeable nature of this complaint. That is not an 
issue I can deal with but I can see the adjudicator has explained to it how it can take this 
forward.
