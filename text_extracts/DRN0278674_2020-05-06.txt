K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains about the amount  that hes been charged by Hitachi Capital (UK) plc, trading  
as Hitachi Capital Vehicle Solutions, for damage  to a car that was used by his ex-wife  when 
it was returned  at the end of his hire agreement.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B had been hiring a car from Hitachi  Capital and was required to allow his ex-wife  
to continue to use it so he signed an agreement  modifying a hire agreement  in June 
2015;
he says that hed agreed  with Hitachi Capital that his ex-wife was responsible for 
everything other than the monthly rentals which he continued to pay  but that wasnt 
reflected in the modifying  agreement,  Hitachi Capital  had no agreement with Mr Bs 
ex-wife, Mr B continued to pay for the hire of the car and I consider that he was 
responsible to it for the use of the car;
the car was collected from his ex-wife in August 2016 and, when it was inspected  by 
a third party on behalf of Hitachi Capital, damage to the car with a value of £737.88 
was identified;
Hitachi Capital charged  him a total of £450  because all four alloy wheels were 
scuffed, the right quarter panel was dented and the right rear door was scratched and 
it also charged him for rental  arrears  of £748.78  and £243.49 for a tyre repair  earlier 
in August 2018;
the original hire agreement, which was signed by Mr B in June 2012, said:  Upon 
return of the vehicle you will need to comply with return  conditions  as attached if 
you do not return the vehicle in the required condition you will need to pay us any 
costs we incur so that it complies with the vehicle return conditions   so although 
Mr B had hired the car for more than fours years  hed agreed to be return it in 
accordance with the vehicle return conditions;
Mr B says that Hitachi Capital was made  aware that he could no longer be held 
responsible for the condition of the car and, if hed known that he was liable  for the 
damage, he would  have  been able to attend  the handover which  would have allowed 
him to secure the costs  from his ex-wife (but the charges  were  raised  with him too 
late for him to be able to pursue her for them);
I can understand the frustration that Mr B feels about his liability for the charges for 
the damage that was caused  by his ex-wife  but I consider  that the description of the 
damage and the photos in the inspection report show  that the car was damaged  
Ref: DRN02786742when it was returned, it didnt comply with the vehicle return  conditions  and the 
damage was more than would  reasonably be considered  to be fair wear and tear;
Hitachi Capital has provided an account statement which shows  that Mr B paid it 
£250 in November 2016 and that the outstanding amount  on the account when it was 
transferred to a debt collection  agent in January 2018 was £1,192.27;
I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Hitachi  Capital to 
charge Mr B for the damage, for the rental  arrears and the tyre repair  less the £250 
that hes already  paid to it;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that Hitachi  Capital has 
acted incorrectly to any significant  extent in its dealings with Mr B about  the 
modifying agreement,  the damage  charges  or the outstanding balance of his 
account; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Hitachi Capital to waive  
(or reduce) the outstanding balance  of Mr Bs account or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 June 2020.
