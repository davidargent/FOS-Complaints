The complaint
F complains about a declined buyer dispute through PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal).
What happened
F bought several wigs through a third party using its PayPal account. F says the goods 
arrived not as described, so it sent them back and asked for a refund. The seller originally 
said they would repair the wigs, then give a refund and eventually did neither. 
F contacted PayPal and raised a buyer dispute, but it was declined. PayPal said it didnt 
offer buyer protection when the goods were purchased to be resold. It said this was 
mentioned in its user agreement that F agreed to when it opened its account. PayPal went 
on to limit and close Fs account due to the number of buyer disputes raised. PayPal said in 
raising the number of disputes that it had, F was in breach of its user agreement. PayPal 
said it was within its terms that it could end the relationship. 
As F remained unhappy, it brought its complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator agreed that in line with the user agreement F signed up to, PayPal didnt offer 
buyer protection for goods due to be resold. Our investigator also found that had a claim 
been accepted, it still wouldve failed as F sent the goods back to an address not registered 
against the sellers account it had with PayPal. 
F didnt agree with the investigators view. 
F said the address was given to it by the seller. F went on to tell our investigator that the 
term in the user agreement that prevented claims for resale items being considered came in 
after it had purchased the wigs. 
Our investigator wasnt persuaded to change his view, so the complaints been passed to me 
for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why.
Firstly, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on F. I recognise F paid a large 
amount of money for goods it says it no longer has. So, I can appreciate the frustration and 
upset this wouldve caused the business. My finding also doesnt consider if the seller has 
done anything wrong or if F has been the victim of fraud  it only considers PayPals 
involvement and actions in the dispute. 
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts user agreement and Buyer Protection Programme (BPP) 
when assessing the claim. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, that it was unfair for it 
to decline the claim in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I dont think 
thats the case.
Although the investigator has largely based their investigation around the fact the user 
agreement doesnt provide cover for buyer disputes when the goods purchased were for 
resale, I think the more important point to focus on here is the fact the Fs account was 
limited and then closed. In these circumstances, PayPal wont progress the dispute, as F 
was no longer a customer. I can see from the information provided to me that the claims 
were declined after the account was limited. 
PayPal, like most account providers has a broad discretion to decide who they want as a 
customer. I wouldnt generally interfere with their decision to close an account unless their 
reasons were unlawful. But I have looked into PayPals reasons, which it has made F aware 
of, and I understand why it closed this account. I find PayPal closed this account in line with 
the terms F agreed to when applying for the account.
The reason PayPal have given for closing the account was due to the amount of buyer 
disputes logged over two different periods of time. PayPal have provided evidence of these 
disputes and Im satisfied that they can limit an account for the reasons its given. I can also 
see that in August 2020 PayPal sent F a notification warning the business that its claim rate 
was higher than average and what would happen if this continued. 
Its also common industry practice for businesses like PayPal to monitor accounts for activity 
which may fall outside their risk appetite, and accounts will often be restricted to prevent 
potential losses after carrying out a review. This is what PayPal have done in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
I have gone on to consider the fact PayPal also declined the disputes on the basis that the 
goods were being used for resale purposes. Having seen the user agreement in place at the 
point F raised a claim, I can see that resale goods were not covered under the buyer dispute 
agreement. Although F has raised an argument that an old user agreement was in place at 
the point the purchase was made and this wouldve provided cover, Im satisfied that user 
agreement relative to the claim would be the one in place at the point the claim was made.  
Im also satisfied the wigs were intended for resale, as Ive seen the comments F made to 
PayPal when it raised the dispute. F mentioned customers that had been waiting for their 
purchases from F for some months. 
Having listened to the call between F and our investigator, its also clear the goods were sent 
back to an address different to the one held by PayPal. PayPal would need to provide the 
address of where the goods should be sent once it agrees to a claim. Although I havent 
investigated or made a finding on this point, it couldve been another reason PayPal chose to 
decline the claim had the account not been closed. I say this as Im aware PayPals user 
agreement also states that the goods should be sent back when PayPal notify the buyer and 
to the address PayPal advises. This is often the one PayPal holds for the seller on their 
account. 
In summary, PayPal have provided a list of the claims made by F. PayPal consider the 
number of claims to be excessive. And having reviewed the list of claims, I find PayPals 
position on this matter to be understandable. All of which means that Im satisfied that 
PayPal havent acted unreasonably by deciding to permanently limited and close Fs account 
or in declining the buyer dispute claim. It follows therefore that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any 
action at this time. I realise this wont be the outcome that F was hoping for, but I trust that it 
will understand, given all that Ive explained and how I arrived at my decision
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask F to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 July 2022.
