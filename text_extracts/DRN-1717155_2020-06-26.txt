What happened
This complaint is about 28 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr T between October 2016 
and May 2019. All the loans were repayable by six monthly repayments and have all been

In its final response letter, Sunny didnt uphold any of the loans. 
Our adjudicator recommended that Mr Ts complaint should be upheld in part. He said that 
by Loan 5 proportionate checks would most likely have shown that Mr T was having 
problems managing his money. Sunny would have become aware that he was using another 
short term lender and had one short term loan outstanding with that lender as well as two 
loans outstanding with Sunny. And he said that by Loan 6, Mr Ts overall pattern of 
borrowing suggested that he had become persistently reliant on short term loans. So he 
recommended that Loans 5 to 28 be upheld.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators recommendations. It said that it enquired about a 
consumers short term loans as well as his income and expenses. It also allowed its 
borrowers to take out up to four loans with it at any one time. At the time of Loan 5, Mr T 
would have had a disposable income of £734.80 after taking into account the contractual 
repayments on Loan 5. It said that this was a reasonable amount of disposable income and 
indicative of the affordability of the loans. 
Sunny also said that Loan 6 was too early for Mr T to be considered to be dependent on its 
loans. It said that Mr T was required to use no more than 14.95% of his monthly income to 
make a contractual repayment on any Sunny loan. It said that this was a reasonable 
proportion of his income and indicative of the affordability of the loans. But it recognised that 
it could have asked Mr T further questions about the manner in which he used its product. At 
the point after which Loan 10 was granted, Sunny said that it may have been prudent for it to 
have discussed Mr Ts financial circumstances with him and how he was using the product. So it offered to partially uphold Mr Ts complaint about Loans 11 onwards and refund the 
interest paid on these loans, pay 8% interest on the refunds and remove the loans from Mr 
Ts credit file.
Mr T rejected Sunnys offer. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
To start with, it seems that Mr T has accepted our adjudicators findings about Loans 1 to 4. 
So I think this means I no longer need to make a decision about these loans. But I have kept 
these loans in mind when considering Loans 5 to 10.
As Sunny has offered to settle Loans 11 onwards, I havent investigated these loans below. 
But I have included the redress for them in my compensation award.
When Sunny lent to Mr T the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant 
regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The CONC 
contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the CONC defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the consumer should be able to make repayments, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Sunny did a number of checks before it lent to Mr T. It asked him for details of his monthly 
income and expenditure. Mr Ts declared income for all the loans was £1,354.17. Mr Ts total 
expenditure for Loans 5 to 10 ranged from £458 to £792. 
Sunny also checked Mr Ts credit file before agreeing to the loans. It has provided us with a 
brief summary of the results of its credit checks. It appears from the summaries Ive seen 
that there wasnt any adverse information such as bankruptcy, IVAs or debt management 
plans that I think should have caused additional concerns to Sunny. 
Weve received a credit report from Mr T and I can see that there were other short term 
loans on that report which Ive referred to below. 
As I mentioned above each of Mr Ts loans was repayable by six monthly instalments. So 
the amounts that Mr T needed to repay each time were smaller than if hed taken a normal 
payday loan. But he was also committing to making those repayments over a far longer 
period. In addition Mr T sometimes had a number of loans outstanding at the same time. So 
Ive needed to consider the total amount that Mr T needed to repay to Sunny each month. 
By the time Mr T applied for Loan 5, I think that Sunny should have realised that it couldnt 
safely rely on the information hed provided about his financial situation. Loan 5 was Mr Ts 
third loan in four days. Loans 3 and 4 were still outstanding and the total amount outstanding 
totalled £600 which was the highest amount Mr T had borrowed from Sunny to date. His total 
repayments for the three loans were also significantly higher than his previous total 
repayments. I think Sunny should have asked him some very specific questions about any 
other short term loans that he was already committed to repaying. 
Ive looked carefully at the information Mr T has provided us with to see what better checks 
would have shown Sunny at that time. Although weve not received Mr Ts bank statements, 
we have received his credit report. I can see on that report that Mr T had borrowed a loan of 
£420 from another lender in the same month that Loans 3 to 5 were borrowed.  This loan 
would have required repayment at the same time as Loans 3 to 5.  On balance, I think      Mr 
Ts borrowing suggests that he was having problems managing his money and in these 
circumstances I think there was a significant risk that Mr T wouldnt have been able to repay 
Loan 5 sustainably. So I dont think Loan 5 should have been provided to Mr T. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 6. I say this because:
By Loan 6, Mr T had been borrowing from Sunny for almost a year.
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amounts he owed Sunny. His total debt to 
Sunny was increasing in an unsustainable manner. Loans 3, 4 and 5 were outstanding when Mr T took out Loan 6 and the total amount of these four loans of 
£750 was the highest in his borrowing history with Sunny.
Mr Ts total monthly repayments had increased to around £248 which was his highest 
total monthly amount yet.
Mr T had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
 
I can see that as Sunny didnt stop lending at this point, Mr T went on to take out a further 22 
high cost loans for around another 19 months. 
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from Loan 6 
onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing 
him to continue to have expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended 
period of time. The number of loans, and length of time he'd been borrowing, was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him 
in the market for these high cost loans. And the fact that all the loans were repaid doesnt 
mean that they were repaid sustainably, or without causing Mr T undue difficulty. 
I note that Sunny said that Mr T was required to use no more than 14.95% of his monthly 
income to make a contractual repayment on any Sunny loan. It also said that this was a 
reasonable proportion of his income and indicative of the affordability of the loans. I think the 
percentage of Mr Ts monthly income used to repay the loans was far higher than 14.95% as 
Mr T often had two to four loan repayments to make to Sunny each month. And the fact that 
Mr T appeared to use a small percentage of his monthly income to make the repayments 
and appeared to have sufficient disposable income, doesnt show that the repayments were 
sustainable.
I note that Sunny said it had used Mr Ts declared income and expenditure and the credit 
commitments shown at the CRAs to ensure that the loans could be repaid without undue 
difficulty. But I think Sunny will (or ought to) know from previous decisions that this service 
considers there will be times when the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate that a 
consumer is likely to be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should 
relending continue. So it follows that successful repayment of a loan doesnt automatically 
mean it was repaid sustainably.
I also think that when a consumer borrows numerous loans over a long period of time, its 
most likely that the loans arent being used for their intended purpose of temporary cash flow 
problems. As Sunny will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter to CEOs of high cost 
lending firms that a high volume of relending..may be symptomatic of unsustainable 
lending patterns. And I think that is the case here.
So, I think that Sunny needs to pay Mr T some compensation relating to Loans 5 to 28. Ive 
included Sunnys offer in respect of Loans 11 onwards in my award. So Sunny should put 
things right as shown below.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this complaint 
I order Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, to:
1. Refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on Loans 5 to 28;
2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on such refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*;
3. Remove all adverse entries about Loan 5 from Mr Ts credit file; and4. Remove all entries about Loans 6 to 28 from Mr Ts credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
