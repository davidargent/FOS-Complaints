The complaint
Mr O is unhappy that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter has made a CIFAS 
loading against him for evasion of payment on a loan.
What happened
Mr O took out a loan with RateSetter in July 2019 for Â£14,000. Mr O has told us he took the 
loan to help him start buying and selling cars. He made his first repayment in August 2019.
Mr O didnt make a repayment in September 2019 and made no contact with the lender. And 
so RateSetter phoned Mr O to discuss the missing payment. Mr O asked for a callback that 
evening. But when RateSetter called back Mr O didnt answer.
RateSetter then repeatedly tried to contact Mr O, almost daily, over the following three 
months. Letters, emails, and text messages were sent, and voicemails were left. But 
RateSetter never heard from Mr O and he didnt get back to the business. No further 
payments were made.
RateSetter notified Mr O of an intention to visit him to discuss the loan. It followed through 
with that visit and was informed that Mr O no longer resided at the address.
RateSetter defaulted the account and passed the debt to a collection agency in 
December 2019. In January 2020 it loaded a CIFAS marker against Mr O under the category 
of evasion of payment.
Mr O contacted RateSetter for the first time in June 2020. He asked about setting up a 
payment plan and RateSetter said hed have to discuss with the debt collection agency. It 
discussed the address issue with Mr O, and he said he did still live at the same address. 
Mr O asked for the CIFAS loading to be removed as it was having a significant impact on 
him. But RateSetter refused to do so.
Mr O made a complaint about what had happened, including the loading of the CIFAS 
marker. RateSetter said it wouldnt remove the CIFAS loading and maintained its position 
regarding the debt collection agency. And so Mr O brought his complaint to this service.
Mr O told us that he believes the CIFAS loading is unfair. He says he fell into financial 
difficulties after obtaining the loan and so was unable to repay it.  He said he was suffering a 
great deal of stress at the time, and couldnt face such matters, which is why he didnt 
discuss repayment or the arrears with RateSetter.
Mr O told us that RateSetters actions had led to his business account with a high-street 
bank being closed. 
One of our investigators considered Mr Os complaint but found that RateSetter had acted 
fairly and reasonably in the circumstances. He could see that RateSetter had made in 
excess of 50 attempts to contact Mr O about the arrears and had received no response from 
him. He noted that, on the occasions RateSetter had spoken to Mr O, he had said he was 
too busy to discuss the situation and that hed never informed it of his financial difficulties.
Mr O didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding it. Ill explain why.
The question I have to answer here is whether RateSetter has fairly applied the CIFAS 
loading against Mr O. And so I must consider whether theres sufficient evidence to support 
that Mr O was evading payment, given thats what the loading was for. Having considered all 
of the evidence and information available, I believe RateSetter has acted fairly and 
reasonably in the circumstances.
The evidence clearly shows a great many attempts by RateSetter to contact Mr O, and by 
various means. Theres no real dispute about just how frequently RateSetter was trying to 
get in touch with Mr O. 
Whats also clear is that Mr O made no attempts to speak with RateSetter. He was given 
numerous channels to do so, including speaking on the phone, writing a letter, or sending an 
email. But none of these opportunities were taken, for many months. Instead, Mr O actively 
avoided contact on at least two occasions when he declined to speak with RateSetter on the 
phone. And that was despite, at least in the second call, the seriousness of the status of the 
account being highlighted to him. 
I appreciate Mr O has said he was having a difficult time when all of this was happening and 
that he struggled to discuss his finances. But I dont find it was fair and reasonable for him to 
have given no indication of what his situation was and to ignore all contact from RateSetter.
Mr O has told us about a limited company for which he is a director. Hes told us about this 
to help show that he was in a difficult financial position, given that hed fallen into arrears on 
a mortgage. Whilst I can see that this might help demonstrate he was in financial difficulty I 
dont believe it means that his lack of contact with RateSetter can then be reasonably 
explained to the extent that it was unfair of it to make the CIFAS loading.
Ive also noted that the company Mr O is the director of had pending action for compulsory 
strike-off at the time RateSetter was trying to discuss the loan with him. That was in fact true 
of two companies of which Mr O was the sole director. Those records are freely available on 
Companies House.
But what those records also show is that Mr O was able to provide suitable explanation and 
evidence to avoid strike-off action for both companies. To me, this demonstrates a 
willingness and ability to engage in important matters involving finances. And it follows that it 
wouldnt be unfair to say that Mr O ought to have similarly engaged with RateSetter.
In addition to these points I am somewhat concerned at the fact that payments are missed 
so soon after a large sum of money is borrowed. Mr O said he was borrowing the money to 
help him start buying and selling cars to make an income. But that doesnt seem to have led 
to him being in a position to maintain repayments at all. If Mr O was already in financial 
difficulty at the point he took the loan that it would seem fair and reasonable to say that he 
was already aware that he wouldnt be able to make repayments. Which would further 
support the action taken by RateSetter.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2021.
