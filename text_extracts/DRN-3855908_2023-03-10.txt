The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) allowed him to use his 
funds for gambling. 
What happened
Mr M contacted NatWest in 2016 and asked them to place a gambling block on his debit 
card. Despite this, he was able to make payments to a betting company  who Ill refer to as 
company G. So, Mr M complained. NatWest responded and explained, due to the time 
lapsed, as well as Mr Ms recent account closure, they were unable to confirm whether the 
block was applied in 2016. They explained theyd also been unable to locate any information 
to determine how and why Mr M was able to make further payments to company G. NatWest 
said the gambling block doesnt 100% stop all gambling payments and if any are made then 
NatWest arent liable to refund the payments. NatWest said this should be explained to all 
customers prior to the block being applied but, because of the time lapsed, theyd been 
unable to locate the call where the block was requested so they cant confirm this 
explanation was given to Mr M. 
NatWest explained theyd checked their records and located payments to company G 
between November 2018 to September 2019 totalling £18,564. They then identified a total of 
£13,469.39 paid into Mr Ms account so they agreed to refund Mr M the difference of 
£5,094.61. NatWest also explained they understand Mr M is unhappy he has been able to 
make payments to another gambling company  who Ill refer to as company K. NatWest 
explained the gambling block was in place on Mr Ms debit card, but these payments were 
made using online banking and sent via Faster Payment. NatWest explained, when they 
apply a gambling block to a debit card, it is only debit card transactions which are prevented 
from making payments to gambling companies. NatWest said they have no control over 
payments which are made through online banking.  
Our investigator looked into things for Mr M. He thought NatWest didnt need to refund Mr M 
any of the gambling transactions made to company K but felt they shouldve offered Mr M 
more support for his gambling addiction. So, he recommended they pay Mr M £300 
compensation. NatWest agreed but Mr M disagreed so the matter has come to me for a 
decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. And, I think the investigators 
recommendation here is a fair way to resolve matters. I should also clarify, my decision has 
only focused on the complaint which has been addressed by NatWest in their complaint 
response in October 2021. NatWest have confirmed, if Mr M wishes to complain about other 
gambling transactions, he will need to raise these so they can investigate them first. 
My role requires me to say how a complaint should be settled quickly and with minimal 
formality and so Ill focus on what I consider to be the crux of the complaint and the main 
areas of dispute. The key facts about the part of the complaint relating to company G arent 
in dispute. NatWest have admitted they got things wrong and have agreed to refund Mr M 
the difference between what he spent and what he received from the gambling transactions. 
Theres no dispute from Mr M to this offer so Ive looked at the remaining parts of Mr Ms 
complaint. 
Ill start off by saying, I can see Mr M has previously raised a separate complaint about 
gambling transactions carried out through his NatWest account. These transactions were to 
company R and NatWest accepted theyd made an error and agreed to refund the balance 
between what Mr M spent and what he received. Although Ive considered this complaint on 
its own facts, I have reviewed the information from the complaint involving company R as 
NatWests position on gambling blocks and the timelines also apply here.  
In the complaint involving company R, NatWest provided evidence which shows they placed 
a block on Mr Ms debit card on 21 May 2020 and it was set to expire on 21 June 2021. 
During this time, and between July 2020 to October 2020, Mr M was able to carry out 
gambling transactions with company R. NatWest accepted the block shouldve prevented  
Mr M from carrying out these transactions, so they were unsure how these went through. So, 
NatWest refunded the balance between what Mr M spent and what he received. 
I can see the gambling transactions with company K were made between January 2021 to 
March 2021. Similar to the transactions with company R, these transactions were also 
carried out while the block was still in place. So, I understand why Mr M believes these 
should also be refunded. NatWest say the payments to company K were made by Mr M 
using his online banking and sent via Faster Payment. They say, when they apply a 
gambling block to a debit card, it is only debit card transactions which are prevented from 
making payments to gambling companies. NatWest say they have no control over payments 
which are made via online banking. 
Ive looked at Mr Ms account statement and this shows all payments to company R were 
Point of Sale transactions  meaning Mr M used his debit card and wouldve been required 
to enter his PIN. However, in the case of company K, the statement shows all transactions 
were made through online banking. So, I dont think the circumstances involving company R 
and company K are similar here  and I dont think its unreasonable for NatWest to decline 
to refund transactions made to company K based on the gambling block that was in place at 
the time. That said, Ive gone further to consider what other steps NatWest couldve taken. 
NatWest have explained that, between 2016 to October 2020, the process to apply a 
gambling block was different. They say Mr M wouldve needed to call them to apply a block. 
They say they cant now see whether this was the case due to the passage of time, but Ive 
already explained the evidence Ive seen which shows a block was in place from May 2020. 
NatWest say the process to apply a block then changed in October 2020 and Mr M wouldve 
needed to do this himself on his mobile app. NatWest say Mr M was thereafter in control of 
adding and removing the block himself. 
I can see NatWest did explain to Mr M in November 2020 that this upgrade to their mobile 
app is an enhancement to what they already do. They said, to ensure they continue to block 
spending on Mr Ms debit card for gambling, he should tick the relevant block box in the 
mobile app. NatWest say this block has the feature of a 48-hour cool off once turned on, so 
this allows Mr M time to really consider if he wants to turn the block back off again. Offering support mechanisms like gambling blocks can be incredibly useful for people. But 
only if they are designed in a mindful and considered way. And while I appreciate that not 
everyone who chooses to apply a gambling block to their account will have a compulsive 
spending addiction, a number of them will. And so, the tool should be designed with this in 
mind. I think its fair to say gambling blocks, like the one NatWest have in place, should be 
quick and easy to apply, but some friction and time delays should be in place in order to 
have them removed. Recovering gambling addicts have repeatedly explained that the desire 
to place a bet will dissipate over time. If they can be prevented in the moment from acting on 
their impulse, it can make a fundamental difference. And I think NatWests feature of the 48-
hour cool off period provides such friction and time delay to help prevent Mr M from acting 
on impulse.  
Its important to recognise the type of gambling block provided by NatWest, and other 
financial institutions, are voluntary in nature, meaning that its up to the account holder to 
implement the gambling block, and also that the account holder retains the option to remove 
the gambling block should they want to do so. While these voluntary gambling blocks do 
provide a degree of support for account holders who have a gambling addiction, they dont 
provide any guarantee that the account holder wont disable the block in order to continue 
making transfers to gambling companies. NatWest have provided evidence of Mr Ms actions 
on his debit card and account, and this doesnt show Mr M placed a block using his app. 
I do empathise with Mr M and I hope he is doing better now. I appreciate Mr M will be 
disappointed with the outcome Ive reached. But based on everything Ive seen I cant say 
Mr Ms spending on gambling with company K is down to an error by NatWest. NatWest did 
have a block in place and, while this didnt appear to have worked as it shouldve, the way in 
which Mr M carried out his transactions with company K, means the block wouldnt have 
prevented these in any event. They also then introduced a further layer of protection in the 
form of an upgrade to their mobile app, but NatWest explain this doesnt completely stop all 
gambling payments and was reliant on Mr M downloading the app and checking the box. I 
think its fair to say NatWest took reasonable steps to assist Mr M in accordance with their 
policies. So I cant fairly instruct NatWest to refund the payments Mr M made to company K. 
NatWest accept their support couldve been better at a time when Mr M was gambling 
frequently. They also agree with Mr Ms complaint about being able to carry out transactions 
to company G despite the block being in place. NatWest have agreed to pay Mr M the £300 
compensation recommended by our investigator. And I think this is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.    
Putting things right
Ive taken the view that NatWest didnt provide Mr M with the support he required at a time 
when he was gambling frequently. So, NatWest should pay Mr M £300 compensation for the 
upset and frustration caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc must pay    
Mr M £300 compensation.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2023.
