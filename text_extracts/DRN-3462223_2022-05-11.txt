The complaint
Mr B complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) for issues he experienced 
in updating his address through its platform. He wants PayPal to make changes to its system 
and information, and to apologise to him. 
What happened
Mr B had a PayPal account. 
He opened a PayPal Credit account, which he accessed through his main PayPal account. It 
appeared to him to be a subsidiary service. 
In late 2020, Mr B moved home. In November 2020 he updated his home address on the 
main PayPal account. He says that he searched for how to update his address, and used the 
option which was shown. 
This updated Mr Bs main PayPal address, but did not update his PayPal Credit address. 
PayPal Credit then sent a paper statement out to Mr B and this was received by the new 
occupiers of Mr Bs former address. 
Mr B learned that his statement had been sent out and he was embarrassed. 
He contacted PayPal, and PayPal was able to update Mr Bs PayPal Credit address 
immediately. 
Mr B complained to PayPal. He felt that the platform had been unclear and that this had led 
to a breach of his data. He fears that his data could be misused. 
PayPal responded to the complaint in June 2021. It said that PayPal and PayPal Credit are 
separate entities and consumers need to update their addresses in both accounts. 
Mr B was not happy with this and contacted us. 
PayPal has subsequently offered Mr B £100 compensation for his distress and 
inconvenience. 
One of our investigators has looked into this matter and set out their view to the parties. This 
was that PayPal Credit had acted in line with its terms in sending the statement to the 
address registered with PayPal Credit and that PayPal acted reasonably in updating Mr Bs 
address when he contacted PayPal in November 2020. He therefore thought that PayPal did 
not need to do anything further. 
Mr B did not accept that view and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
I have set out a preliminary view to both parties by email. In that view I explained that I 
consider that the complaint ought to be upheld, but that I thought that PayPals offer of 
compensation was appropriate to the distress and inconvenience suffered by Mr B. I asked 
both parties for their comments before I reached a final decision. 
Neither party has responded to my preliminary view or provided any other information. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Based on what I have seen, I think that PayPal has made mistakes in this case. This is 
because it appears that there is one login for PayPal and PayPal Credit can then be 
accessed openly from within PayPal. 
Mr B has explained that there is a search function within PayPal and when he searched to 
update address details the platform returned only one option. 
Mr B used this, and assumed that this would update his details across all accounts through 
that platform. He says that it was not made clear to him that he needed to separately update 
his address in PayPal Credit, which appeared to be a subsidiary account. 
PayPal has not disputed this, nor provided any evidence to contradict Mr Bs explanation. 
I therefore accept Mr Bs explanation and think it was reasonable for him to assume that 
updating his address in the main account would update all linked accounts. 
This is further supported by the fact that PayPal was able to update Mr Bs details in PayPal 
Credit when he contacted them after the statement had been sent, without Mr B having to 
contact another business. 
Based on this, I uphold Mr Bs complaint. 
Putting things right
Looking then to putting things right, I have asked Mr B to provide details of the distress and 
inconvenience he suffered. I explained that if the statement was an ordinary statement, 
showing some debt and some personal information, but not showing anything out of the 
ordinary, then I thought that the £100 compensation offered by PayPal was likely 
appropriate. 
As Mr B has not provided any further information or argument, I remain of that view and think 
that £100 is appropriate, and in line with other awards we would make in similar 
circumstances. I therefore think that PayPal has made an appropriate offer of resolution. 
Mr B has indicated that he wants PayPal to make its website clearer, but as my colleague 
advised, we are not able to tell businesses how they should display information or operate 
their systems.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint, but think that PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA has made a reasonable offer of resolution. I do not ask PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA to do anything further. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
