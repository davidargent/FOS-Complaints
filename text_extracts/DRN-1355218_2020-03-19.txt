The complaint
Mr E says Bank of Scotland plc mis-sold him a mortgage payment protection insurance 
(MPPI) policy.
What happened
Mr E took out an MPPI policy with a mortgage in 2006. He paid a monthly amount for the 
policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr E disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Es case. 
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Es complaint for the following reasons.
Mr E answered questions to confirm his eligibility for the policy. The mortgage offer 
documents described it as optional. So, I think Bank of Scotland made Mr E aware that he 
had a choice about buying the MPPI, and that he chose to take it. 
Bank of Scotland recommended the MPPI to Mr E, and it seems to have been right for him 
based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time. 
The cost of the policy was shown. So I think Mr E wouldve understood how much he would 
need to pay for it. 
Its possible that Bank of Scotland didnt point out the main things the policy didnt cover. But 
Mr E doesnt appear to have been affected by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Mr Es comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
 
 
 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 April 2020.Phillip Lai-Fang
