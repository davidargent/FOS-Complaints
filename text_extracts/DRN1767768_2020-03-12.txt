K821x#15complaint
Mr J says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one flex credit  account  (loan 1) and 20 instalment loans (loans  2 to 21) 
Sunny provided  to Mr J between October  2014  and April 2017. Mr Js borrowing history is 
summarised at the end of this decision.
Before we issued  our opinion on the complaint, Sunny offered to uphold Mr Js complaint 
from loan 9 onwards.  Our adjudicator reviewed the case and thought Sunnys offer didnt go 
far enough. They thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards shouldnt  have  been  given because 
the pattern  of the borrowing suggested  Mr J had become reliant on short-term loans. 
Sunny disagreed and said it had done robust  checks on Mr Js creditworthiness  and 
affordability checks. These checks indicated that Mr Js disposable income  was sufficient to 
meet the repayments for the loans. It also said that Mr J had repaid all of his loans  early,  
meaning he was paying  less interest.  And Sunny was of the opinion that Mr J was borrowing 
what he needed and was able to repay the loans  without  difficulty.  
As an informal resolution couldnt  be reached, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN17677682I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend upholding  Mr Js complaint  about  loans 1 to 4. Mr J didnt 
respond to the adjudicators opinion. As these loans appear to no longer be in dispute,  I 
wont make  any further findings  on them. So, Ive focused my decision on loans 5 to 22 and 
having done so Im partially upholding Mr Js complaint. Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by   
loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr J was not managing his finances. I dont 
necessarily agree  with Sunnys conclusion that by repaying a loan early  this means Mr J 
was managing his money. Its equally possible that Mr J was juggling  his finances by 
borrowing to pay off his short-term loans with Sunny or other  short-term  loan providers.   
Mr J had taken  out 5 loans within 10 months.  So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr J was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably. 
Mr Js first instalment loan was for £50 and loan 5 was for £150. At this point Sunny 
should have known that it was unlikely Mr J was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but more to meet an ongoing  need.  
From loan 5 onwards Mr J was provided with a new loan within  weeks of taking out the 
previous one. 
Mr J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Sunny. Loan 21 was taken 
out two and a half years after Mr Js first. Mr J had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ref: DRN17677683I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards 
because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Js indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to have 
had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr J paid on loans  5 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries  about loans  6 to 21 should be removed from  Mr Js 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr J a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2020.
