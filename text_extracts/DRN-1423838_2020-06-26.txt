Complaint
Miss M complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called Gain 
Credit LLC, trading at the time as Lending Stream. Miss M says she was lent to irresponsibly 
and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to LS throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Miss M took out some 12 instalment loans from LS between April 2013 
and February 2019. Ive enclosed a summary of Miss Ms borrowing with LS, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan number 10 onwards. LS doesnt agree with this so it therefore asked 
that the complaint be sent for an ombudsmans final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Miss Ms 
complaint.
LS needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss M could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks 
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being 
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
LS should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, LS was required to establish whether Miss M could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss M could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
LS told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to Miss 
M. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which LS should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some point, LS 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
I think the checks which LS most likely carried out at the beginning would have been quite 
basic ones. But bearing in mind what Ive said above, about the length of the lending 
relationship, I also think these would have probably been proportionate for loans 1 and 2. I 
think these levels of checks, together with the income and expenditure details provided by 
Miss M, would have made those particular early loans appear affordable.
By the time loans 3, 4 and 5 were applied for I note there were a number of gaps in the 
lending. In short, the lending slowed down; with loans 3  5 only being applied for somewhat 
intermittently and with what Id call significant gaps in between them (November 2014, May 
2016 and October 2017). I therefore apply the same process again about financial checks at 
the more basic level probably being acceptable because the loans were each new ones 
due to the long gaps in lending.
However, after this point, I can see the lending started to accelerate again and become 
much more frequent. And I think that by loan number 10, there was an emerging pattern of 
repeated lending evident in this case. The overall pattern of LSs lending to Miss M at the 
point of loan 10 should have caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any 
further loans. 
LS has made some reasonable points about the financial checks it carried out for some of 
these loans, many of which were more enhanced or searching checks than before. On this 
basis it says Miss M could afford them. However, whilst this can be broadly welcomed in the 
context of what I refer to above  the loans affordable on a pounds and pence calculation - 
it nevertheless misses the point about the repeated nature of the lending at the point of loan 
10. 
These were expensive loans ill-suited to the long term. And LS ought to have realised that 
Miss M wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; she was 
borrowing regularly, to address shortfalls in her income and to meet an ongoing need. She 
was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term lending over a sustained period 
and the indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. LS should 
have realised Miss M was at risk of not managing to repay the loans sustainably or getting 
into financial difficulties. 
By Loan number 10, this was Miss Ms sixth consecutive short-term loan application with LS 
in just 10 months or so (taking account of the gaps in the earlier Ive factored in), without any 
real break. Much of the lending also involved Miss M being advanced money whilst previous loans were still outstanding which obviously meant her overall monthly payments were 
increasing. So Im upholding this complaint in respect of loans 10 - 12. LS repeatedly lent to 
Miss M in an unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans
 
Putting things right  what LS needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 10 - 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 -12 should be completely 
removed from Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires LS to take off tax from this interest. LS must give Miss M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Miss Ms complaint. Gain Credit LLC should put things 
right for Miss M as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
