K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender)  did not carry out 
reasonable checks before lending to him.
background
Mr B had four loans  from Mr Lender between January  2016  and February  2017  as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment* Due Repaid
1 7 Jan 2016 £200 6m £70.66 10 Jun 2016 15 Apr 2016
2 17 Apr 2016 £400 6m £149.86 30 Sep 2016 12 Sep 2016
3 12 Sep 2016 £450 6m £156.90 17 Feb 2017 On time
4 17 Feb 2017 £900 6m £351.60 3 Aug 2017 Outstanding
* Maximum  scheduled monthly  repayment over the term of the loan
Mr B says that if Mr Lender  had carried out better checks it would have realised he was 
reliant on short-term loans and could not afford the repayments. He says he suffered a 
significant deterioration in his financial situation as a result of the irresponsible  lending.
Mr Lender says it asked Mr B about his income and expenditure as well as checking his 
credit file. It says the repayments were a small proportion of Mr Bs income and there were 
no indications that he was struggling financially. It adds that, when Mr B told it he was having 
difficulty making the payments, it agreed a repayment plan with him.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. He said that by loan 
4, Mr Bs pattern of borrowing indicated that there was a risk he wouldnt be able to 
sustainably make the repayments.  He recommended that interest and charges on loan 4 
(plus 8% statutory interest) should  be refunded to Mr B and that any associated adverse 
information should be removed from his credit  file.
Mr Lender responded  to say, in summary, that there was too little detail in the assessment.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr B and to Mr Lender on 2 December 2019. I summarise 
my findings  here:
I found that the maximum  scheduled  repayments  were a small proportion  of Mr Bs 
income for loans  1 and 2 and that there was nothing in the credit check that indicated  
Mr Lender was wrong to approve  them;
Mr Lender  asked  Mr B about his regular expenditure before approving loan 3. His 
declared disposable income was just under £700 so I was satisfied  Mr Lender would 
have found the repayments to be affordable. Mr B had a good repayment record and 
I considered it was reasonable for Mr Lender to have approved this loan;
Mr B repaid loan 3 on time, but applied for loan 4 the same  day. As the application 
was for twice the amount of the previous loan, and Mr B had been  borrowing from 
Mr Lender for over a year,  Id have expected a proportionate check to include asking 
Mr B whether he had any other outstanding short-term loans. I couldnt see it did that, 
so I had a look at what such a check was likely to have shown;
Ref: DRN36506662I could see Mr B had one other short-term loan outstanding at the time, but it seemed 
Mr B had included that repayment (along with another longer term loan repayment) in 
the expenditure figures hed declared  to Mr Lender. As Mr Bs declared disposable 
income was now just over £600,  I didnt think better checks would have shown loan 4 
to be unaffordable.  So I couldnt see Mr Lender  did anything wrong by approving 
Mr Bs fourth loan;
I also considered it acted positively and sympathetically by setting up a repayment 
plan for Mr B when  he said he was in financial difficulties.
So my provisional decision was that I did not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr Lender responded  to say, in summary, that it had nothing further to add.
Mr B did not respond to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr B didnt respond, and Mr Lender had no further information to add, I see no reason to 
depart from my provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2020.
