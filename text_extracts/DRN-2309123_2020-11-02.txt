The complaint
Mrs E complains that NewDay Ltd (trading as Marbles) raised her credit limit repeatedly
when she held a credit card with it. She said this was irresponsible lending.
What happened
Mrs E said her credit limit had been increased irresponsibly on a card she held with
NewDay. She said the increases sometimes happened after a late payment. And she said
that she had another card with NewDay, so she thought it knew about her spending. Mrs E
said the increased credit limit had contributed to her financial difficulties. And she had raised
this with NewDay quite some time ago, but it hadnt responded to her concerns.
NewDay said Mrs E took this card out on 19 April 2017. She passed its credit checks then.
She was then given credit limit increases as followed 
offer dated 25 September 2017, of increase from £450.00 to £1,350.00. This took effect 
on 30 October 2017.
offer dated 26 January 2018, of increase from £1,350.00 to £2,100.00. This took effect 
on the 6 February 2018.
offer dated 22 June 2018, offering increase from £2,100.00 to £3,300.00. This took effect 
on 6 July 2018.
Because all of these increases took effect less than 40 days from being offered, NewDay
thought it was likely Mrs E called NewDay to ask for the increase to be implemented, rather
than waiting for it to go up automatically within 40 days of the date on the offer letter.
NewDay said it knew that Mrs E had charges for a late payment fee in the six months prior to
two of her credit limits being increased. But NewDay said that didnt rule customers out from
an increase, unless they were paying late in each of the three months leading up to the
increase, which wasnt the case for Mrs E.
NewDay said it had looked at this lending again, and it still thought it had lent to Mrs E
responsibly.
NewDay said that a reduced payment arrangement was agreed on 24 January 2019 for
£11.69. In February 2019 Mrs E told NewDay she was in financial hardship, because of a
change in her income.
On 4 March, a debt management charity put forward an offer of £1.00 per month on Mrs Es
behalf. NewDay said it was writing to Mrs E throughout this time. On 18 June NewDay wrote
to her to say it was going to register a default on her credit file. On 31 July 2019, the account
was sold to a third party debt collector, and the default was recorded on Mrs Es credit file.
NewDay said it was sorry that it hadnt replied to Mrs Es complaint sooner. But it didnt think
it had done anything wrong.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said he hadnt looked at Mrs
Es other NewDay account, as that was separate to this complaint. He felt that the initial
credit limit on this card was acceptable, and the first credit limit rise in September 2017 was
also acceptable. The January 2018 offer was also acceptable. But the June 2018 offer came
after a series of late fees. Mrs E had paid late five times in a six month period. So our
investigator didnt think a credit limit increase offer shouldve been made straight after that.
He said that NewDay should refund all interest and charges from July 2018 onwards, and
should amend Mrs Es credit file.
NewDay didnt agree with that. It said that Mrs Es payments were just slightly late. And it
said that she was able to maintain her monthly payments. So it didnt think it had done
anything wrong by making the last offer of a limit increase. It said that it was only because of
unforeseen circumstances, that Mrs Es income then reduced. But our investigator didnt
change his mind. He still thought further checks were warranted before that third limit
increase was offered, given the history of Mrs Es account just before then.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was then passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Ive looked carefully at Mrs Es card, and also at the other card she held with 
NewDay. I think its relevant to consider the conduct of both cards, as thats 
information NewDay had before it decided to lend Mrs E more money.
I agree with our investigator that it wasnt irresponsible for NewDay to offer Mrs E a 
credit card, or to offer her the first two limit increases on that card. I dont think that 
there were signs then that shouldve made NewDay think such lending would be 
irresponsible.
But, like our investigator, I also think that the third increase ought not to have been 
made without further enquiries. I dont agree with NewDay that there is no cause for 
concern if Mrs E makes five of the preceding six monthly payments late, even if those 
payments are larger than the minimum required. I also note that if NewDay had done 
further investigations into Mrs Es credit file at that time, it wouldve found that Mrs E 
had taken a very sizeable loan earlier that year. So it seems less likely that, if 
NewDay had looked closely at Mrs Es financial position, this additional lending would 
still have been made.
However, Im suggesting a different award in this case to our investigator. I think that
NewDay should refund all the charges on this account from 6 July 2018. I also think 
that NewDay should refund all interest on lending above the previous credit limit, of 
£2,100, from 6 July 2018. Thats because I think the previous limit increase was 
reasonable, but the 6 July increase wasnt. This money should be refunded onto Mrs 
Es existing debt. If that debt has been repaid, then this refund should be paid to Mrs 
E, plus 8% simple interest from the date the charges or interest were incurred.
I do think that NewDays third limit increase should not have been made, and it 
meant things were even more difficult for Mrs E, when she later ran into financial 
difficulties. So I think NewDay should pay Mrs E £100 in compensation.
But I dont think that NewDay does have to amend Mrs Es credit file. I understand, 
from Mrs Es other card account, that she was having serious financial difficulties in 
2019. Because of that, I think that this account would still have defaulted, even if the 
third credit limit increase in 2018 hadnt been made.I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mrs E said she had nothing to add. NewDay didnt reply. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.

My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd (trading as Marbles) must do the following -
refund all the charges on this account from 6 July 2018.
refund all interest on lending above the previous credit limit, of £2,100, from 6 July 2018.

This money should be refunded onto Mrs Es existing debt. If that debt has been repaid, then
this refund should be paid to Mrs E, plus 8% simple interest from the date the charges or
interest were incurred.
NewDay Ltd must also pay Mrs E £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2020.
