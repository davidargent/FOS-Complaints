The complaint
T, a company, is unhappy with the service it received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) in relation to a monetary transfer made to a third party.
What happened
T made an online transfer of approximately Â£1,500. Unfortunately, there was an error in the 
intended recipients account details inputted by T which meant that the sent money didnt 
reach the intended recipient. 
T contacted NatWest and advised of its mistake. NatWest contacted the intended recipients 
bank and attempted to locate and recovery the money for T. The sent money was located by 
the recipients bank, but the recipients bank then made the decision to not return the money 
to NatWest but rather to credit the sent money to another account in the intended recipients 
name. T wasnt happy about this, so it raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Ts complaint  which T raised in three separate stages  but it noted that 
the decision made by the recipients bank to not return the sent money was a decision over 
which NatWest itself had no control. So, NatWest didnt uphold that aspect of Ts complaint.
T wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of 
our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that several aspects of Ts complaint 
had been brought by T after the six-month referral rights provided by NatWest on their earlier 
complaint response letters had expired, which meant that these aspects of Ts complaint fell 
outside the remit of what this service can consider.
Our investigator also felt that NatWest had made reasonable efforts to recover the sent 
money in response to Ts request, and that ultimately the reason that the money wasnt 
recovered was because of a decision made by the recipients bank over which NatWest had 
no control. So, they didnt uphold Ts complaint.
T remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been disappointing for T to have learned that the money it 
sent to the incorrect bank details had been recovered but that the recipients bank who had 
located the money had made the decision to not return the sent money, but rather to credit it 
to an alternative account held in the intended recipients name.
T first raised a complaint with NatWest about this issue shortly after the incident occurred in 
early 2019, and then raised a follow up complaint after receiving NatWests initial complaint 
response. T then raised a further follow up complaint in relation to this issue in mid-2020.
This means that T has received three complaint response letters from NatWest  dated 
February 2019, May 2019, and October 2020.
This service doesnt have a free hand to look at every complaint thats referred to us. The 
rules we operate under  known as the Dispute Resolution (DISP) rules in the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook  explain our jurisdiction. 
The relevant section here is DISP 2.8.2 which says that, unless the business being 
complaint about consents, or unless exceptional circumstances apply, we cant consider a 
complaint if its brought to us more than six months after date of the complaint response 
letter issued by the respondent business. 
In this case, the aspects of Ts complaint that were addressed by NatWest in their first two 
complaint responses of February and May 2019 have been brought to us by T more than six 
months after the dates of those complaint responses. 
Furthermore, NatWest hasnt consented to us looking at these aspects of Ts complaint, and 
I cant see that exceptional circumstances apply in this instance. As such, Im satisfied that 
these aspects of Ts complaint  which are concerned primarily with the standard of service 
and communication received by T  fall outside of the remit of what this service is permitted 
to look at, and I will not consider these aspects of Ts complaint further. 
The aspect of Ts complaint that I can consider  which relates to the third complaint raised 
by T which was responded to by NatWest in October 2020  is whether NatWests actions 
when trying to recover the sent money on Ts behalf were fair and reasonable.
T has noted that when it first contacted NatWest and advised that the money had been sent 
to incorrect bank details, NatWest asked T to wait 24 hours to see if the sent money would 
bounce back to Ts account. When this didnt happen, T called NatWest again, but it was 
only the next day  and two days from T first informing NatWest that the money had been 
sent to the wrong bank details  that NatWest first approached the recipients bank and 
sought to recover the money.
I can appreciate Ts frustration here, but I dont feel that the concerns that T has with the 
time taken by NatWest to first approach the recipient bank has any significant bearing on the 
outcome here. 
I say this because the sent money was located by the recipient bank, and it was the recipient 
bank that then made the decision not to return the located money to NatWest as per 
NatWests request. And Im satisfied, given that NatWest were dependent on the recipient 
bank returning the money to them, that the money would have been located and that the 
outcome would have been the same even if NatWest approached the recipient bank a day 
earlier.
Finally, it also must be noted that NatWests actions when seeking to recover the sent 
money for T were inline with the terms of Ts business account, as per the below:
If you give us incorrect payment details (for example, the wrong sort code or account
number) then, once youve told us, well make reasonable efforts to recover your 
payment for you, but we may not be able to recover the payment and we may charge 
you a fee for trying to recover it. If were unable to recover the payment, we wont 
refund you. If the payment has been received by the payees bank you should 
contact them for a refund.In this instance, NatWest did contact the recipients bank, and the sent money was located. 
So, Im satisfied that NatWest did make reasonable efforts to recover the money for T. 
However, it was as a result of a decision made by the recipients bank  over which NatWest 
have no control  that the money ultimately wasnt returned to NatWest, and Im satisfied 
that this isnt something for which I could fairly or reasonably hold NatWest accountable. 
I realise that this wont be the outcome that T was wanting here, but it follows that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action at this time. I trust 
that T will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I 
have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2021.
