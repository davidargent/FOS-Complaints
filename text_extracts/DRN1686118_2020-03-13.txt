K821x#15complaint
Miss C says Elevate Credit International Limited   trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about 6 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss C between  October  2015  
and June 2016. Miss Cs borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Max Repayment
1 25/10/2015 08/04/2016 12 £300.00 £137.79
2 12/11/2015 21/12/2015 12 £150.00 £204.66
3 25/11/2015 18/12/2015 12 £200.00 £294.48
4 18/12/2015 08/04/2016 12 £500.00 £291.68
5 23/12/2015 03/06/2016 12 £200.00 £306.94
6 02/06/2016 23/04/2018 12 £600.00 £267.81
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Cs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 3 
onwards shouldnt have been  given because the combined repayments for her outstanding 
loans were a significant  portion of Miss Cs income. Sunny disagreed and said the amount 
Miss C was borrowing  was manageable  given  her disposable income.  But it did offer to 
uphold loan 6. Miss C rejected Sunnys offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN16861182the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint. Having  done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 and 2.    
Miss C didnt respond to the view. As there  is no longer a dispute  about these loans, I wont 
be making any further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 3 to Miss C and the results of these  
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Miss Cs third loan in a month,  I think 
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Miss Cs finances  before 
lending her this loan. 
I say this because  at the time of taking  out loan 3, loans  1 and 2 remained outstanding. So, 
although Miss C was borrowing £200,  which was due to be repaid in 12 bi-weekly 
instalments payment plus interest, Miss C was also committed  to repaying her instalments 
for loans  1 and 2 as well. The total highest amount came to around £295 and this would 
have been from her monthly income of £1,083.  
The highest  total repayment represented  a significant proportion  of Miss Cs income and I 
think Sunny  ought  to have realised this and the potential for Miss C to struggle to make the 
repayment. Given Miss Cs income  and borrowing, it seems  there  was a significant chance  
of Miss C having to borrow  again  to meet her commitment under this loan. 
The highest  monthly commitment continued  to be a significant portion of Miss Cs income 
for loans  4 and 5 as well. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN16861183Given the circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss C was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss C had taken out six loans in eight months  and had been  
indebted to Sunny  for the whole of that time.  So Sunny ought to have  realised it was 
more likely that Miss Cs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably. 
Miss Cs first loan was for £300  and loan 6 was for double that amount. By now 
Sunny should  have  known that it was unlikely Miss C was borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
She also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. As 
mentioned above, loan 6 was taken out eight months after loan 1 and for a larger  
amount. Miss C had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss C lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 6 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness  by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
The length of time over which Miss C borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on loans 3 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 from Miss Cs credit file;
any information recorded about  loan 6 is adverse. So, all entries about loan 6 should 
be removed from Miss Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss C a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN16861184my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 April 2020.
