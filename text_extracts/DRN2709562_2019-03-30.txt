K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that Uncle Buck Financial LLP (Uncle Buck)  didnt carry out proper affordability  
checks and shouldnt have agreed to lend him 9 loans  as he couldnt pay them back.

of his borrowing  is as follows;

Uncle Buck  says for each loan, it took account  of the information  Mr B gave  along  with a 
credit file assessment.  It considered his credit score which it says was acceptable.  It said 
Mr Bs income well exceeded his monthly  expenditure  and all the loans were  in its opinion, 
affordable. That said Uncle  Buck did make an offer to repay interest  and reverse any 
adverse credit history  for loans 4, 5 and 6.
Our adjudicator felt this complaint should be partly  upheld. She said that Uncle Buck  had 
carried out proportionate checks for loan 1. But she didnt think their checks for loans 2 and 
3 were sufficient. She concluded though that Mr B would have been able to afford  the 
repayments for these  2 loans anyway if Uncle Buck had carried  out what she felt were 
proportionate checks. 
Our adjudicator then outlined the offer that Uncle Buck had made for loans 4 to 6 and went 
on to say that they didnt carry out sufficient  checks for loans 7-9. She said that if Uncle Buck  
had carried out a full review  of Mr Bs finances  then it would  have seen that he couldnt  
afford to make  the repayments  for loans 7 and 8 but would have been able to afford loan 9.
Uncle Buck  didnt agree with our adjudicators view. It reiterated its offer to pay 
compensation for loans 4, 5 and 6 and says its offer is fair.
Mr B hasnt accepted  this offer.  As both parties cannot agree this complaint has been  
passed to me to make a decision.
Ref: DRN27095622my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loan was offered. 
I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Uncle  Buck,  at the time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mr B would be able to repay in a sustainable  way?
If not, would  those checks have shown that Mr B would have been able to do so.
Taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was otherwise unsustainable or harmful?
Did Uncle  Buck  act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
If I determine that Uncle Buck did not act fairly  and reasonably in its dealings with Mr B and 
that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider  what  is fair compensation.
Uncle Buck  was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether Mr B 
could afford  to pay back the loan before it lent to him. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr B was borrowing and the length of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks Uncle Buck  had to do.
Before lending to Mr B, Uncle Buck had to make  sure each loan was affordable.  There  arent  
set checks it had to carry out. But its checks shouldve been  proportionate to things like  but 
not limited to  the size of the loan, the repayments and what  Uncle Buck  knew  about him.
Uncle Buck  says it asked  about Mr Bs income and expenditure and did a credit check  and 
used his credit score  each  time. It says it relied on the information  he gave.
I agree  with the adjudicator that the checks  Uncle Buck carried  out on loan 1 went far 
enough. He was a new customer and the loan repayment appeared affordable  on the 
information Uncle Buck had available.
Mr B took out loan 2 on 01/09/2014 and then almost  a month later took out loan 3 on 
30/09/2014. I think for these two loans, Uncle Buck should have carried out further checks 
and also looked  into what sort of short  term lending  commitments  Mr B held at the time each  
loan was granted. I say this because the repayment amounts for loans 2 and 3 were 
significantly higher  than the first loan and Mr B had started to borrow  in regular short  
intervals. That being said, if Uncle Buck had carried out proportionate checks it would have 
still seen that Mr B could  afford the repayments for these 2 loans. Mr B declared his monthly  
income to be £2475 and his expenditure  as £450. His short  term commitments  around the 
time of both loans was no more than £600  leaving  him enough disposable income  to be able 
to afford the repayments when they fell due. So I think Mr B would have been able to afford 
loans 2 and 3 even if Uncle Buck had carried out sufficient  checks.
Ref: DRN27095623By the time Mr B applied  for loan 4 hed been borrowing regularly for 3 months. By this 
stage, I think Mr Bs pattern  of borrowing suggested  he mayve been  becoming reliant  on 
these loans. And so with this in mind, I think it wouldve been reasonable and proportionate 
for Uncle Buck to have asked more questions  and carried out more  checks.  For loans 4 to 9 
I think Uncle Buck should have been considering carrying out a full review of Mr Bs financial 
circumstances.
As I have already  concluded, Uncle Buck should  have been verifying the information Mr B 
provided from loan 4 onwards and looking into his circumstances more.  If it had done this 
when it granted  loans  4-8, it would  have seen he held a number of other financial 
commitments and also gambling expenditure. And when  these  amounts are considered  
alongside Mr Bs normal  living  costs, I cant see that he had enough disposable income  to 
afford the loan repayments from loan 4 to loan 8. These 5 loans  werent sustainable.
Mr B was consistently making gambling  payments that when added  to his expenditure meant 
that he had no disposable income to make the repayments when they were  due for loans 4 
to 8. So if Uncle Buck had carried  out further checks  for these 5 loans it would have seen 
that they were  not affordable for him.
Mr B took out loan 9 a few months after loan 8 had been repaid. I have already concluded 
Uncle Buck  should  have  carried out detailed checks for this loan also and should  have  been  
verifying the information Mr B was giving them. But if it had done this for loan 9 then it would 
have found that this loan was affordable for Mr B. This is because  I can see that at this stage 
Mr B was no longer  making any gambling transactions.  This meant that he had disposable  
income to be able to meet  the monthly repayments when they became due for loan 9. So I 
think Mr B would have been  able to afford  loan 9 and Uncle Buck would  have seen this if it 
had carried out sufficient checks.
Taking everything into account  I dont think Uncle Buck has shown its checks for loans 4 to 8 
were sufficient or proportionate  given Mr Bs borrowing  history  or, the amounts borrowed. 
I consider proportionate  checks would have shown Uncle Buck that Mr B couldnt afford to 
repay loans  4 to 8.
On balance I dont  think loans 4 to 8 shouldve been granted. Uncle Buck  should  put right 
what it did wrong.
putting things right
I dont think Uncle Buck should  have agreed to give loans  4 to 8. So Uncle Buck  should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to loans 4 to 8.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Bs credit  file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN27095624my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct Uncle  Buck Finance LLP 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2019.
