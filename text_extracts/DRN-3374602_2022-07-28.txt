The complaint
Mrs A and Mr Y complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for a timeshare trial membership.
What happened
Mrs A and Mr Y entered into a trial membership agreement in June 2019 for the right to 
reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years with a timeshare company  and 
Mr Y says that an additional bonus week was also offered. The price of the trial membership 
was £4,395 which they paid using a loan from Shawbrook Bank. They signed a fixed sum 
loan agreement for that amount which they agreed to repay by 12 monthly instalments of 
£366.25.
They booked a holiday but it was cancelled because of the restrictions imposed in response 
to the pandemic and they then had difficulties in booking a holiday. They complained to the 
timeshare company and then complained to Shawbrook Bank in November 2020. It said that 
theyd signed documents about the trial membership and the loan, there was no evidence 
that theyd sought to cancel their membership within the 14 day cooling off period and they 
wouldve been aware of the financial commitment that they were agreeing to by joining such 
a club.
Mrs A and Mr Y werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She didnt consider that 
there had been a misrepresentation by the timeshare company or that the relationship 
between Shawbrook Bank and Mrs A and Mr Y was unfair and she said that the evidence 
available didnt appear to support their claim for a refund under the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She said that the loan agreement showed the correct amount of the loan as £4,395 
and that it was interest free. She also said that there was a delay in Mrs A and Mr Y 
receiving the final response letter from Shawbrook Bank but she didnt think that it had 
impacted them in bringing their complaint to this service.
Mrs A and Mr Y have asked for their complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. They 
have responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and Mr Y says, in summary 
and amongst other things that:
theyre facing financial problems and feel that the timeshare company wasnt fair to 
them when selling the trial membership;
the company that sold it went into administration;
they signed the trial membership agreement in June 2019 but he had to wait for his 
certificate to be able to book a holiday and he didnt receive it until more than three 
weeks later and when he tried to book a holiday the first availability was in May 2020 
 and if theyd known that they wouldnt have chosen the trial membership but they 
werent able to cancel it then;
they booked travel for the holiday but it was cancelled and they lost money;
Shawbrook Bank has provided them with wrong financial information; and
theyre prepared to pay the profit that Shawbrook Bank expected to make from them 
but dont want any further relationship with it or the timeshare company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the sale of a holiday membership by a timeshare company isnt an activity that this 
service can investigate directly but, in certain circumstances, section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs A and Mr Ys complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare 
company and that Shawbrook Banks response to their claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs A and Mr Ys claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs A and Mr Y signed a trial membership agreement with the timeshare company in 
June 2019 for the right to reserve a five holiday weeks within the following three 
years (and I understand that there was also an additional bonus week)  and they 
also signed the trial membership agreement conditions and a document containing 
the form of withdrawal notice;
the trial membership agreement said, immediately above their signatures, that they 
agreed:  to be bound by this Agreement and the Membership Agreement 
Conditions as stated overleaf and the Trial Membership Regulations, Rules of 
Occupation of the Club and ancillary documents  and acknowledge receipt of the 
Information Statement ;
the right to withdraw from the agreement within 14 days was clearly set out in the 
documents that they signed and they had signed the standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given  and they had agreed that: The consumer has the right to 
withdraw from this contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason;
Mrs A and Mr Y also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank 
to pay for the trial membership, the amount of the loan was £4,395, it was interest 
free and they agreed to repay it by 12 monthly instalments of £366.25;
Mr Y says that he couldnt book a holiday until the membership certificate had been 
received and then when he received it he tried to book a holiday but the first 
availability wasnt until May 2020 and it was then too late to withdraw from the 
agreement;
Mr Y says that he booked that holiday and paid for travel but the holiday was then 
cancelled because of the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and he 
lost money that hed paid for travel;
he also says that the company that sold the trial membership to them has stopped 
trading;
I sympathise with Mrs A and Mr Y for the issues that theyve had with their trial 
membership but they didnt withdraw from the agreement within the 14 day 
withdrawal period, Ive seen no evidence to show that they were told that theyd be able to book a holiday before May 2020 and the holiday was cancelled because of 
the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and not because of any fault by 
the timeshare company;
the agreement didnt include travel and I dont consider that the timeshare company 
or Shawbrook Bank is liable for the money that Mrs A and Mr Y have lost for the 
travel costs for the cancelled holiday;
I understand that the timeshare company has stopped trading but a related company 
has continued to provide the trial membership, the holidays have continued to be 
available to Mrs A and Mr Y and Shawbrook Bank says that the related company has 
confirmed that the trial membership has been extended to January 2025 but Mrs A 
and Mr Y have made no further attempts to book a holiday;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the trial membership 
agreement was misrepresented to Mrs A and Mr Y and I dont consider that the 
difficulties that Mr Y has described are enough to be a breach of contract for which 
Shawbrook Bank would be liable under section 75;
Ive also considered whether there was an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Mr Y and Shawbrook Bank in these arrangements as section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mrs A and Mr Y and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances and I 
consider it be unlikely that a court would find that the relationship was unfair;
Mr Y says that Shawbrook Bank has provided them with wrong financial information 
and its clear that its final response letter to them did say that the total amount 
payable by them was £5,202.36  but the loan agreement correctly showed that the 
total amount payable by them was £4,395  I consider that the reference to 
£5,202.36 was a mistake by Shawbrook Bank and I consider that Mrs A and Mr Y 
ought reasonably to have known that the total amount payable by them was £4,395 
and Ive seen no evidence to show that Shawbrook Bank has tried to collect more 
than that amount from them;
Mr Y has also complained about the customer service that hes received from 
Shawbrook Bank and that it took it more than eight weeks to respond to his complaint 
 Mrs A and Mr Ys complaint was made to this service in February 2021 and I dont 
consider that any delay by Shawbrook Bank in responding to them has significantly 
impacted their complaint and Im not persuaded that the customer service that 
theyve received from it has fallen below a reasonably acceptable standard;
Mr Y has referred to the financial difficulties that he and Mrs A are experiencing  if 
they havent already done so I suggest that they contact Shawbrook Bank to explain 
their financial difficulties - its required to respond to any such difficulties positively 
and sympathetically;
its clear that Mr Y feels strongly that he and Mrs A have been treated unfairly by the 
timeshare company and Shawbrook Bank and I sympathise with them for the issues 
that theyve had with the timeshare company and Shawbrook Bank and their financial 
difficulties, but I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs A and Mr Ys claim 
was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to 
refund to Mrs A and Mr Y any of the money that theyve paid for the trial membership, 
to write-off all or any part of their debt, to pay them any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs A and Mr Ys complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A and Mr Y to 
accept or reject my decision before 25 August 2022.
