The complaint
Mrs A complains that Oplo PL Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for some 
holiday club membership credits under a fixed sum loan agreement. Her husband is also 
involved with her complaint.
What happened
Mrs A entered into a fixed sum loan agreement that she electronically signed in August 2018 
to pay for some holiday club membership credits. The price of the credits was £30,000 and 
the loan was for that amount. Mrs A agreed to make 179 monthly payments of £306.24 and 
a final payment of £307.22 to the finance provider. 
Mrs A says that she raised mis-selling concerns with the finance provider, using a third-party, 
in November 2019 but the finance provider says that its been unable to locate any 
correspondence about Mrs As concerns from November 2019. Mrs A did complain to the 
finance provider in April 2021 and said that the loan was sold as an investment to be sold in 
January 2020 which hadnt happened so shed stopped her loan repayments in March 2020. 
The finance provider said that the credits werent marketed as anything other than credits 
which can be exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a 
yacht or use of other lifestyle products. It said that the resale facility for the credits would be 
available from 2023 and they shouldnt be considered to be an investment. It said that the 
management company had ceased to trade but a new management company had been 
appointed to service the membership in accordance with Mrs As contract. 
Mrs A wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. She says that she was 
forced to sign the loan agreement and that the holiday company refused to sell the 
investment. Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said 
that shed seen no evidence to suggest that a complaint was sent to the finance provider in 
November 2019. She wasnt persuaded that there had been a misrepresentation at the time 
of sale and she said that shed not seen evidence to suggest that the loan was mis-sold to 
Mrs A.
Mrs A has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that the 
salesman convinced her that the credits were an investment linked to a timeshare and were 
a better investment to pay off her and her husbands loans and realise a profit. She says 
that, after she cancelled her loan repayments, the holiday company said that the credits 
would be used to pay off the loan and, in January 2021, it sold some of her credits  so the 
sale of the credits started before 2023. Mrs As loan has been transferred to Oplo and it has 
assumed the finance providers obligations under the loan agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Ive seen no evidence to support what Mrs A says about a claim being made by a 
third-party to the finance provider in November 2019 so Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the finance provider acted incorrectly in 
connection with any such claim;
Mrs A used credit, in the form of the loan from the finance provider, to pay for the 
credits and Ive considered the complaint that shes made to this service under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs As claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs A has also referred to another finance provider  but her complaint is made 
about the loan that was made to her in August 2018 by the finance provider (and 
which has now been transferred to Oplo) and Im unable to consider any issues 
relating to another finance provider in this decision;
Ive only been provided with limited information about the purchase of the credits in 
August 2018 but the finance provider has provided the rules and trust deed relating 
to the credits and the standard information form that was provided to purchasers; 
it has also provided evidence from the holiday company which says that Mrs A 
attended a compliance interview where every aspect of her purchase was explained 
to her prior to signing the documentation and that she received copies of all the 
contractual documentation, including the right to withdraw and 14 day cooling-off 
period but it didnt receive any cancellation request so the loan was activated;
the standard information form says The resale facility will be available to be applied 
for as of the year 2023 and cannot be relied upon as the basis for entering into a 
Membership. Resale values or timeframes cannot be guaranteed and are subject to 
offer and demand;
Mrs A has provided extracts from her husbands correspondence with the holiday 
company in July 2020 and January 2021 in response to his e-mail about the direct 
debit payment being cancelled in which it says: Your pending loan balance can be 
set off against some of your [credits]; and: I can take 2300 [credits] and close off the 
loan you have with us. Later on you can also list some of your [credits] for resale. 
Regarding the annual membership fee for 2021 which is £1,500, we can deduct the 
yearly minimum usage of 1000 [credits] and set it off against the fee;
that correspondence was with the holiday company and not with the finance provider 
 Mrs As loan was with the finance provider and I dont consider that the holiday 
company would have been discussing the terms of the loan repayments with Mrs A 
or her husband  I consider it to be more likely that those extracts relate to annual 
membership fees that would have been payable by Mrs A to the holiday company;Ive seen no evidence to show that the finance provider agreed that the credits could 
be sold to clear (or reduce) Mrs As loan from it; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to support Mrs As claims that the 
credits were sold to her as an investment - I consider it to be more likely than not that 
Mrs B had agreed that the resale facility wouldnt be available until 2023 and I dont 
consider that the e-mails from the holiday company are enough to show that it was 
operating a resale facility in January 2021;
Mrs A has provided an extract from a communication from the new holiday company 
in which it said that it was creating a new resale service which it expected to launch 
some months later  but that doesnt show that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company;
I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs A was induced into 
buying the credits and entering into the loan agreement by misrepresentations made 
by the holiday company or that the credits or the loan were mis-sold to her;
the holiday company has stopped trading which would be a breach of contract, but 
the holiday club is now operated by another holiday company and I understand that 
Mrs A has kept all her rights under her contract and that the other holiday company 
continues to offer a full service for members;
I consider that to be a suitable remedy for the breach of contract and Im not 
persuaded that Oplo would have any further liability to Mrs A under section 75 arising 
from that breach of contract; 
Mrs A referred in her complaint form to being forced to sign the loan agreement but 
she hadnt referred to that in her complaint to the finance company in April 2020 and 
Ive seen no evidence to support such a claim  so Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Mrs A was forced to sign the loan agreement or that 
she was unduly pressured into buying the credits or entering into the loan agreement; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationship 
between Mrs A and the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would find the relationship to be unfair;
I consider that the finance providers response to Mrs As complaint was fair and 
reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mrs A;
Mrs A has provided a copy of an e-mail from Oplo that she received in November 
2022 in which it said that the arrears on her account were £9,493.44  I suggest that 
Mrs A contacts Oplo to try to agree a repayment arrangement for the amount that 
she owes to it, and if shes experiencing financial difficulties she should explain those 
difficulties to Oplo  its required to respond to any such difficulties positively and 
sympathetically; and 
I sympathise with Mrs A for the issues that shes described but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Oplo to refund to her 
any of the money that she paid for the holiday club membership credits, to cancel her 
loan, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or reject my decision before 20 March 2023.
