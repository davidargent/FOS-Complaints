The complaint
Mr Y is unhappy as he feels the compensation offered by National Westminster Bank Plc 
does not go far enough to address problems hes experienced with his mortgage 
repayments. 
What happened
Mr Y has a number of accounts with NatWest including a mortgage and current account.
In 2020 and early 2021, Mr Ys income was impacted by the pandemic. NatWest provided 
assistance by deferring payments. Mr Y and NatWest then agreed a repayment plan, based 
on increased monthly repayments, to bring his account back up to date over the next several 
months.
Mr Ys mortgage payment was being collected on the fifth of each month. Mr Y has said that 
in April 2021, he tried to amend his repayment date online, and move it to the twentieth of 
the month. 
He contacted NatWest on 5 May 2021, as he hadnt received any confirmation that the 
change had been made. And he was worried that the mortgage repayment was still due to 
be taken, as this could impact his other direct debit payments due that day.
NatWest said it didnt have any record of the requested change but didnt doubt Mr Y had 
tried to make it. NatWest ensured that the mortgage payment was not collected and the 
other direct debits went through as scheduled. It also arranged to change the payment date. 
But Mr Y was required to make a manual payment for May 2021, as the direct debit wouldnt 
be set up in time. This manual payment was made on 2 June 2021.
Mr Y made a complaint at the time about the original change not being actioned. NatWest 
apologised and offered Mr Y £120 for the distress caused  which was paid directly to his 
NatWest current account.
Mr Y then requested that his payment actually be collected at the end of the month. So, the 
direct debit date was amended and the scheduled payment for June was taken on 30 June 
2021.
There was an issue with the July payment, as Mr Y thought hed already made a payment in 
July. He called NatWest and it again agreed not to collect this. A manual payment was made 
on 5 August 2021 to put the account into the correct position.
NatWest wrote to Mr Y around the same time indicating his account was in arrears and his 
credit file would be impacted. It also indicated that at the end of August itd be taking double 
the usual monthly mortgage payment to account for this. Mr Y contacted NatWest about this 
as he felt his account was up to date. The agents he spoke to agreed he was not in arrears. 
And the payment taken at the end of August was the usual contractual amount.
Mr Y complained to NatWest. He said NatWest had made a number of errors and had been 
unable to provide a clear picture of what was happening with his account. He said this has 
caused him significant distress. He said, because of NatWest saying his credit file would be 
impacted hed had to sign up to receive his credit report, at a cost. And he also said hed lost 
confidence in NatWests handling of his accounts, so hed moved money out of his account 
as he didnt trust NatWest not to take money it wasnt due. He said this had resulted in him 
having to make manual payments in respect of other bills. And this had meant some 
payments had been made late to one creditor in particular, and this had been recorded on 
his credit file. Which in turn would impact him when trying to move house.
NatWest agreed that the service it had provided had not been good enough and that 
administrative errors had been made. It confirmed that it would ensure no negative 
information was recorded on Mr Ys credit file in respect of his mortgage account. And Mr Y 
has provided evidence that shows this was done. NatWest also initially said it would pay 
Mr Y a further £250 for the upset caused and to pay him £120 to cover six months of fees for 
accessing his credit report. And I can see £370 was credited to his current account on 
1 October 2021. Mr Y remained unhappy and contacted NatWest again. On further review it 
increased this offer and said it would pay another £150  which I can again see was credited 
to Mr Ys current account.
Mr Y said he still felt this did not reflect the trouble hed been put to or address the issues 
with his other creditors. So, he asked our service to look into his complaint.
One of our Investigators considered matters. She thought the total offer made by NatWest, 
£520 for the upset caused and £120 to cover the cost of Mr Y signing up for credit reference 
information, was fair in the circumstances. And although she understood Mr Y had lost 
confidence in NatWest, she didnt think it had caused the issues hed had with other 
creditors.
Mr Y did not agree. He said NatWests actions were directly the cause of the problems with 
other creditors and that he was being penalised. He also still felt the compensation offered 
by NatWest wasnt enough.
As Mr Y did not agree with our Investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to me 
to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has accepted that Mr Y did likely attempt to amend his payment date in April 2021. 
And that, as a result, the payment for May shouldve been scheduled for a later date. But 
with the exception of that payment, I cant see that NatWest has made a mistake in respect 
of the other payments it has taken. Because of the issues in May 2021, that payment due 
that month was eventually made manually in early June. The June payment was then 
correctly requested as well and paid by direct debit. A payment was then due in July. The 
direct debit payment for this was cancelled as it appears that Mr Y thought it was being 
duplicated. But that wasnt the case. This was rectified with another manual payment in early 
August 2021. And then the correct contractual repayment was taken at the end of August, 
again by direct debit. So, across the four months, four mortgage payments were made.NatWest has not recorded any adverse information on Mr Ys credit file in respect of this. 
Which I think was fair. And I dont think NatWest has at any stage taken more than it should 
have from Mr Ys current account for his mortgage payments. Im conscious as well that the 
mortgage payment scheduled for 5 May 2021 was postponed after Mr Y complained  and 
the other direct debit payments due from his current account that day were honoured.
It isnt in dispute though that NatWests communication around what has happened has 
been poor. Mr Y spoke to NatWest a number of times, and it doesnt appear the people he 
spoke to fully understood the situation with the account, so couldnt explain exactly what had 
happened  although they did correctly say he wasnt in arrears. NatWest also appears to 
have written to him saying he was in arrears  when that wasnt the case. And the alerts it 
sent him about how much would be collected via direct debit, didnt reflect the correct, up to 
date position of his mortgage at the time they were sent. NatWest has agreed it couldve 
handled things much better than it has. So, what is left for me to decide is what a fair way to 
address this is.
Mr Y has said he signed up for credit reference information, because NatWest indicated it 
was going to record information about late or missed payments on his credit file. As Ive 
mentioned NatWest hasnt actually done so. But I understand why Mr Y felt that he needed 
to check this. I can see though that NatWest has offered Mr Y £120, to cover the cost of the 
credit reference service for six months. In the circumstances, I think that is fair.
Mr Y has said that the problems he has encountered have caused him issues with other 
creditors  one in particular  through him making payments late. He said he became 
concerned, as the issues continued, that NatWest was going to take payments it wasnt due. 
So, he opened a separate current account elsewhere and moved money to that account, 
only moving it back when scheduled payments were due. And a knock-on effect was he had 
to make some payments manually, which were made after the due date, with other creditors.
I understand why Mr Y was concerned. As Ive said, NatWest was giving him different, often 
conflicting information. And I can see why he felt NatWest didnt understand what the correct 
position of his account should be. But I dont think I can say it is responsible for payments 
elsewhere being missed. 
As Ive explained, I dont think NatWest took more than it should have from Mr Ys current 
account. So, it doesnt appear to have left him with less money than he shouldve had, to 
make his payments, at any stage. He has said he lost confidence in NatWest, and so didnt 
want to leave money in his NatWest current account and moved it elsewhere. I can 
understand why he lost confidence as NatWest does appear to have sent incorrect 
information about how much was potentially due. But it didnt ultimately request these 
amounts. So, didnt leave him short of money. And if he moved money away from NatWest 
to control the amount available in his NatWest current account, he still had access to those 
funds. So, it isnt clear why the payments to other creditors were made late, if the funds were 
always available.
Mr Y has said other creditors have indicated that they accept NatWest was at fault for late 
payments, when he has contacted them. But based on the information Ive seen, I dont think 
it was.
Taking all of this into account, I dont think NatWest needs to do anything further in respect 
of the issues Mr Y has had with other creditors. And it follows I dont think NatWest is 
responsible for the impact those payments being made late may have on Mr Y moving 
forward.Mr Y has said that he has been caused significant amounts of stress and inconvenience as a 
result of what has happened. I can see he has made numerous calls to NatWest, which he 
otherwise likely wouldnt have needed to. And he was given conflicting information at times, 
which I dont doubt was frustrating and confusing. Mr Y has also said he felt he needed to 
manage his money differently as he couldnt trust NatWest  although NatWest didnt 
suggest this was needed and this seems to have been Mr Ys personal choice. With all of 
this in mind, I do think he was likely caused distress and inconvenience, unnecessarily.
NatWest has offered a total of £520 for the upset caused by the poor service it provided. 
Mr Y says that he doesnt think this goes far enough. 
NatWest has handled matters poorly. And it couldve done a better job of getting a more 
cohesive picture of exactly what was happening with his accounts. So, I understand why 
Mr Y had concerns. But NatWest hasnt collected incorrect payments. And so, while Im 
sorry to disappoint Mr Y, based on what Ive seen, in the individual circumstances of this 
complaint, I think NatWests offer is fair and I dont require it to do any more.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2022.
