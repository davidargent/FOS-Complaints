The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA allowed him to use his accounts with 
them to gamble extensively without any interventions or checks. Mr G also complains that 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA breached their own terms and conditions by permitting him 
to use multiple accounts. 
What happened
Mr G opened two personal accounts with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal). He 
says that PayPal allowed him to send £110,000 to one betting company over a roughly five-
year period between 2013 and 2018. Mr G also says he was allowed to make payments 
from his primary account to his secondary account which breached PayPals own rules.
Mr G complained to PayPal about these issues, however they didnt uphold his complaint. 
PayPal said, in summary, that Mr Gs accounts were verified in line with their terms and that 
there was no limit to the amount of money he could send from these, subject to a potential 
limit on a single transaction. 
As Mr G didnt agree with this, he referred his complaint to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into what had happened and upheld the complaint. He said, again in 
summary, that PayPal had failed to spot that Mr G was vulnerable due to the way hed 
managed the accounts and that there was a pattern of spending which should have 
prompted PayPal to contact Mr G and potentially offer some help or support. Our 
investigator said that PayPal should pay £500 to Mr G. 
Mr G didnt disagree in principle with the investigators proposed recommendation although 
did say he wasnt sure that £500 adequately reflected the distress and turmoil PayPals 
actions had caused. Mr G did though say that PayPal had breached their own terms by 
allowing him to open and use two personal accounts and didnt know how PayPal verified 
one of these bearing in mind it was linked to a dormant account. Mr G also referenced the 
Consumer Rights Act 2015 and its requirements for PayPal to carry out services with 
reasonable care and skill, which he felt they hadnt adhered to.
PayPal didnt agree saying that, at the time, they had no way of flagging any of their 
accounts as vulnerable and that Mr G didnt tell them about his vulnerability. So, they felt 
they couldnt have offered him any support. 
As agreement between the parties couldnt be reached, Mr Gs complaint has been passed 
to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, it seems to me the first thing I need to do is establish whether I find that 
PayPal should reasonably have been aware Mr G was vulnerable and in need of additional 
support. 
It seems to me that PayPal has sent somewhat contradictory information to us about how 
they act with regards to vulnerable, and potentially vulnerable, customers. On the one hand, 
theyve said to us that they were able to flag a customers account when they identified a 
vulnerable customer, provided the customer gave them consent to record their data. And 
that in extreme situations, they were able to record a vulnerability without explicit consent 
from their customer. On the other hand, PayPal said in response to our investigators view, 
that they werent able to flag Mr Gs accounts as vulnerable at the time of the activity on 
them.
Irrespective of this, PayPal hasnt said that they had no obligation to offer any kind of support 
or help to vulnerable customers. So, Im satisfied that they were able to offer this to Mr G. 
PayPal has said on more than one occasion that Mr G didnt tell them he was vulnerable. I 
dont though agree that it was solely incumbent on Mr G to have done this. While I 
appreciate it is easier for businesses like PayPal when consumers self-identify as 
vulnerable, I think its fair to say that there is also an understanding that vulnerable 
consumers may not be able to do this at the height of their vulnerability. 
I think there were clear signs from the activity on Mr Gs accounts that he was vulnerable 
and struggling to control his spending. Ive seen, for example, four receipts PayPal sent to 
Mr G between September 2018 and December 2018, where payments totalling £15,000 had 
been sent to the betting company in question. Ive also seen evidence of Mr Gs deposit 
history to one of his accounts where a total of just under £68,000 was deposited between 
December 2017 and December 2018 which Mr G says (and PayPal hasnt disputed) that he 
used to gamble. It doesnt appear disputed either that Mr G was able to send a total of 
around £110,000 to the betting company from his PayPal account over the course of around 
five years. 
Mr Gs pattern of gambling was, in my view, extreme, particularly during December 2017 and 
December 2018. It certainly doesnt strike me as activity that was being well-controlled and 
used purely for entertainment. Given this, I think PayPal should have been alerted to the fact 
that, in all likelihood, Mr Gs gambling had become problematic.
My impression though is that PayPal wouldnt have done anything unless Mr G had 
specifically contacted them to say he was vulnerable and using his accounts to gamble 
excessively and uncontrollably. Ive already set out above why I dont think it was solely his 
responsibility to do this. I would only add that PayPals position on acting upon contact from 
Mr G was a choice and decision made by PayPal. There was nothing to prevent them from 
seeing the activity on the account and contacting Mr G to talk about this. And, for the 
reasons Ive set out above, I think they should have done so and that this should have 
happened at the latest during the period where this cumulative spend was at its highest, 
which was during 2018. 
So, Im satisfied that there was a failing on the part of PayPal here and that this warrants 
compensation for Mr G. I think it reasonable to say that PayPals failure to identify what was 
happening on Mr Gs accounts and to offer some sort of potential help or support led to him 
suffering additional distress by continuing to gamble using his PayPal accounts knowing the 
further financial and emotional detriment this would cause (and indeed did cause). Overall, I 
think £500 is a fair award in recognition of this. I cant though be reasonably certain that Mr G would have stopped gambling even if he had 
been prevented from doing so in some way from his PayPal accounts. This wasnt money 
that PayPal had lent Mr G and they cant be held responsible for other lenders deciding to 
give Mr G more credit. And because PayPal didnt lend Mr G money, they were under no 
regulatory obligation to assess whether what was happening was affordable for him. So, 
with that in mind, I wont be awarding any refund of money used by Mr G to gamble through 
his PayPal accounts. 
Mr G has made some further points, including the fact that PayPal breached their own terms 
and conditions by allowing him to open two personal accounts. Weve asked PayPal about 
this and theyve said that opening two personal accounts isnt against their rules. I dont 
therefore uphold this particular point and would only add that this issue, and the points Mr G 
made about PayPal not complying with the Consumer Rights Act 2015 or how one of his 
accounts was verified when linked to a dormant account, dont make any material difference 
to my decision anyway. Ive set out why I think PayPal didnt act reasonably in how they 
dealt with Mr G and his accounts in this decision and these additional points dont change 
my thinking on that. 
Putting things right
PayPal needs to pay Mr G compensation for the distress he suffered, as directed below. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr G £500.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2022.
