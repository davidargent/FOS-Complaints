K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as aqua, imposed irrational restrictions on him 
when attempting  to make debit card payments  to his credit card account. He further 
complains about  the poor customer service he received in relation to this matter.  
To keep  matters simple,  Ill refer to NewDay in the rest of my decision. 
background
Mr D attempted to make a payment to his credit card through one of his debit cards in 
May 2019 using  NewDays online account service. The payment was unsuccessful.  Mr D 
then attempted  to make this payment on several  occasions but the payment was similarly 
unsuccessful. 
Mr D then called NewDay to query the matter and was told the payments had not gone  
through because  of the number of multiple debit cards he was using and that this was not 
permitted under NewDays policy.  
 
Unhappy with this explanation Mr D complained to NewDay  who then sent him a final 
response. Mr D then referred  his complaint to this service. One of our investigators looked 
into Mr Ds complaint and they thought NewDay had not done anything wrong. 
Mr D remained  dissatisfied and the complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done that, Ive decided  not to 
uphold Mr Ds complaint.  I know this will disappoint  Mr D, so Ill explain why. 
Mr D says that NewDays policy to decline his debit card payments was irrational. To be 
clear, my role isnt to interfere with the broader  reasons NewDay  has this payment policy in 
place. But I do have  to determine if NewDay have acted fairly and reasonably  in the 
circumstances of this individual complaint.
Mr D has provided a screenshot of the message he received when attempting this payment, 
and I note it says Your  payment  has been  unsuccessful. Maximum number of different 
payment cards has been reached for the last 30 days. Please use a card that was used 
previously or try again  on a later date.  
NewDay has given me information that shows four attempted  payments to Mr Ds credit card 
account were declined in May 2019. NewDay has also given me screenshots from its 
internal systems which show  that Mr D called it to say he couldnt make a payment with a 
third debit card. The agent Mr D spoke to has left further notes that say he told Mr D that he 
could use other methods  of payment. NewDay have also given  me information from its 
training guide  that shows a customer can only use 2 different debit cards  in any 30 day 
rolling period 
Given the above, Im satisfied from the payment attempt details Ive seen that Mr Ds 
attempted payments were  declined because  he was using  a third debit card within a 30 day 
rolling period and that this isnt permitted under NewDays policy.  
Ref: DRN13978512So, I now need to ask myself if NewDay  acted  unfairly by doing this. I note that on one of 
NewDays internal  screenshots related to Mr Ds account it says that this measure is in place 
for security reasons. Its not clear  if this information  was communicated to Mr D, but Im 
satisfied this is a plausible and credible reason for having such a payment policy in place. So 
it follows that I dont  think  NewDay did anything wrong by declining these  payments.  
I note that Mr D was made  aware he could make his payment through other  methods such  
as faster  payment. That means Mr D could have made the payment using other methods 
which wouldnt likely have  been onerous to carry out. I also note that his credit card account  
incurred 0% interest for his outstanding balance. So even if he feels he couldnt clear  his 
balance for that month, he hasnt suffered any loss financially. 
Customer service  
Mr D says he was given  mis-leading and incorrect  information  by NewDays  agent  when he 
spoke to them about why the payment was being declined. He adds that this has caused him 
distress. From the information  Ive mentioned  above  from NewDays systems, it doesnt  
appear likely  he was given incorrect or misleading information. I also note that the 
screenshot he has provided  to us also gives a clear  explanation as to why his payment 
attempts were being declined.  So because of this Im satisfied a reasonably  clear  
explanation was most likely given. 
I also note that NewDays  final response  letter was issued some  six days  after Mr D made 
his complaint. Given the expedient response  to his complaint, and what Ive said about the 
information given  to Mr D about why the payment was declined, Im satisfied NewDay  hasnt 
done anything  to have caused Mr D trouble or upset through  its customer  service.
 
Ive also considered what Mr D has said about being given a different  address to complain to 
by the agent in contrast to the aqua app.  But even if that happened, I cant  see that this has 
caused any meaningful delay to Mr D making his complaint.  
So taking everything into account, Im satisfied that NewDay  hasnt acted unfairly or 
unreasonably by declining Mr Ds payments. Nor has it caused  him any meaningful trouble 
or upset  by the way it dealt with the matter.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 December  2019.
