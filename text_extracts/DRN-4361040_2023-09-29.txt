Complaint
Mr J has complained about loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) 
provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr J with a first loan for £2,000.00 in August 2020. This loan was 
due to be repaid in 12 monthly instalments of £221.78. This loan was settled early, in          
June 2021, with some of the proceeds from loan 2. 
In June 2021, Mr J was provided with a second loan for £4,000.00. £412.86 of the proceeds 
from this loan went towards repaying the outstanding balance on loan 1. This loan had a 36-
month term with monthly repayments of £214.86. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Mr J and 118 118 Money had told us. And he thought 
that 118 118 Money hadnt done anything wrong or treated Mr J unfairly. So he didnt 
recommend that Mr Js complaint be upheld. Mr J disagreed and asked for an ombudsman 
to look at his complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Js complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Js complaint. Ill 
explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr J could afford to repay before providing this loan. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money provided Mr J with loans for £2,000.00 and £4,000.00 in December 2020 
and June 2021. These loans were due to be repaid in 12 and 36 monthly instalments 
respectively. 118 118 Money says it agreed to Mr Js applications after he provided details of 
his monthly income and some information on his expenditure. 
It says it cross-checked this against information on a credit search it carried out. And all of 
this information showed Mr J could comfortably afford to make the repayments he was 
committing to. On the other hand, Mr J has said the loans were unaffordable.
Ive carefully thought about what Mr J and 118 118 Money have said. 
The first thing for me to say is that 118 118 Money has provided a record of the results of its 
credit searches. 118 118 Money searches appear to show that Mr J did have previous 
difficulties with credit. So I do think that 118 118 Money needed to find out more about Mr Js 
regular living expenses before agreeing to provide these loans. However, Mr J hasnt been 
able to provide us with evidence of what these were at the respective times. 
Ive also kept in mind that 118 118 Money provided a second loan to Mr J and that 
sometimes repeat borrowing in itself can be an indication of difficulty. But while the amount 
advanced for loan 2 was higher, the interest rate was lower and monthly payments were less 
than what they were on loan 1  albeit I do accept that Mr J would be indebted for a longer 
period. 
So while the pattern of lending here has seen me take a closer look at the individual 
applications, Im satisfied that it wasnt immediately obvious that Mr J might have taken loan 
2 because of the effect loan 1 might have left on his finances. And there isnt anything else 
obvious in these applications which clearly demonstrates Mr J couldnt have afforded the 
loans either. 
I accept that Mr Js actual circumstances may not have been fully reflected either in the 
information he provided, or the information 118 118 Money obtained. For example, Ive seen 
that Mr J might have been in rent arrears. But the key here is that its only fair and 
reasonable for me to uphold a complaint in circumstances where a lender did something 
wrong. And I cant see how 118 118 would have known about this in circumstances where 
Mr J didnt disclose this.
Given the circumstances here, Im satisfied that 118 118 Money was reasonably entitled to 
lend to Mr J. I say this while especially mindful that we havent been provided with anything 
which demonstrates that finding out more about Mr J would clearly have shown the loan to 
be unaffordable. 
As this is the case, I dont think that 118 118 Money did anything wrong when deciding to 
lend to  Mr J  Ive not been provided with enough to satisfy me that proportionate checks 
would have shown the loans to be unaffordable. And the second loan was provided in 
circumstances where Mr Js indebtedness didnt appear to be increasing unsustainably. 
So overall I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Mr J unfairly or unreasonably when 
providing him with his loans. And Im not upholding Mr Js complaint. I appreciate this will be 
very disappointing for Mr J. But I hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and that 
hell at least feel his concerns have been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2023.
