K820x#14Complaint
Miss H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed her account. She says 
NatWests actions stopped her from being  able to access her wages.  Shes also unhappy  
about the service  she received from NatWest. She wants  NatWest  to apologise and pay her 
compensation. 
Background
Miss H had a current account with NatWest.
In March 2019, NatWest  reviewed Miss Hs account.  Following its review  NatWest  decided 
to close Miss Hs account. And on 12 March 2019,  it wrote  to her giving her 14 days notice  
to make alternative banking arrangements. NatWest also told Miss H that shed be able to 
collect her remaining account balance by going into branch with some  identification.
Miss H says the closure of her account  caused her a great  deal of stress  and inconvenience. 
And it impacted her mental health. She has explained that she was so upset she wasnt able 
to work for a couple of days. And says when she called NatWest to find out what  was 
happening with her account,  the advisor  was rude,  unhelpful and made her feel like a 
criminal.  She wants NatWest to apologise for the distress she suffered, reopen her account, 
and compensate her for the trouble  and upset shes suffered.
Miss H complained to the bank. NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong. And it had 
closed Miss Hs account in line with the account  terms and conditions.  Miss H wasnt  happy 
with this response. So, she brought her complaint to us.
An investigator looked at Miss Hs complaint.  She said NatWest hadnt done anything  wrong 
when it closed Miss Hs account. And she couldnt  find any evidence  that NatWest had 
provided Miss H with poor service when she called to discuss things. Miss H disagreed. 
Shes still upset by what happened and says when she called NatWest  the advisor was 
abrupt and hung up on her. As no agreement could be reached  the matter  has come to me 
to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from what Miss H has told us and the bank that she feels very strongly about her 
complaint. I appreciate shes upset that NatWest  closed her account.  And that this has 
caused her inconvenience. And Im sorry this experience  has made her feel unwell. But for 
me to uphold this complaint, I must be satisfied that the bank has done something wrong. 
And in this case, I dont think it has. Ill explain why. 
Ref: DRN60397492As part of its review of Miss Hs account, NatWest  carried  out further checks, which  included  
looking at information  recorded at credit  and fraud prevention agencies. And I can see that 
following completion of these checks,  NatWest  decided to close  Miss Hs account. NatWest 
wrote to Miss H on 12 March 2019, and said following a review it was no longer able to offer her 
banking services. And that her account would  be closed under the account terms and 
conditions.
Ive thought about whether NatWest  treated  Miss H unfairly when it closed her account.  From  
the information NatWest has provided I can see it believed  some of the transactions on the 
account may have  been fraudulent. So I can understand why it had concerns  about the 
operation of the account.  Ive also looked at the terms and conditions of the account, which  
permit NatWest to close an account  with 60 days notice or in some  circumstances  immediately. 
NatWest gave Miss H 14 days notice to make  alternative banking arrangements and having 
looked at the circumstances  of this case,  I think it was entitled to close the account  as it has 
already done.  So, whilst  I understand Miss H found this experience with NatWest  stressful and 
upsetting, and why she wants NatWest to pay her compensation  for closing her account,- in 
order for me to make such as award, I would have to be satisfied that the bank has acted  
unfairly. And having looked at all the evidence, I dont think  it has. 
I know Miss H is frustrated that she hasnt been  given a proper explanation why her account 
was closed.  But under  the terms and conditions NatWest doesnt  have  to give her a reason. 
So, I cant say NatWest  has done  anything wrong  by not giving Miss H this information as 
much shed like to know. 
Miss H says NatWest havent released money in her account.  And says she couldnt  access 
her wages. But Ive looked at Miss Hs statements and can see that she was able to gain 
access to her wages which were paid into the account on 13 March  2019 on the following 
day. I can also see she was able to access another set of wages she received  on 15 March 
2019 on 21 March  2019. So Im satisfied  that NatWest released Miss Hs funds. Ive also 
kept in mind that when NatWest wrote to Miss H on 12 March 2019,  it explained  that shed 
be able to access any funds remaining in the account by visiting a branch with some 
identification. I dont  find this unreasonable. I understand there is still a small balance on the 
account. As the investigator explained to Miss H, she should visit a branch to gain access  to 
these funds.
Miss H says when she called NatWest the advisor  was rude,  hung  up and made her feel like 
shed done something wrong. Ive listened  to the available  call Miss H had with NatWest,  
and I dont think the call handler intended to be rude, but he did sound abrupt and 
uninterested in what Miss H was saying. So I can understand why Miss H was upset.  I can 
see that Miss H was much happier with the service she received in branch  and that when 
NatWest wrote to Miss H in response  to her complaint, it apologised for any upset and 
inconvenience shed  been caused.  So Im not going to ask them  to do anything  more.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Miss H feels about whats happened,  and I dont doubt  
it was a frustrating and upsetting time.  So, I realise  Miss H will be disappointed by my 
decision. But overall, based on the evidence  Ive seen, I cant  say NatWest  has acted 
unreasonably and treated Miss H unfairly  when it closed her account.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN60397493Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2020.
