Miss R says MYJAR Limited lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent Miss R and MYJAR  my provisional  findings on this case on 3 February 2020. A copy  is 
attached and it forms part of this final decision.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold Miss Rs complaint and asked both parties  to let 
me know if they had anything to add. Both Miss R and MYJAR  responded to say they 
accepted my proposed outcome.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties accepted my provisional  decision,  I see no reason to depart from it. So my 
final decision  is the same  as my provisional decision, for the same  reasons.
putting things right
MYJAR must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss R paid on her loans
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year from when Miss R paid the interest 
and charges until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  the loans from Miss Rs credit history
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN87770702my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  MYJAR Limited must  put things  right by taking the steps set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 March 2020.

complaint
Miss R says MYJAR Limited lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss R had two loans with MYJAR   Ive summarised some of the details of the loans in the table 
below.
Loan no.
Amount (£) Start date End date Payment schedule (£)
1 1,000 15/05/2016 27/10/2016 1 x 138 then 5 x 315
2 1,500 30/03/2017 29/03/2018 1 x 227 then 11 x 226
Our adjudicator considered  Miss Rs complaint and didnt  recommend it be upheld.  Miss R disagreed  
with the adjudicator; she accepted his opinion in respect of the first loan but didnt think  it was fair for 
MYJAR to have agreed loan 2, given the number of defaults on her credit file. As no agreement  could 
be reached, the complaint  was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss R could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish  whether  
Miss R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ive seen that before  lending MJYAR asked Miss R for some  information  about  her income  and 
expenditure. Miss R declared  a monthly  income  of £2,000 for loan 1 and £2,100 for loan 2 and 
monthly expenditure of around £800 for both loans.  MYJAR  also carried out credit checks  and it sent 
us a summary of these.
Miss R also sent us a copy of her credit history  and from what Ive seen I have concerns about 
MYJARs decision to lend without having carried out more detailed affordability checks. This is 
principally because  of the number of defaulted loans Miss R had before taking out her MYJAR loans  
as summarised  below.

Ive seen that about four months  before  Miss R applied  for her first loan with MJYAR, shed defaulted 
on two loans  with other lenders  totalling  around £9,000. Given the size of the loans and relatively 
short time between the defaults and Miss Rs application  for loan 1, I think MYJARs checks  ought to 
have gone further  I dont  consider it was proportionate to place much weight on Miss Rs declared 
income and expenditure,  which appeared to show she had significant disposable  income, but yet was 
unable to service her existing debts. 
The credit  checks summary MYJAR has provided also doesnt provide much  insight into what  it knew 
about Miss Rs defaults  but I think its likely it wouldve been aware of them, given what  its told us 
about how it carries out credit history checks. In the circumstances, I think MJYAR ought  to have 
carried out a more  detailed affordability check  including asking Miss R for some  form of proof of her 
income and outgoings. Had MYJAR  carried out proportionate checks for loan 1, I think it likely  
wouldve seen that Miss R was borrowing from a number  of other  high-cost short-term  lenders in a 
way which suggested significant financial difficulty and was also spending significant  sums on online 
gambling  both of which ought to have meant MYJAR wouldnt have approved loan 1.
I think  MJYARs decision to approve loan 2 is even more questionable.  In the time Miss R had loan 1, 
she seems  to have defaulted on ten additional loans, from a variety of creditors,  with a total default  
balance of around £9,500  in addition  to the two defaulted loans mentioned above.  Again, I think 
MYJAR likely  knew this, given what its told us about the credit checks it carries out before lending.  
And I think it ought to have  realised from this it was unlikely Miss R was in a position to repay  the new 
loan she applied for in a sustainable manner. I also note that, had MYJAR carried  out further checks, 
as Ive described above, it wouldve seen Miss Rs financial situation had worsened since loan 1.
So, from what  Ive seen so far, I intend to uphold  Miss Rs complaint.
putting things  right
I plan to tell MYJAR to:
refund the interest and charges Miss R paid on her loans
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year from when Miss R paid the interest and 
charges until the date of settlement
remove any adverse  information about the loans from Miss Rs credit history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give 
Miss R a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  give, above, I plan to uphold this complaint and to tell MYJAR Limited to put things  
right by taking  the steps set out above.
