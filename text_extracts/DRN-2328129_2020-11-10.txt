The complaint
Mrs S complains about problems PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) experienced 
when trying to process two payments.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 7 October 2020. In my provisional decision, I explained why I didnt think this 
complaint should be upheld. I also invited Mrs S and PayPal to respond with any additional 
comments or information they wanted me to consider. I said: 
What happened
On 21 and 24 June 2019 Mrs S used PayPals pay after delivery service. The payments 
were due to be collected from Mrs S current account by direct debit 14 days later. But the 
direct debit payments didnt go through which put Mrs S PayPal account into a negative 
balance.
Mrs S has told us that on 4 July 2019 she switched her bank account using the Switching 
Service.
As the payments werent collected and an outstanding balance remained on Mrs S PayPal 
account it referred the matter to a third party debt collection business. The third party 
contacted Mrs S who repaid the outstanding balance of £420.37 on 22 August 2019.
Mrs S complained but PayPal didnt agree it had made an error. PayPal said it had 
attempted to collect the amounts owed by direct debit but the payments had been declined. 
Mrs S went on to refer her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator.
They thought PayPal should have done more to tell Mrs S about the outstanding balance 
before a third party was instructed to collect the debt and asked it to pay her £50 for the 
trouble and upset caused.
PayPal didnt agree and asked to appeal. PayPal sent evidence to show that whilst it hadnt 
specifically notified Mrs S that the direct debits hadnt gone through, she had regularly 
logged into her online account which showed a negative balance for a period of around 
seven weeks. PayPal says it has acted in line with its account terms. As PayPal asked to
appeal, Mrs S complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs S but Ive reached a different decision to the investigator. Im not 
persuaded that PayPal has made an error or treated Mrs S unfairly in the way it handled the 
direct debit payments or the subsequent collections activity. I understand how strongly Mrs 
S feels in this matter, but I think PayPal dealt with the situation fairly.
The direct debit was set up to be collected from a joint account. But Mrs S PayPal account 
was in her sole name which means only she is eligible to refer a complaint about it to our 
service.
Mrs S has told us that PayPal successfully claimed direct debits both before and after the 
issues raised here. I accept that Mrs S has successfully used direct debits to pay PayPal 
over the years. But in this case, PayPal has told us that the direct debits couldnt be 
collected and Mrs S has advised that she was switching bank accounts at the time. I 
appreciate the switch was made using the Switching Service, but PayPal has no 
involvement in that process. PayPal says it attempted to collect the direct debits but they 
were declined by Mrs S bank.
I dont know why the direct debits didnt go through, its possible that the account switch 
caused an issue. But Im satisfied that PayPal did attempt to collect the payments and 
wasnt able to do so, as it claims. As a result, Mrs S owed PayPal £420.37.
PayPal has pointed to its user agreement which says If there are insufficient funds in your 
balance to cover your liability we reserve the right to collect the amount you owe us by 
deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any payments received in or money you add 
to your PayPal account. Otherwise you agree to reimburse us through other means. We 
may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, 
through the use of a debt collection agency.
Whilst I appreciate Mrs S found the third partys contact distressing, the agreement with 
PayPal she accepted says its a step it can take where an outstanding balance remains 
unpaid. PayPal has explained it instructed the third party after Mrs S account balance 
wasnt cleared in line with her user agreement and Im satisfied there were reasonable 
grounds to take that step.
Our investigator upheld Mrs S complaint as they felt PayPal should have tried to contact 
her about the outstanding balance before they instructed the third party. But Im not 
persuaded thats a fair approach. PayPals response to the investigator pointed out that 
there is nothing in Mrs S user agreement that says it has to try and collect the outstanding 
balance from a customer directly before instructing a third party. Ive reviewed the 
agreement and can confirm PayPal is correct. In addition, PayPal provided systems 
evidence to show that Mrs S had logged into her online account on several occasions after 
her direct debit wasnt collected. PayPal says the outstanding balance wouldve been clear 
to Mrs S.
Ive reviewed the systems evidence and it does show Mrs S logged in to her account 
around six times between 11 July 2019 and 19 August 2019. Im satisfied that PayPal 
does show the account balance and that this information would have been visible to Mrs S 
when she logged in.
Mrs S raised concerns that her credit file was impacted by the situation but PayPal has 
confirmed no details about these payments were passed on to a credit reference agency. 
Im satisfied there has been no impact to Mrs S credit file.
Mrs S complains that she found it difficult to contact PayPal about the issues raised. 
PayPal, in turn, says it has a free phone number for customers to call that was working 
during this period. PayPal also says some of Mrs S emails werent sent from the email address registered on her account. Like the investigator, I think its reasonable for PayPal 
to expect to be contacted using a registered email address for security purposes. I wouldnt 
expect PayPal to correspond about a consumers account with an email address it has no 
record of.
Im not persuaded that there are grounds to award compensation in this case. I appreciate 
my decision will be disappointing to Mrs S, but I can only uphold a complaint and award 
compensation where I think the business has made an error or done something that has 
unfairly impacted a customer. I havent found that PayPal made a mistake in the way it 
tried to collect the direct debits or by instructing a third party to collect the outstanding 
balance. As a result, Im dont intend to uphold Mrs S complaint or tell PayPal to take any 
further action.
Neither Mrs S or PayPal responded with further points for me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has responded with new information I see no reason to change the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I remain of the view that PayPal didnt 
make an error when it referred Mrs S account to a third party to collect the outstanding 
balance and that it has dealt with the complaint fairly. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
