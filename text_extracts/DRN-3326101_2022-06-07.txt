The complaint
Mr P complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club memberships. 
Hes being represented by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr P and his wife entered into a membership agreement with a holiday company to buy a 
holiday club membership in June 2010. The price of the membership was £12,000 and Mr P 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for it. He 
agreed to repay the loan by 180 monthly instalments of £123.33. They bought another 
holiday club membership from a different holiday company in May 2011 (but they havent 
been able to provide a copy of their agreement with that company). The price of that 
membership was £4,000 and Mr P entered into another fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance that he signed in May 2011 to pay for it. He agreed to repay that 
loan by 120 monthly instalments of £57.20 
A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance in November 2016 that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr P and Barclays Partner Finance and that Mr P was entitled to 
damages and compensation under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The 
claim letter referred to both purchases and his representative said that the timeshare 
company was in breach of contract, didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ps financial 
position and ability to repay the loan, applied considerable pressure to procure his 
agreement to the loan, and breached EU Law. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that the purchase was made in June 2010 so Mr Ps claim 
was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so it had no obligation to investigate his 
complaint. It also said that the reference number quoted for the May 2011 purchase related 
to another customer so it didnt consider Mr Ps complaint about that purchase. Mr P wasnt 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service that the timeshare 
company and Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ps 
ability to afford the loan, Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the timeshare 
company which wasnt declared to Mr P and the timeshare company unduly pressured Mr P 
into entering into the agreements, all of which made the relationship unfair under section 
140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He said that his 
recommendations were made on the basis that the points raised about an unfair relationship 
stemmed from both purchases separately. He didnt think that this service could consider the 
complaint about any commission payments as that hadnt been raised as part of the 
complaint when the section 140A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance. He said that 
he hadnt seen anything that would suggest that the lending was unaffordable or enough 
evidence to conclude that Mr P was unfairly pressurised into the purchases.
Mr Ps representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and that it wishes to provide further representations. It has been given 
three extensions of time to do so and said that it was liaising with Mr P on this matter but no 
substantive response to our investigators recommendations has been received so Ive been 
asked to issue a decision on this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr Ps complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to his claim under 
section 140A for a refund of the money that hes paid for the two holiday club 
memberships (and other compensation) and his complaint form says that the 
timeshare company didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ps financial position 
and ability to repay the loan, applied considerable pressure to procure his agreement 
to the loan, breached EU Law and that an undeclared commission was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company;
although the complaint form refers to the timeshare company it also refers to both 
purchases and I consider it be more likely than not that the intention is that Mr Ps 
complaint is that there were unfair relationships between Mr P and Barclays Partner 
Finance relating to the June 2010 purchase and also the May 2011 purchase - so my 
decision is made on that basis;
the claim that was made to Barclays Partner Finance by Mr Ps representative didnt 
include a complaint about undeclared commission so Im unable to consider that as 
part of this complaint  if Mr P wants to complain about undeclared commissions he 
should first make a complaint about them to Barclays Partner Finance and then, if 
hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a complaint to this 
service;
although Im unable to make a finding on that issue, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
10% and I consider it to be unlikely that: Barclays Partner Finance would have 
breached any duty if it made any such payments; that it would have been under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission that was paid; or that the level 
of commission that was paid was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr P risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationships between Mr P 
and Barclays Partner Finance were unfair in these circumstances and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the relationships were unfair;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt consider Mr Ps claim about the June 2010 purchase 
under section 140A because it said that the claim was time-barred  but the courts 
have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation purposes runs 
from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still running at the time 
the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under section 140A is six 
years;
Mr Ps claim to Barclays Partner Finance was made in November 2016 and the loan 
that it made to him in June 2010 hadnt been repaid by November 2010 so I consider 
that it should have considered his claim about that loan under section 140A;Barclays Partner Finance said that the reference number quoted by Mr Ps 
representative in its claim letter in November 2016 for the May 2011 purchase related 
to another customer so it didnt consider Mr Ps complaint about that purchase  but 
Mr P has provided evidence to show that it had made a loan to him in May 2011 so I 
consider that it should also have considered his claim about that loan under section 
140A;
Mr Ps representative has provided some information about the sale of the holiday 
club memberships to Mr P and his wife but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that they were unduly pressurised into buying the memberships or 
entering into the fixed sum loan agreements, or that the timeshare companies used 
unacceptable commercial practices against them  Mr P didnt complain to Barclays 
Partner Finance about the way that the memberships had been sold to them until 
November 2016 (which was more than six years after the June 2010 purchase) and 
he and his wife bought another membership about a year later and I dont consider it 
to be likely that they would have done so if they felt that theyd been unfairly 
pressurised into buying the membership in June 2010;
Mr P and his wife signed the membership agreement in June 2010 but they havent 
been able to provide a copy of the agreement for the May 2011 purchase - and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they tried to withdraw from those agreements or that 
they complained to either of the timeshare companies or to Barclays Partner Finance 
about their issues with the agreements until November 2016;
the evidence shows that Mr P made regular repayments under both loan agreements 
and the loans were both settled in full  Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P 
contacted Barclays Partner Finance about any financial difficulties or that he 
complained about the affordable checks until November 2016, which was more than 
six years after the first loan was made to him, and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the loans werent affordable for Mr P at the time that 
they were made to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare 
companies have failed to comply with any legal requirements in these circumstances 
or that theres been a breach of contract by either of them for which Barclays Partner 
Finance would be liable;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt properly consider Mr Ps claims under section 140A 
so I cant say that its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but I consider 
that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would 
have concluded that the loans were affordable for Mr P, that he hadnt been unfairly 
pressurised into entering into the agreements and that its relationships with him 
werent unfair; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
memberships and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr P any of the 
payments that hes made under the loan agreements, to pay him any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
