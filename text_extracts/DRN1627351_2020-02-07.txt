K821x#15complaint
Miss A says Elevate Credit International  Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss A says the loans were unaffordable  and she got into further  debt because  of 
them. 
background
This complaint is about 19 payday  loans  Sunny  provided to Miss A between January 2017  
and October 2018.  Miss As borrowing history  is attached as an appendix.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss As complaint. He thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. He recommended Sunny refund all interest and charges 
incurred from loans  six to 19 and all entries  about  the loans should  be removed from 
Miss As credit file.
Sunny disagreed but in response to the adjudicator it offered to uphold  Miss As complaint 
from loan 11 onwards, which it later amended to loan ten. Miss A didnt accept the offer. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN16273512I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint.
Miss A didnt disagree with our adjudicators findings  about loans one to five. Because  of this 
I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making  a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss A had with 
Sunny. So, they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans she 
took. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Miss As borrowing with Sunny to see it there was a point 
at which  Sunny should reasonably have  seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  I think  that this point was reached  by loan six. Sunny should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans  to Miss A. I say this because:
At this point, Sunny ought to have realised Miss A wasnt  managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. She was borrowing soon after repaying or taking overlapping 
loans which were  increasing her monthly payments. So Sunny should have realised 
that it was more likely that Miss A wasnt borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but more  to meet an ongoing  need.  
By loan six, there wasnt  any significant reduction in Miss As borrowing  the 
amounts borrowed  ranged  between £100 and £250  so Sunny ought to have  
realised it was more likely  than not Miss A was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loans were leaving in her finances and that Miss As 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 19 was 
taken out 22 months after Miss As first. Miss A had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss A lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss As indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN16273513The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Miss A borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss As ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint from loan six onwards and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny has told us there are outstanding balances on loans  17  19. The outstanding 
balances due on Miss As loans may have been transferred to a third party. If this is the 
case, Sunny  should buy the loans  back if it can. If Sunny cant  buy the loans back, then it 
needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss A towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Miss A which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss A originally made  the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Miss A as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results  in Miss A having  made overpayments then you should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would  have  arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Miss A. However, if there is still an outstanding balance  
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss A. 
E) the number  of loans taken from loans  six onwards means  any information recorded  about  
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loan six onwards should  be removed from 
Miss As credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss As complaint.  
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 March  2020.
