Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him
background
This complaint is about 7 payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr G between  4 September  
2017 and 29 March 2018. There were  also a number of top-ups to these loans.  For ease of 
reference Ive attached  a table of his borrowing  to this decision. The top-ups are shown as 
1a, 2a, 2b etc.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint and thought  the borrowing from the third top-up on 
his second loan (loan 2C in the table)  onwards shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid 
disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN29522822Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
QuickQuid has explained that it believes that it did carry out proportionate checks  after 2015. 
But this Service has already responded to QuickQuid about  our thoughts  on the subject of 
proportionate checks after 2015  both directly  and in different decisions. So I do not intend to 
address this directly  although I did consider it alongside everything else in making my 
decision.
Our adjudicator has said that they thought had QuickQuid carried  out proportionate checks  
from loan 2C onward  then it would have realised that further  lending  to Mr G would not have 
been sustainable for Mr G due to the level of gambling that was shown on Mr Gs bank 
statements. So the adjudicator thought that QuickQuid shouldve  realised  at this point that it 
should not provide any further  borrowing to Mr G.
Our adjudicator explained that QuickQuid  should  have been  comprehensive  in its checks  
from this point onwards  and verified what Mr G was saying about  his income and 
expenditure. But I think that it is debatable  whether QuickQuid should have verified 
everything at this point.
That said though given the number  of times  Mr G had asked for further advances on his 
second loan I think that QuickQuid should  have done more than gather information about  his 
regular income and expenditure when he asked for this third top-up. At the least  it ought to 
have checked  whether  or not Mr G had anything else that would impact  on his payments  for 
this loan such as other  payday loans. Had it done so, its likely that QuickQuid wouldve 
learnt that Mr G was borrowing from several lenders  at the same  time has he was borrowing 
from QuickQuid and therefore that additional  short term lending  was likely to be unaffordable 
for him.
In these circumstances, I think QuickQuid ought to have realised it was unlikely Mr G 
wouldve been able to sustainably repay this loan. 
For the loans  taken out after this point I think the same applies that had proportionate checks  
been carried out QuickQuid would have  seen that Mr G was borrowing from multiple lenders 
at the same  time and that the lending was unaffordable to him. And when Mr G applied for 
loan 4 top up two (listed  as 4b on the below table),  I dont think it was fair for QuickQuid to 
continue to rely on the information Mr G was providing and ought to have verified this. And, 
at this point, I think its likely  his spending  on gambling would have come to light.   
I note QuickQuid has mentioned that Mr Gs repayment history  would suggest that he could 
afford these  loans. But QuickQuid should be aware  that the fact Mr G was repaying the 
loans as per the agreement or even repaying them early doesnt mean he did so sustainably  
Ref: DRN29522823or out of his savings/income.  I think  that had proportionate checks been made QuickQuid 
should reasonably have  been aware that this lending was not sustainable and the reason 
that the majority of these  loans  were  repaid was due to Mr Gs other borrowing rather  than 
because these loans  were actually affordable to him. 
There is one exception  to this because when Mr G took out loan 3 it was for a considerably 
smaller amount of £100 and therefore there may be an argument that QuickQuid did carry 
out sufficient checks  to establish whether Mr G could afford this loan. Even had further 
checks been carried out I think that loan 3 would still have seemed affordable and I dont 
think it was unreasonable for this initial loan to have been granted  to Mr G. However, when 
Mr G came back the next day to ask for three times the amount, as with loan 2C, I think  
QuickQuid ought  to have enquired further  into Mr Gs circumstances. And I think its likely it 
wouldve seen that further credit  wasnt  affordable for him because  of his other outstanding 
short term loans.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loan 2C (agreed on the 5 November 
2017) and from loan 3A (agreed  on the 26 November 2017) to loan 6 inclusive.
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 2C onwards from Mr Gs credit file. 
It is unclear as to whether loan 7 has been repaid or if there is still a balance  
outstanding. If there is no balance  outstanding  then refund all interest and charges 
that Mr G paid for loan 7 and pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  
interest and charges from the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of 
settlement. 
If there is a balance outstanding remove all interest and charges that form part of the 
outstanding balance. QuickQuid should  then re-work the account  as if all payments 
made by Mr G went towards the principal sum. But importantly, QuickQuid needs to 
make sure that Mr G doesnt  repay more than the principal amount he borrowed.   
If, after the account rework Mr G has already paid enough to fully repay the principal 
sum then any overpayment should  be refunded to him with 8% simple interest from 
the date of the overpayment to the date of settlement
If however after the above rework, Mr G still has an outstanding principal balance 
due, then QuickQuid  can use the refund from loans 2C  6 to offset this amount. If 
this would still leave  an outstanding balance then Id remind  QuickQuid of its 
obligation to treat him positively and sympathetically. This may mean agreeing an 
affordable repayment  plan with him.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN29522824For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid  should pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 June  2019.
