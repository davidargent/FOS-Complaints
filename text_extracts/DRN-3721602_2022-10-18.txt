The complaint
Mr H complains that IG04 Partners Limited mishandled his motor insurance policy.
Where I refer to IG04, I refer to the above-named company and I include engineers and 
others insofar as I hold IG04 responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
Mr H had a vehicle that he needed to insure. On 3 August 2021, he went online and bought
a policy for the year from 5 August 2021. The policy was branded with the name of
WiseDriving, a trading name of IGO4. The motor insurance premium was about £345.00 for
a year (so a little less than £1.00 a day).
Mr H also bought the optional extra or additional product of breakdown cover for £59.99.
IG04 acted as an intermediary between Mr H and the insurers. 
As he wanted to pay by instalments, IG04 also acted as intermediary between Mr H and a 
finance company. Mr H made an initial payment of £111.13. Mr H agreed to pay the balance 
(including interest) by instalments to the finance company.
As the motor policy was a telematics or black box policy, it was a requirement that the box
had to be installed within 14 days of 5 August 2021. On 4 August 2021, Mr H made an
appointment for installation on 12 August 2021.
The installation didnt happen on that date. IG04 charged a missed appointment fee of
£45.00.
With effect form 26 August 2021, IG04 cancelled the policy. It charged Mr H as follows:
insurance cover £ 19.90
optional extras £ 59.99
cancellation fee £ 75.00
non-refundable fees £195.00
sub-total £349.89
less paid £111.13
total £238.76
On the same day, Mr H complained to IG04 about the cancellation and the charges.
By a final response dated 11 October 2021, IG04 turned down the complaint. Unhappy with
that, Mr H brought his complaint to us on the same day.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. The investigator
thought that:
A call handler said Mr H would get a text message the day before the appointment.
IG04s text message didnt give a specific time when the appointment was going to 
take place. The appointment was between 08:00 and 12:00.
IG04 and the installer shouldve communicated better.
The installer came and left before 08:00. That didnt treat Mr H fairly. The installer 
shouldve waited at least a few minutes after 08:00 before recording it as a missed 
appointment.
Mr H didnt miss the appointment. The cancellation of the policy wasnt fair. So iG04 
should refund Mr H.
The investigator recommended that IG04 should:
1. cancel all the charges totaling £238.76 in Mr Hs name; and
2. refund the £111.13 he paid at the start of the policy; and
3. pay Mr H compensation of £100.00 for all the stress and inconveniences caused.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr H 
and to IG04 on 24 August 2022. I summarise my findings:
I was minded that IG04 didnt treat Mr H fairly in relation to the missed appointment. 
And it wasnt fair to charge him the missed appointment fee of £45.00.
I found it likely that IG04s figure of £195.00 for non-refundable fees was the total of 
the new business fee of £150.00 and the missed appointment fee of £45.00. So IG04 
should deduct the £45.00 from the £195.00 and so from the total of £238.76.
However, I was minded to find that Mr H didnt take the opportunity to get things back 
on track by calling the number in the 7-day cancellation notice. IG04 or the insurer 
cancelled the policy because Mr H hadnt contacted IG04 in response to the 7-day 
notice. So I was minded to find that the cancellation was in line with the policy terms 
and the WiseDriving terms and not unfair.
Subject to any further information from Mr H or from IG04, my provisional decision was that I 
upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct IG04 Partners Limited not to charge Mr H 
the missed appointment fee of £45.00.
IG04 hasnt responded to the provisional decision
Mr H disagreed with the provisional decision in part. He says, in summary, that:
14 days was a tight time. The appointment was well into the 14 days.
IG04s installer turned up too early. The installation wouldve taken about an hour. The installer did not even wait 5 minutes. He said he might come back but he never 
did. The installers unreasonable action shouldnt make Mr H responsible for the 
cancellation cost.
He called the installation company within 7 days asking for an appointment. The 
company didnt have enough appointments available. The first available appointment 
would be beyond the 14 days. So the company refused to give him any appointment 
unless IG04 authorised it.
It was difficult to contact IG04. By the time he was able to make contact the insurer, 
they had already cancelled the policy.
He had no intention to cancel. They cancelled the policy.
The breakdown cover shouldve had a 28- day cooling -off period.
They referred his case to a debt collector number of times and every time he has had 
to make calls and emails to stop that. They do not know if he owes anything at all. 
This has caused significant time lost and stress.
Since he never had any telemetric device installed, he was not technically receiving 
any service or cover by them. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy terms included the following:
YOUR WISEDRIVING DEVICE
It is a condition of this policy that You have a fully operational WiseDriving Device in
Use in Your Car and that it remains in Use at all times.
The WiseDriving Device is owned by iGO4 and licensed to You for the purpose of
this Contract. iGO4, not the Insurer, is responsible for the installation, operation and
removal, if requested, of the professionally fitted WiseDriving Black Box.

A WiseDriving Device must be in Use within 14 days of the purchase date of the
policy and within 14 days of the date You notify Us of any change to the vehicle
under the policy. If a WiseDriving Device is not in Use during this period, We may
cancel the policy in accordance with Part 17 General Conditions.
In the case of a professionally fitted WiseDriving Black Box, if You do not attend Your
installation appointment, or You cancel the appointment with less than 24 hours
notice, iGO4 may charge a Missed Appointment fee as specified in the WiseDriving
Terms and Conditions. 
The policy terms Part 17 general conditions included the following:
CANCELLATION BY US
General Terms
We or iGO4 may cancel Your policy at any time if there are valid grounds for doing
so. Except in the event of fraud or other exceptional circumstances, We will provideYou 7 days notice of cancellation in writing by e-mail or letter. Reasons for

PROFESSIONALLY FITTED WISEDRIVING BLACK BOX

You to install the WiseDriving Black Box within 14 days of the policy purchase date;

A proportionate refund of any premium paid, less agreed charges detailed in the
WiseDriving Terms and Conditions will be allowed providing that there has not been
a claim made against the policy in the current Period of Insurance.
The WiseDriving Terms and Conditions included fees as follows:
New business £150.00
Missed appointment £  45.00
Cancellation £  75.00
The WiseDriving Terms and Conditions also included the following:
There will be no refund for any additional product that you choose alongside your
policy after 14 days from the start date of your policy.
The welcome letter included the following:
If you miss your appointment, you will be charged a fee of £45, and your policy could
be cancelled
Im satisfied that when Mr H bought the policy, IG04 made it clear to him that he was
incurring responsibility for a non-refundable fee of £150.00 for setting up the black box
policy, and he would incur further fees of £45.00 in the event of a missed installation
appointment and of £75.00 in the event of policy cancellation.
From the policy documents, I see that Mr H had said his car was usually kept on his
driveway overnight.
Ive listened to the call recording from 4 August 2021. I note that the installation company
confirmed the registration of Mr Hs car. The company told Mr H its earliest available
appointment was on 12 August 2021. Mr H said he was travelling that day. He agreed to the
appointment that day at his home address. But Mr H expressed interest in an earlier day if
other customers cancelled appointments.
The company said that, the day before the appointment, it would send a text to say whether
the appointment was morning (08:00 to12:00), middle of the day or afternoon. Mr H gave two
mobile phone numbers. The company didnt say it would ring Mr H (unless other customers
cancelled appointments).
In his complaint form, Mr H said the following:
I was also told that the morning appointment will be from 9am t0 13 pm or afternoon
appointment will be from 13 to 17.
That is not correct. The company had told Mr H that a morning appointment might be as
early as 08:00, rather than from 09:00.
His complaint form also said the following:I was advised that I will received a call one day before installation to re-confirm time
and date
That is not correct. The company had said it would send a text. And Mr H later sent us the
installation companys text message dated 11 August, by which it said the installation was
estimated for the morning of 12/08/2021.
So Mr H shouldve been expecting the engineer any time between 08:00 and 12:00.
I find that at around 07:50 on 12 August, the engineer rang both mobile numbers Mr H had
given but no-one answered. As he sat in his vehicle, the engineer took a photograph of the
screen of his telephone showing those calls.
From a photograph of the front door of Mr Hs home, timed at 07:52, I find that the engineer
was there at that time. As he had an appointment, I find it more likely than not that he rang or
knocked at the door. I also find it likely that he wouldve noticed whether Mr Hs car was on
the driveway.
Mr H has told us that he noticed a missed call at about 07:55 and rang the engineer back
within 10 to 15 minutes. He hasnt provided any evidence from his phone or phone bill.
I find that  having told him the appointment would be from 08:00 - IG04 was responsible 
that the engineer didnt wait until after 08:00 before deciding it was a missed appointment.
Mr H has told us that he travelled on a long-haul flight later that day. He hasnt provided any
evidence such as a booking confirmation.
From its email of 13 August 2021, I see that IG04 told Mr H he had missed the appointment
and it had charged a missed appointment fee of £45.00. It asked Mr H to ring the installation
company  and it gave a telephone number and opening hours each day of the week.
From its records, I find that Mr H rang the installation company on the morning of 16 August
2021, but it couldnt give him another appointment because its first available appointment
was in late August - after the 14 days wouldve expired. So it suggested he rang IG04.
Ive seen a 7-day notice of cancellation dated 18 August 2021 from IG04 to Mr H. I accept
that IG04 sent it by email and by post that day. It started as follows:
If you have not had your Black Box installed and you do not have an appointment
before 25 August 2021 to get your Black Box installed your policy will be cancelled
on 25 August 2021.
If you have already contacted our Installation Team and your Black Box is installed
before 25 August 2021, your policy won't be cancelled and you do not need to take
any action.
If you do not want your policy to be cancelled and you do not have an appointment to
have your Black Box installed please call us and we will do our best to help you.
What happens if I don't call?
If we don't hear from you by 25 August 2021, we'll unfortunately have to cancel your
policy.
The letter gave a telephone number and opening hours each day of the week. Mr H had
known since 16 August that he couldnt get an installation appointment before the 14 days
would expire. IG04 was offering to do its best to help him.I find it likely that IG04 would want the policy to continue. I find it likely that - if Mr H had
explained the circumstances of the missed appointment and the waiting time for a new
appointment - IG04 wouldve helped Mr H by authorising an installation outside the 14 days.
Theres not enough evidence that Mr H rang IG04 between 16 and 25 August 2021.
Ive seen a letter dated 26 August 2021. I accept that IG04 sent it by email and by post that
day. IG04 confirmed to Mr H that it had cancelled the policy with effect from that date. It said
he owed the balance of £238.76.
I think that Mr H sent an email to IG04 on 26 August 2021. IG04 acknowledged that email in
a letter dated 27 August 2021. Neither Mr H nor IG04 has sent us a copy of that email.
Ive been satisfied that IG04 had made it clear to Mr H when he bought the policy that he
had incurred a new business fee of £150.00. I find that this was in line with IG04s terms and 
not unfair, even after the cancellation.
I consider that IG04 didnt treat Mr H fairly in relation to the missed appointment. And I
consider that it follows that it wasnt fair to charge him the missed appointment fee of £45.00.
I find it likely that IG04s figure of £195.00 for non-refundable fees is the total of the new
business fee of £150.00 and the missed appointment fee of £45.00. So IG04 should deduct
the £45.00 from the £195.00 and so from the total of £238.76.
However, I find that Mr H didnt take the opportunity to get things back on track by calling the 
number in the 7-day cancellation notice. IG04 or the insurer cancelled the policy because he 
hadnt contacted IG04 in response to the 7-day notice. So I find that the cancellation was in 
line with the policy terms and the WiseDriving terms and not unfair.
And I find that the cancellation fee of £75.00 was in line with the WiseDriving terms and not 
unfair in relation to the administrative cost of dealing with the cancellation.
The insurer had provided insurance cover for about three weeks (and without a black box to
monitor how the vehicle was being driven). So  unlike the investigator - I dont find it unfair
for IG04 to pass on a charge of £19.90 (which is just under £1.00 per day).
Mr H only had about three weeks breakdown cover. But that was an additional product and I
keep in mind that the WiseDriving terms said that there would be no refund for additional
products after 14 days. And I find that the charge of £59.99 was in line with those terms and 
not unfair. There was no 28-day cooling-off period.
As there was a balance due from Mr H, I dont find that IG04 treated him unfairly by 
instructing a debt collection agent to contact him.
I dont doubt that Mr H suffered upset and inconvenience. But  as he didnt respond to the
7-day notice  I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct IG04 to pay compensation for 
distress and inconvenience.
Putting things right
Overall, I find it fair and reasonable to direct that the only step that IG04 should take in 
response to this complaint is not to charge the missed appointment fee of £45.00.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct IG04 Partners Limited not to charge Mr H the missed appointment fee of £45.00.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
