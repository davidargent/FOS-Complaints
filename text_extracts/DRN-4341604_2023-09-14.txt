DRN-4341604
The complaint
Mr H complains that he has been misled by Aviva Insurance Limited about its digital GP 
service under his private medical insurance policy. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigators conclusions, and for these reasons:
I can appreciate it would have been frustrating for Mr H when he had to wait in order 
to access the digital GP service. However, this is a discretionary benefit offered by 
Aviva to its members, and doesnt form part of the insurance contract. 
Aviva sent Mr Hs comments to the company that provides the GP service for them to 
look into and provide a response to Mr H. Im satisfied that was reasonable. 
Avivas brochure says that the digital GP can give round the clock access to a GP. 
Whilst I understand the service is available 24 hours a day, Aviva doesnt guarantee 
an appointment within a particular timeframe. I dont think Aviva has misled Mr H 
about this.
Although Mr H wants Aviva to return his premiums paid since taking out the policy, I 
dont require it to do so. The premium was paid in return for the risk taken by Aviva to 
pay any valid claims under the policy. I therefore see no reason to require Aviva to 
refund Mr Hs premiums. As Ive said, the digital GP service was a discretionary 
benefit offered by Aviva, which means it was under no obligation under the policy 
terms to provide this service.
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
