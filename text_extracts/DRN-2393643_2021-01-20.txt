The complaint
Mrs S complains that Clydesdale Bank Plc trading as Virgin Money unfairly charged late fees 
and withdrew her promotional rate despite making credit card payments on time. 
What happened
On 24 December 2019 Virgin Money issued a credit card statement that said a minimum 
payment of £79.12 was due by 13 January 2020. Mrs S paid £100 on 9 January 2020. 
Virgin Money says Mrs S made another payment for £100 that was received on 23 January 
2020, the day before it issued a new statement. Mrs S says the payment was made on 24 
January 2020 so should have been applied to the statement period beginning that day. 
On 24 January 2020 Virgin Money sent Mrs S a statement that said she had to make a 
minimum payment of £78.02 by 13 February 2020. The statement showed Mrs S had paid 
£100 on 23 January 2020. No further payments were made beyond the one Virgin Money 
says was received on 23 January 2020 and Mrs S says was made on 24 January 2020. 
On 24 February 2020 Virgin Money issued a statement that said Mrs S needed to make an 
immediate payment of £78.02 to clear arrears and then a minimum payment of £134.66 by 
15 March 2020. Mrs S made a payment of £150 on 28 February 2020. 
On 24 March 2020 Virgin Money sent a statement that said Mrs S needed to pay £62.68 
immediately to clear arrears and make a minimum payment of £135.39 by 14 April 2020. Mrs 
S made a payment of £200 on 8 April 2020. 
Mrs S complained to Virgin Money about the fees she incurred as a result of the way her 
payments had been allocated. Mrs S has told us that the reminders she receives to make 
payments dont give the relevant due dates. Mrs S has also told us she didnt receive text 
reminders and that call handlers she spoke with failed to give her a full picture of the arrears. 
Virgin Money responded to Mrs S complaint on 16 April 2020 but didnt agree any errors 
had been made or that the charges were incorrectly applied. 
Mrs S referred her complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator thought Virgin Money had dealt with Mrs S complaint fairly and didnt ask it to 
do anything else. The investigator said no payment had been made to cover the statement 
issued on 24 January 2020. 
Mrs S didnt agree and pointed to a transaction print she supplied that showed the payment 
debited her bank account on 24 January 2020, not 23 January 2020 as Virgin Money claims. 
Mrs S asked to appeal so her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs S has raised concerns about the information she was given by Virgin Money setting out 
how much she needed to pay and when. Mrs S says the reminders she receives dont 
indicate what payments are due. I agree thats the case, but the reminders asked Mrs S to 
check the monthly statement. And the monthly statements say how much a card holder has 
to pay and the date they have to pay by. Im sorry to disappoint Mrs S but I think the 
information Virgin Money provides is clear. 
Mrs S has told us that she didnt receive all the text reminders so wasnt aware of an issue. 
Virgin Money has sent us systems information to show it sent texts to Mrs S as claimed. I 
havent found anything to show Virgin Money made an error when sending text messages. 
The starting point for Mrs S complaint is the second payment made in January 2020. Mrs S 
says that payment she made should count towards the following months statement period. 
Mrs S says her payment was made on 24 January 2020, not 23 January 2020 as Virgin 
Money claims. I recently asked both Mrs S and Virgin Money to provide further information to 
show when this payment was made. 
I asked Virgin Money to provide additional evidence from its payment systems. Virgin Money 
has sent systems evidence that says the payment was made at 19:50 on 22 January 2020 
and applied to Mrs S credit card balance on 23 January 2020. The payment information 
contains authorisation data that shows how the payment was made as well as the time and 
date. 
Virgin Money has also pointed to contact notes recording their conversations with Mrs S. On 
21 February 2020 Virgin Money recorded that Mrs S told it she made a payment on 
22 January 2020 but it wasnt debited from her account until 24 January 2020. That appears 
to back up the payment systems information Virgin Money has provided. 
I also asked Mrs S to send some further information as its clear the dates differ. Mrs S has 
provided a screen shot of her transaction history taken from Lloyds online banking system. It 
says a payment of £100 was made on 24 January 2020. It also says Mrs S made another 
payment for £150 on 2 March 2020. 
I can see that the screen print shows the payment left Mrs S current account on 24 January 
2020. But I think the systems information provided by Virgin Money is compelling. 
Specifically, the payment systems evidence contains information that timed, dated and 
confirmed the payment method. I note Mrs S also appears to have told Virgin Money her 
payment was made on 22 January 2020 when she spoke with it. 
In addition, the screen print Mrs S sent us says she made another payment to Virgin Money, 
on 2 March 2020, but the systems evidence from Virgin Money show that payment was 
made on 28 February 2020, at 12:39. I think the difference between the dates reflects the 
time it takes payments to be debited.
I also note that the statement Virgin Money sent Mrs S on 24 January 2020 confirmed it had 
received a payment on 23 January 2020. The statement advised that Mrs S had to make a 
minimum payment of £78.02 by 13 February 2020. As Ive said above, I think the information 
Virgin Money sent Mrs S, including the statements, were clear in setting out what payments 
were required. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs S but the information provided shows the payment was made on 
22 January 2020 and applied to the credit card balance the following day. As that payment was correctly applied to the statement period ending 23 January 2020, Mrs S had to make 
another payment to cover the statement period beginning 24 January 2020, in line with the 
information Virgin Money sent. 
Mrs S didnt make a payment to cover the period 24 January 2020 so I think Virgin Moneys 
decision to apply charges was reasonable. I havent found that Virgin Money has made a 
mistake in respect of how payments have been applied to her credit card balance. 
Virgin Money has told us that it has recorded arrears on Mrs S credit file because payments 
werent made in full and on time. Virgin Money says it is obliged to report factual information 
about accounts and its statements show the level of arrears. I understand Mrs S feels she 
made her payments on time, but as Ive said above, I havent found that payments were 
made in line with the statement information. As payments werent made in full and on time, 
Virgin Money can report that to the credit reference agencies. 
I understand my decision will come as a disappointment for Mrs S, but I havent found that 
Virgin Money made an error or provided unclear information about to her credit card 
payments. As Im satisfied Virgin Money has dealt with Mrs S complaint fairly, Im not telling 
it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 February 2021.
