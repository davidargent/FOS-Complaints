The complaint
Mr S complains that Clydesdale Bank Plc (Clydesdale) wont refund over £24,000 he spent 
on his credit card as part of an investment scam. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. In brief summary, Mr S fell victim to an investment scam after seeing an advert 
about cryptocurrency investments with the broker Safe Markets (the scammer) in 2017. 
The scammer opened him up a fake trading account, where he was encouraged to invest by 
making the following payments from his Clydesdale credit card (not including transaction 
fees):
Date Payee AmountMethod of payment

15/05/2018 BO Trader 4,408.91 Credit card 
16/05/2018 Bo Trader 2,195.44 Credit card

Mr S also received the following credits into his account from the scammer:
Date Credit received from Amount
12/06/2018 BO Trader £2,705.63
12/06/2018 Bo Trader £1,805.96
He realised he had been scammed when he was being asked to make further deposits in 
order to withdraw his money. He reported the fraud to Clydesdale, but it failed to respond, so 
Mr S brought his complaint to this service.
Our service made several requests to Clydesdale for information and evidence, but again, it 
failed to respond, other than to say it would be asking its disputes team to review the case. 
However, no response was received. 
As a result, our investigator upheld the complaint in part. She thought that Clydesdale ought 
to have intervened from the third payment Mr S made on 16 May 2018 and considered that it 
could have prevented any further loss if it had done so. However, the investigator also 
thought Mr S should share joint liability for his loss as a result of his own contributory 
negligence.
Mr S didnt dispute joint liability for the loss but thought that Clydesdale should have 
intervened from the very first payment as he hadnt used his credit card for several months 
prior to making the first scam transaction. Given Mr S didnt agree, and as Clydesdale failed 
to respond to the investigators view, the matter has been escalated to me to issue a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator and have decided 
to uphold it in part for the reasons set out below:
It isnt in dispute that Mr S has fallen victim to a scam here, nor that he authorised the 
disputed payments he made to BO Trader using his Clydesdale credit card (where his 
funds were subsequently transferred on to the scammers). The payments were 
requested using his legitimate security credentials provided by Clydesdale, and the 
starting position is that banks ought to follow the instructions given by their customers in 
order for legitimate payments to be made as instructed.
However, Ive considered whether Clydesdale should have done more to prevent Mr S 
from falling victim to the scam, as there are some situations in which a bank should 
reasonably have had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular transfer. 
For example, if it was particularly out of character. 
Given Clydesdale has not provided any information or evidence to this service about the 
payments, we dont know if any of the payments did in fact flag as unusual or suspicious. 
But having reviewed the transactions, Im satisfied there was enough unusual activity to warrant an intervention by Clydesdale. 
Im not persuaded the first three payments listed in the table above would have appeared 
unusual enough to have flagged on Clydesdales fraud monitoring systems. They were 
not particularly large and, while I appreciate Mr S may not have used his credit card for 
several months, it is not unusual to expect one-off large purchases to be made on a 
credit card from time to time. So, I wont be asking Clydesdale to refund these payments. 
However, on 16 May 2018 Mr S made multiple payments to the same payee in on the 
same day, which Clydesdale should know is typically indicative of someone falling victim 
to a scam. As a result, Im satisfied it should have intervened by the third payment of 
£2,195.44 made on 16 May 2018 to question him about the nature of the payments.
If Clydesdale had asked Mr S what the payments were for and the basic surrounding 
context, I have no reason to doubt that he wouldve fully explained what he was doing. It 
could have asked him how he found the broker, and whether he had checked they were 
regulated or featured on the FCA warning list. An FCA warning had in fact been 
published about Safemarkets in April 2018, so its likely he would have discovered this 
warning, and I dont think he would have gone on to make any further payments from his 
Clydesdale credit card as a result. So, but for Clydesdales failure to act on clear triggers 
of potential fraud or financial harm, Mr S probably wouldnt have not lost any further 
money. Therefore, I think it is fair and reasonable for Clydesdale to refund the money 
lost from the point it should have intervened.
Given Mr S has not disputed joint liability as a result of his own contributory negligence, I 
dont intend to explore this point any further, other than to say that I agree it would be fair 
and reasonable for him to share liability for his lack of due diligence and failing to 
question unrealistic promises made by the broker, such as risk free trading. 
Ive also considered whether Mr S would have any recourse for recovering his money by 
making a Section 75 claim under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. However, in this 
instance, he did not pay the scammer directly, so there would be no valid 
debtor/creditor/supplier agreement for such a claim to succeed. There wouldve also 
been no prospect of a chargeback claim being made for these transactions either given 
the timeframe to dispute the payments had passed by the time Mr S reported the 
payments. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Clydesdale Bank Plc to:
Refund 50% of the payments Mr S made to the scammer from the third payment 
made on 16 May 2018 onwards, less any credits received into the account;
Refund 50% of the associated transactions fees;
Rework the credit card account as if 50% of the payments had not been made;
If this results in a credit balance, pay 8% simple interest per year on any payment 
that would have resulted in a credit balance from the date of each payment to the 
date of settlement;
Amend Mr Ss credit file to reflect the direction set out in this decision. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
