K820x#14complaint
Mrs F says HSBC  UK Bank Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold her a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy.  
background and summary to complaint
Mrs F bought the policy in 2000 at the same time as taking out a loan. Due to the time that 
has passed, its not clear  how Mrs F applied  for her loan and PPI policy  although its likely 
she did this in branch.  
The policys  one-off upfront  premium of £1101.27 was paid in advance by being  added to the 
loan (a single premium)  where it attracted interest  over the term of the loan. The loan was 
repayable over a 36-month term and the policy term matched that of the loan.  Its not known 
what the monthly loan repayment was, but the PPI cost an additional £36.13 a month.
 
The policy provided  cover  for Mrs F for accident,  sickness, unemployment and life  subject 
to its exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay Mrs Fs monthly  loan repayment for up to 
the remaining  term in the event of a successful disability claim and for up to 12 months  at a 
time in the event  of unemployment.  
Its not clear what Mrs Fs circumstances were  at the time of sale.  Mrs F provided this 
service with information about her circumstances in 1990  10 years before the date of sale.  
Despite several requests  through her representative she didnt respond to our enquiries. 
HSBC had also tried to contact her, but she declined to speak to them. 
HSBC records show that Mrs F was working  full time at the time of sale. I have assumed that 
Mrs F was entitled to statutory sick pay and redundancy  pay and that she was in good health  
at the time of the sale.  
HSBC has sent us screenshots to show that the loan account closed in December 2003.
Mrs Fs representative  has made  lengthy  and substantial representations on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs Fs representative  says:
HSBC failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  APP 3, it should be presumed  Mrs F wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs Fs 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means HSBC should  have 
told Mrs F about the poor value;
 
Ref: DRN55971352The common law duty of utmost good faith also means HSBC should  have explained  
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs F and the impact 
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs F disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Fs. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Fs complaint
This sale took place  in 2000 before the sale of general insurance products like this became 
regulated in January 2005.  So, the FSAs  (and FCAs) overarching  Principles for Businesses 
and insurance  conduct  rules  (ICOB and ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint, nor is the 
FCAs Perimeter guidance  (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 2003. That means the unfair relationship  provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin  about  
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of 
complaints about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the Plevin  judgment,  arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The General Insurance Standards Councils General Insurance 
Code for private  customers   the GISC Code. 
This sale was made during a period  of industry  self-regulation by the General Insurance 
Standards Council (GISC).  It published the GISC code, which  set out minimum standards of 
good practice for its members to follow when selling  insurance, including  PPI. 
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) also published a number of codes, which  I consider 
to be indicative of the standards of good industry practice expected from intermediaries, like 
HSBC, selling insurance at this time:
Ref: DRN55971353The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for 
all intermediaries (Including  Employees of Insurance  Companies) other  than 
Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for  Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like HSBC  at the time. So Im satisfied I should  take the ABI code and these 
other publications into account  when  deciding, what is in my opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mrs Fs case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, contract  (including the express  and implied duty on professional advisers to give 
advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost  duty of good 
faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness). 
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so 
HSBC was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  
guidance when  considering Mrs Fs complaint.  
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If HSBC gave advice,  whether  it advised  Mrs F with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether HSBC gave Mrs F sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable 
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
Ref: DRN55971354-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs F, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs F suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs F and 
HSBC, Ive decided  not to uphold Mrs Fs complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mrs F know she had a choice?
HSBC had to make  it clear that the PPI policy was optional. Given  over 20 years have 
passed since the date of sale its unsurprising  that neither party  has been able to provide a 
copy of the agreement. But HSBC  has been able to provide a sample  copy  of the agreement 
it says was in use at the time and I think its likely this was used in Mrs Fs sale.  It makes  it 
clear the PPI is optional  and gives  the consumer a clear  choice  about  taking the policy. Mrs 
F doesnt  suggest  she didnt agree  to take the PPI.
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Mrs F knew the policy was 
optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure. 
did HSBC provide  advice?
Its not clear whether  advice was provided  during the sale, but HSBC has said that it has 
treated Mrs Fs sale as if it was provided. This holds HSBC to a higher standard,  so I think 
that is fair to Mrs F.
This means  HSBC had to advise Mrs F with reasonable care and skill, in particular whether 
the policy was appropriate or suitable given her needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps HSBC took to establish  whether  the policy was a suitable  
recommendation for Mrs F. It seems Mrs F cant remember clearly  what happened  and there 
is no record of what the adviser discussed  in relation to the policy. This is unsurprising  in 
respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser  likely had some limited information  about 
Mrs Fs financial circumstances, but there  is no specific evidence to show  the adviser took 
steps to establish whether Mrs F would have  been caught by the significant  exclusions and 
limitations which might have meant the policy did not fully meet her needs. For example, 
there is nothing to suggest  HSBC considered whether Mrs F had any pre-existing medical  
conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities Im not persuaded HSBC  did all it should have done 
to determine whether  the policy was suitable  for Mrs F given her circumstances. So Im not 
persuaded HSBC  advised  with reasonable care and skill.
While Im not persuaded HSBC did all it should have done to make  sure the policy  was 
suitable for Mrs F, I do think its more likely  than not that the policy was ultimately suitable for 
her. In reaching  that conclusion  Ive taken into consideration:
-Mrs F met the eligibility criteria for the policy.
Ref: DRN55971355-Mrs F had a need for the policy  she would  not have received any sick pay if she 
had been unable to work due to illness, her redundancy benefits are likely to be 
limited and she didnt  have any savings she could fall back on. The policy  would have 
helped Mrs F manage the consequences were she unable to work.
-There is no evidence to suggest the monthly  cost of the policy  appears  was 
unaffordable for Mrs F.
-The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Mrs F. There was 
nothing known about Mrs Fs circumstance which would have made it difficult  for her 
to claim. And she hasnt  told us about any pre-existing medical conditions that could 
affect her ability to claim. There were also no additional restrictions on cover for 
mental health or back problems.
-Although a pro-rata refund  would not have been  paid if Mrs F cancelled the policy 
early and there is nothing  to suggest (at the time) that Mrs F had plans to repay the 
loan early. The purpose of the loan was not debt consolidation or anything  else which 
might suggest a need to repay  the loan early,  or that this was likely to happen.
 
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  HSBC gave Mrs F sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  HSBC  
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not that Mrs F was given a broad description of what  the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect her payments if Mrs F was 
unable to work through accident,  sickness and unemployment.)  I have reached this 
conclusion because I think  its unlikely  Mrs F would have taken out the policy  without any 
sense of what the policy was. And I think Mrs F knew that {the single premium being  added 
to the loan was £1101.27, and the monthly cost was £36.13  (as this information was, in my 
view, sufficiently clear on the loan agreement Mrs F likely signed.)  
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  HSBC gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, sufficient information about  the cost  for 
example the loan agreement does not show the total cost of the policy over the term of the 
loan, including  interest - or about  the exclusions or limitations before Mrs F agreed  to take 
out the policy. 
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied the policy was a suitable recommendation for Mrs F Im not persuaded HSBC  did 
enough to present information about the policy it was recommending in a way that was fair 
and reasonable to Mrs F. Im not persuaded HSBC gave Mrs F all of the information she 
needed about the policy to make an informed decision  about  whether to follow the 
recommendation and take it out.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded there  were  significant  failings in this case.
Ref: DRN55971356In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Fs representative has raised a number 
of general points in regard  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Fs. Ive considered  
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs Fs representative considers to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs F about the limitations  and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Fs representatives views  on this. The duty of utmost good  faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think its unlikely a court would  find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mrs F has suggested. And taking  into account  the law, industry  codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that HSBC ought to have done  either. 
What effect did HSBCs  shortcomings  have on Mrs F? To what extent  did Mrs F suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that HSBC  didnt do all it should  have done when it sold this policy to Mrs F. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs F 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs F 
would have still taken  out the policy, had HSBC done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded HSBC took the steps  it should  have  done  to establish whether the 
policy it recommended  was suitable for Mrs F, I have found  that the policy  was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Mrs F has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if HSBC had explained things properly, 
Mrs F would have acted differently, or whether she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Mrs F says she wouldnt have taken it out and believes I should presume this to be the case 
given the significant failings identified  above.  Ive considered  the representations of both 
sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come  to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mrs F had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when HSBC  advised her that there  was a suitable 
Ref: DRN55971357product she could buy that would protect  her mortgage payments in the event she had been  
unable to work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, she concluded  she 
wanted that product. But she made  that decision based on incomplete  information, meaning 
what she thought  she was getting was not exactly what she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Mrs Fs circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her.
However, Im not persuaded HSBC made  clear  exactly what Mrs F would get back in return 
in the event she made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Mrs Fs expectations about 
what the policy would pay in the event  of a claim (an amount sufficient to meet  her loan 
repayment) were significantly different to what the policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs F thought  she had bought  and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions or symptoms  that Mrs F 
knew about or ought to have known about  before the start date of the policy, or any 
medical condition  or disease for which shed  received treatment, advice or was 
referred for investigation during the 12 months  before the start date which  recurred 
within 12 months of the start date;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs F 
wasnt a permanent employee;
The policy likely did not provide a pro-rata  refund if Mrs F repaid the loan early and 
the policy was cancelled, so it wouldve been  more expensive  for Mrs F to have done  
so.
I do accept there is a possibility the limitations and exclusions  above might well have caused  
Mrs F pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude the policy wasnt  as 
good as she thought and she might have decided not to proceed. The limitations on the 
cover, when  coupled  with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have  dissuaded some  
consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs F from taking out the policy.  
But, the evidence  about Mrs Fs circumstances at the time of sale shows  the policy  wasnt 
fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it provided 
cover that, despite its limitations and exclusions, couldve proved valuable  to her should  the 
insured risks have  become a reality. I also havent  seen any evidence to suggest she 
wouldve been caught by any of the significant exclusions  Mrs F didnt tell us of any pre-
existing medical conditions and she was in permanent  employment. Mrs F also didnt likely 
need, and theres  no evidence  to suggest  she intended, to repay the loan early.  So, I still 
think she had some good reasons to take the policy out
The policy didnt exclude back or mental  health conditions or place  any additional restrictions  
or more  onerous evidential requirements  in the event of a claim on those grounds than 
would have applied  to any other  disability  claim.  And I think  its unlikely Mrs F would have 
expected to make a disability claim on the policy without first providing some  evidence to 
support that claim.
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not Mrs F would still have taken  out the policy. The policy was suitable for her, was 
sufficiently close to what its likely she thought she was getting  and provided benefits that 
would help her manage  the consequences  were  Mrs F made redundant, or unable to work 
Ref: DRN55971358through accident or disability. In the circumstances I consider it more likely than not Mrs F 
would have taken  out the policy  in any event notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Mrs Fs representatives  say the rules about  how to handle PPI complaints (DISP  App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ive thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, Ive found it would be reasonable to conclude there were 
substantial flaws in the sales process. In those circumstances,  DISP  App 3 says it should be 
presumed Mrs F would  not have  bought  the PPI she bought unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the complaint, there  is evidence  to rebut the presumption. 
Im satisfied, applying DISP App 3, its reasonable to conclude the presumption is rebutted in 
the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking  into account Mrs Fs 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs F 
found herself in as result of the sale was the same  position she would have been in had the 
breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mrs F believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs F in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept it is possible that she would not have taken out the policy,  I 
am satisfied  that of the two possibilities, its more  likely than not that she would still have 
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude HSBC should  pay Mrs F compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Fs representative says a court might take if it were 
to find HSBC had been in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. But this doesnt persuade 
me to alter my conclusions about  what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the 
complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the circumstances of this case. For 
the reasons Ive already  set out I dont  think  it would be fair and reasonable to put Mrs F in a 
better position than if everything had happened  as it should have done. 
my decision
Ref: DRN55971359Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2021.
