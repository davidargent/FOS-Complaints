The complaint
Mr G complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) administered a refund 
he received. 
What happened
In November 2019, Mr G used his PayPal Credit account to pay Â£3,167.59 for a holiday. 
Unfortunately, the holiday was cancelled by the provider before it took place. The holiday 
retailer issued a refund for the purchase which it sent to PayPal. PayPal used the refunds to 
reduce what Mr G owed on his PayPal Credit account. 
Mr G asked for the refunds to be paid directly to him so he could book another holiday. 
PayPal didnt agree to that request. It said as the PayPal Credit facility was used to pay for 
the holiday, the refund needed to be applied back to the account, in accordance with its 
terms and conditions.
Our investigator didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly. 
Mr G disagreed, he said he entered an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) in April 2020, 
which included PayPal, so he didnt think it should have offset the refund payments against 
his PayPal Credit balance. In addition, he said PayPal confirmed on the phone and by email 
that his account was restricted, so no refunds should have been processed in or out of his 
account.
The complaint has been passed to me for a final decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G made the payment for the holiday using his PayPal Credit account. I therefore consider 
the terms and conditions of that account to be relevant and key when deciding whether 
PayPal acted fairly. This is because it is these terms and conditions that Mr G agreed to 
when taking out the account. 
As the investigator and PayPal have highlighted, the terms and conditions are clear that any 
refund which is received from a retailer will go back onto the payment method that was used. 
In this case, Mr G used some of his available credit limit on his PayPal Credit account, so 
I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly in applying the refund back onto the Credit account 
and thereby reducing Mr Gs arrears balance. 
The terms and conditions arent the only consideration. Irrespective of what the terms say, 
Ive thought more broadly about what would be fair overall.  
The holiday Mr G purchased was done so using credit from PayPal, not his own money. 
PayPal effectively paid for the holiday on Mr Gs behalf and he was contractually obliged to 
repay PayPal in instalments. Around three months after making the purchase, I can see that 
Mr Gs PayPal credit account was restricted due to his repayment difficulties. Mr G also 
entered into an IVA shortly afterwards. 
Once the refund from the holiday retailer was received, Mr G still had an outstanding 
balance remaining on his PayPal credit account. Given he hadnt yet paid PayPal back for 
the purchase, Im of the view that it was fair and reasonable for PayPal to use the refund to 
pay back what Mr G owed it. As Mr G was never out of pocket for those funds because it 
wasnt his money that was used, I dont think it would be reasonable for him to receive the 
refund. I note Mr G entered into an IVA and our investigator has discussed the refund with 
the IVA practitioner who has confirmed that they have no problem with PayPal keeping the 
refund either as PayPal are one of the creditors listed under Mr Gs IVA. Im therefore 
satisfied PayPal werent unfair or unreasonable in using the refund to offset what Mr G owed 
on his account. 
Mr G says that PayPal told him his account was restricted and that no payments could be 
made in or out of the account. He says on that basis the refund should have gone directly to 
him. Even if PayPal had said this to Mr G, it doesnt mean PayPal ought to be required to 
pay the refund to him directly. In any event, I can see that PayPal did give Mr G the correct 
information in subsequent communication with him and told him the refund would be applied 
to the Credit account. As Ive set out above, contractually PayPal wasnt required to pay the 
refund to him, nor do I consider PayPal to have acted unfairly or unreasonably in using the 
refund to offset what Mr G owed. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
