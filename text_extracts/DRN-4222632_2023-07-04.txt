The complaint
Mr K represents his mother  Mrs K  in this complaint. Originally, he had a power of 
attorney allowing him to do so. Sadly Mrs K died during the time weve been investigating. 
Mr K continues to represent her as the executor of her estate.
Mr K complains about information Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited have provided in 
response to questions hes had about a bond his mother had with them.
What happened
Mrs K and her husband set up their bond in 1999, investing £25,000. The bond gave them 
monthly payments so that each year they received 5% of the amount theyd invested back. 
That seems to have made use of a tax deferred allowance the bond allowed.
The bond appears to have been split around April 2015, such that Mrs K owned one half, 
and her husband owned the other. Mrs Ks husband died in November 2016. In early 2017 
his half of the bond was reassigned to Mrs K, giving her both halves of the bond.
Mr K has been helping his mother manage the bond for some years. In 2020, he asked 
Aviva for details about the total value of withdrawals from the bond. Aviva sent letters in 
August 2020 to respond, but clarified in February 2022 that thered been errors in those.
Aviva have given different figures for the total value of withdrawals up to early August 2020:
In their 6 August 2020 letter it was £21,424.56
In their 11 August 2020 letter it was £21,456.96
In their 15 February 2022 letter it was £21,404.88.
In addition, the 11 August letter explained how the withdrawals were spread over time:
1. £104.16 taken monthly from 1 June 1999 to 28 September 2015 inclusive.
2. Two payments of £52.08, one on 24 December 2015 and the other on 28 January 
2016.
3. £52.08 taken monthly from 28 March 2019 to 29 July 2020 inclusive.
Ive calculated this comes to £21,509.04.
In addition, the 6 August letter explained that £905.04 of the withdrawals came solely from 
the half of the investment that had passed to Mrs K in 2015 (Mrs Ks half). The 11 August 
letter didnt give a similar figure, but did say the payments numbered 2 and 3 above came 
from Mrs Ks half. I calculate these total £989.52. The 15 February letter also said the figure 
should be £989.52.
From 2020 to date, Mr K raised issues with Aviva about the information in these letters. He 
first came to us about the issues around June 2021. Aviva wrote some complaint responses 
in September 2021, but these dont add much to my understanding of the discrepancies. 
They however show Aviva offered to pay Mrs K £200 to compensate her for the delay in 
responding to the enquiries and complaints Mr K had raised.
Separately, Mrs K surrendered the bond in December 2021. That created a chargeable 
event for tax purposes. Aviva issued a certificate, which has raised further issues for Mr K.
I wrote last time how wed received more details from Aviva about the chargeable event 
calculation. It had to consider the withdrawals made over the life of the bond. Aviva delayed 
providing the information twice to allow them to check a possible error. But on 5 May 2023 
they confirmed the bonds gain had been calculated using the following withdrawal details:
1. £104.16 taken monthly from June 1999 to January 2017.
2. £52.08 taken monthly from February 2017 to January 2021.
3. £135.41 taken monthly from February 2021 to December 2021.
Aviva also provided a spreadsheet showing the dates of the various withdrawals. Using that 
spreadsheet, I explained that I could see the withdrawals to 29 July 2020  the last before 
6 August 2020  would have come to £24,321.36.
Aviva also noted a mistake in the chargeable gain calculation made following the bonds 
surrender in December 2021. They said the gain for what had been Mrs Ks half of the policy 
should have been £8,084, not the £8,188 used. They offered to issue a new certificate.
Last time, I wrote how I intended to uphold this complaint. I found the discrepancies above 
showed a difference of £2,916.48 between what Aviva told Mr K in February 2022 had been 
paid to Mrs K, and what Aviva told declared had been withdrawn in the tax calculation. I was 
minded to treat this as a loss for Mrs K, which Aviva would need to compensate her for. 
I also wrote that I intended to attach interest to that payment to reflect that Mrs K  and later 
her estate  had been without the use of the money. I also said that if Aviva werent able to 
calculate this interest payment in a set time, they were to reimburse any cost Mr K could 
show the estate had incurred having the interest calculated. 
I also wrote that I intended to direct Aviva pay £1,000 compensation to Mrs Ks estate to 
acknowledge the emotional impact theyd caused for Mrs K while alive. 
Aviva responded asking for some clarification about the interest calculation I was directing 
them to make. Ill add to what I wrote last time to make this is a little clearer. 
Mr K confirmed hed received my provisional decision and asked for some more time to 
respond. Weve given him just over seven weeks now, but I cant see any further 
representations. Im satisfied I have enough information to make a final decision at this point 
though, so Ive decided to proceed. What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My understanding of this case hasnt changed since last time. And it follows that my decision 
remains the same too. Ill repeat the key details here to confirm my final decision.
My summary above shows the discrepancies in what Aviva have said over the years about 
the total withdrawals for this bond. I find the discrepancies unreasonable. Aviva should have 
a record for this bond that shows exactly what has been withdrawn over the years. Their 
answer shouldnt change every time they give it.
I also consider the time taken by Aviva to respond to Mr Ks contact  and to our 
investigation  was unreasonable. Aviva should have been able to use their records to 
provide the relevant details about this bond without this sort of delay.
Putting things right
The scale of the discrepancies here  coupled with the absence of a satisfactory record from 
Aviva  makes directing a remedy difficult for this case.
I consider it reasonable to use the value from Avivas last letter to Mr K about the 
withdrawals  the one from 15 February 2022 which said they totalled £21,404.88  as the 
amount Mrs K received from the bond, up to August 2020. Aviva had two years to confirm 
this figure was correct, and havent shown us anything since then that convinces me any 
other figure is more accurate.
I also consider it reasonable to use the value from Avivas tax calculation as the amount 
thats been withdrawn from the bond. Aviva took extra time to make sure what they sent us 
was correct, and were happy to use it in in something as important as the bonds tax 
calculation. So Im going to treat it as accurate. Up to August 2020, this totalled £24,321.36.
The difference between these two figures is then the difference between what Aviva have 
told us was withdrawn from the bond and what theyve told Mr K  and us  was received by 
Mrs K. That amount  which I calculate comes to £2,916.48  is a loss for Mrs K. She should 
have received everything withdrawn from the bond, either directly or through her husband 
and his estate.
To put that right, I direct Aviva to pay that amount to Mr K, as executor for Mrs Ks estate. 
I also find simple interest should be paid on this amount at 8%, to reflect that Mrs K was 
without the use of this money. But to do this, Aviva will need to track how the discrepancy 
between their February 2022 and May 2023 records has grown over the years. 
To help with this, I can set out the discrepancy between the description given on the 
withdrawals in Avivas 11 August 2020 letter  the first numbered list above  and the 
description given with their tax calculation in May 2023  the second numbered list above. 
Ive done this in the table below.

The interest calculation needs to reflect this increasing difference. But it also needs to 
account for another £52.08 to reach the £2,916.48 difference Ive seen between Avivas 
February 2022 and May 2023 figures. 
Given the confusing information Aviva have provided over this investigation, Im going to 
direct the missing £52.08 be treated as if it was absent from 28 September 2015. That 
seems like the earliest possible point it could have arisen. 
That means the interest calculation should apply 8% interest on this first shortfall for almost 
eight years, to reflect how long Mrs Ks not had the use of it. At the other end of the scale, 
the last £52.08  absent since February 2019  will attract just over four years of simple 
interest in the calculation Im directing. 
If Aviva cant work this interest calculation out within two-weeks of being told this decision is 
accepted, Mr K can pay for an accountant to do the calculation and have Aviva reimburse 
the cost on top of the compensation for this case. Aviva may ask Mr K for an itemised receipt 
before making any reimbursement.
Im not going to direct Aviva provide a definitive account of the transactions made on this 
bond over its lifetime. I dont believe theyre able to. Theyve had years to do so already, 
including numerous requests from our investigation for this sort of information. If they had 
this to provide, they should have done so by now. The fact they havent tells me they dont 
have such a record.
That further supports the financial loss compensation Ive directed above. Without a 
definitive record Mr K will be left with a feeling Mrs K suffered a loss of some kind. But I 
consider it unlikely any loss would be more than the amount Im directing. So the 
compensation will put right the absence of a reliable record, in that sense.I can also direct compensation for any inconvenience, distress or suffering Aviva caused for 
Mrs K. But our scheme doesnt extend to compensating her representative  Mr K  directly. 
I note though that Mrs K was aware of Mr Ks efforts, and would no doubt have been 
concerned to hear that Avivas records and responses were so poor for such a long period.
Ive thought about the £200 Aviva already offered to recognise this impact, but I find it 
doesnt go far enough. This matter went on for years without Aviva doing enough to provide 
a clear and satisfying account of the bond. The prolonged worry and upset that caused is 
better reflected with a payment of £1,000 compensation. Again, this will now be payable to 
Mrs Ks estate, through her executor Mr K.
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint on behalf of Mrs K about Aviva Life & Pensions UK 
Limited. To put things right, I direct Aviva to do the following:
Pay Mrs Ks estate £2,916.48 compensation as described above.
Calculate and pay interest at 8% on this amount, to reflect the time Mrs K or her 
estate was without the use of the money.
Pay any cost the estate incurs having the interest calculated, if Aviva have been 
unable to complete the calculation within two weeks of being told my decision is 
accepted by Mrs Ks estate.
Pay Mrs Ks estate a further £1,000 compensation to acknowledge the prolonged 
distress this matter caused her.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mrs K 
to accept or reject my decision before 1 August 2023.
