The complaint
The estate of Mr B complains that Marsden Building Society has failed to properly explain a 
discrepancy on the late Mr Bs account statement.
The estate of Mr B is represented by his son Mr B who was duly appointed as the 
Administrator of Mr Bs estate in 2018. In this decision, for ease of reading, Ill refer to the 
complainant as Mr B, the Administrator.
What happened
Mr Bs late father had an account with Marsden. Mr B says that after the administration of his 
fathers estate had been concluded, he found a statement of his fathers account for 2010. 
The information on the statement indicated that the opening balance on 1 January 2010 was 
just over £111,000. There was a withdrawal on 23 November of just over £55,000 and the 
balance was marked as £0 after this withdrawal. Mr B asked Marsden to explain what had 
happened to the rest of the money in the account.
Marsden investigated what Mr B had told it. It said that the opening balance had been 
recorded incorrectly on the statement for 2010. It said it had checked its own records and the 
closing balance on 31 December 2009 had been just over £55,000. The statement for 2009 
showed this to be the case. There was no evidence of any transactions between 
31 December 2009 and 1 December 2010. So, it said the opening balance on the statement 
for 2010 was incorrect.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with this response. He referred his complaint to our service. Our 
investigator looked into his complaint. She said shed reviewed the statements for 2009 and 
2010. The balance at 31 December 2009 was just over £55,000. There was no evidence of 
any deposit between that date and 1 January 2010. So, she thought the opening balance on 
the 2010 statement was incorrect and the error was most likely caused by a typing or 
administrative error.
Mr B didnt agree. He said there wasnt a typing error as computers had been in place in 
2010. Our investigator thought about what hed said but she didnt change her view. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ultimately, what this complaint comes down to is whether one statement is correct over 
another. Mr B says that the statement which shows the opening balance in 2010 as 
£111,680.47 should be relied on, but Marsden says that this statement is incorrect and that 
the opening balance in 2010 was in fact £55,770.50. My role here is to be impartial and to 
consider whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. In doing so, where information 
is incomplete or contradictory, as some of it is here, I have to consider whats more likely 
than not to have happened, based on balance of all the evidence available to me.
Ive looked firstly at the statements for Mr Bs fathers account and compared these to the 
Investment Transaction report which Marsden has provided to us. 
The statement for 2008 shows that the balance at the start of 2008 was just over £92,000. 
There was a withdrawal of £40,000 on 28 October 2008. Ive been shown a copy of the 
withdrawal authority, in respect of this £40,000, signed by the late Mr B. The only credit to 
the account in 2008 was a payment of interest. So, the balance at the end of 2008 was just 
over £55,000. The Investment Transaction report confirms the information on the statement.
In 2009 the opening balance on the statement is the same as the closing balance for 2008. 
The only transaction on the statement is a credit for interest. The Investment Transaction 
report confirms this information is correct.
The dispute is really about the discrepancy between the statement for 2010 and the 
information on the Investment Transaction report for 2010. So, Ive looked closely at both of 
these documents.
The statement has an opening balance of £111,680.47. There is a receipt for interest 
credited on 23 November 2010. The balance entered after the receipt of the interest is 
£55,909.97. There is then an entry on that same date for a Manual Transfer of £55,909.97 
and the balance after that transaction is recorded as £0.00.
Having looked at the statement for 2010 it appears that either the opening balance is 
incorrect or the closing balance is incorrect. I say this because the transactions appearing on 
the statement do not add up. So, on balance of all the evidence here, Im persuaded that 
Marsdens version of events  that the information on this statement is incorrect, is more 
likely than not the situation here.
The opening balance at 1 January 2010 is significantly higher than the closing balance on 
the statement dated 31 December 2009. The closing balance on the 2009 statement 
(£55,770.50) plus the interest credited to the account on 23 November 2010 (£139.47) add 
up to £55,909.97. This is the same as the balance recorded on 23 November 2010 before 
the withdrawal is made. And, as our investigator said theres no evidence of any transactions 
between 31 December 2009 and 1 January 2010. Theres also no evidence of any 
transactions between 1 January 2010 and 23 November 2010 which would account for the 
discrepancy.
There are two transactions recorded on 23 November 2010. The first relates to interest. In 
previous years, interest was added to the account on 31 December. The second transaction 
on 23 November 2010 is for the full balance in the account. This was a manual transfer to 
another account with Marsden. 
Marsden has provided a copy of the late Mr Bs authorisation for this withdrawal. It is 
entitled  Closure Authority and it sets out the amount of the transfer. It is signed by the late 
Mr B. So, I think he was aware that he was closing the account at this time and he wouldve 
been aware of the amount of the closing balance he was transferring to the other account 
with Marsden. Theres no evidence to indicate that he was concerned about the closing 
balance on the account. The fact that interest was credited on 23 November 2010 is also 
indicative that it was closing interest that was being credited.
So, having considered the statements, the Investment Transaction reports and the evidence 
of the transactions on 23 November 2010, Im not persuaded, on balance, that the opening balance on the statement for 2010 is correct. Instead, Im satisfied that the opening balance 
on the Investment Transaction Report for 2010 is, more likely than not, correct.
I can understand why Mr B, as Administrator of his late fathers estate, has had to make sure 
that this discrepancy was fully investigated. But, having thought about everything here, Im 
satisfied that the opening balance recorded on the statement for 2010 was incorrect and, 
after the transactions on 23 November 2010, there are no further funds due to Mr Bs 
fathers estate in respect of the account.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint about Marsden Building Society.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr B 
to accept or reject my decision before 20 December 2021.
