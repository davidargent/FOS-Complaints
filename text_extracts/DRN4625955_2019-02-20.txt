K820x#14complaint
Miss B says The Co-operative Bank Plc (Co-op) mis-sold her a Privilege Premier packaged 
bank account  in 2007. Shes used a Claims Management  Company  (CMC) to complain.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  into Miss Bs complaint and didnt think the Privilege account 
had been mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Bs complaint. 
Our adjudicator set out in some detail why she thought the packaged account wasnt  mis-
sold. When the CMC disagreed, it simply asked for an ombudsmans  review didnt say what 
it thought our adjudicator got wrong. 
In any event, Ive looked  at the whole complaint again. And having  done so, I havent  seen  
anything to suggest Miss B was mis-sold her Privilege Premier account. As far as I can see, 
Miss B chose to switch to the packaged  account from a free one shed  had for well over a 
year. Miss B couldve used the benefits  and it was up to her to do so. And not needing  to do 
so, doesnt mean the account  was mis-sold.  I havent seen anything to suggest clearer  
information wouldve  changed her decision to take the account  either.  So, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Bs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 March 2019.
