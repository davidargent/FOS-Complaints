The complaint
Mrs J complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claim that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
What happened
Mrs J and her husband entered into a purchase agreement for some holiday club 
membership points in August 2010. The purchase price of the points was Â£7,900 and Mrs J 
used credit provided by Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the points. The credit was repaid 
in July 2011.
Mrs J complained to Barclays Partner Finance in April 2019 that the holiday company wasnt 
authorised to provide finance. Barclays Partner Finance said that she was out of time under 
the Limitation Act 1980 to bring any claim in respect of the issues that she claimed to have 
happened at the point of sale regarding the timeshare agreement. Mrs J wasnt satisfied with 
its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of her misrepresentation claim to 
turn it down and he didnt think that the timeshare provider breached the purchase 
agreement. 
Mrs J has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that she 
believes that the Limitation Act overrides the six year rule in her circumstances and she had 
up to ten years from the date of sale to make her claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Js complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Js complaint is that the holiday company wasnt authorised as a credit broker 
when the credit was provided to her but Barclays Partner Finance considered her 
claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
the Office of Fair Trading was responsible for authorising credit brokers at the time 
that the credit was provided to Mrs J and its my understanding that the holiday 
company was authorised as a credit broker at that time  I dont consider that Mrs J 
has provided enough evidence to support her claim that it wasnt appropriately 
authorised as a credit broker in August 2010;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Im not determining the outcome of a section 75 claim in this decision as only a court 
would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to Mrs J claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs J could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points in August 2010 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would 
have been incurred as that was when she used credit provided by Barclays Partner 
Finance to pay for the points;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner 
Finance until April 2019, more than eight years later, which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that any claim under section 75 would 
now be time-barred;
Mrs J says that she only became aware that she could make a claim to Barclays 
Partner Finance in February 2019  but when she had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist her for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mrs Js claim;
Mrs J says that she and her husband stopped paying maintenance fees to the 
holiday company a few years before 2019 because there had been multiple breaches 
of contract and the original sale wasnt lawful  but I dont consider that shes 
provided enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company;
Barclays Partner Finance issued a response to Mrs Js complaint in June 2019 in 
which it said that she was out of time under the Limitation Act to bring any claim  but 
it didnt directly respond to her complaint that the holiday company wasnt authorised 
to provide finance so I cant say that its response to her complaint was fair and 
reasonable  but if it had properly considered that issue I consider that it would have 
been fair and reasonable for it have not upheld her complaint; and
I sympathise with Mrs J for her husbands health issues, the financial difficulties that 
shes described and the issues that she and her husband have had with their holiday 
club membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the 
credit that it provided to her, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
