The complaint
Mr Z complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wont refund him for a purchase 
he didnt receive.
What happened
Mr Z bought an item online and paid for it using PayPal. The item was sent to Mr Z using a 
delivery company.
Mr Z says he didnt receive the item. Mr Z contacted PayPal and it started a buyer protection 
claim. PayPal investigated the claim but wouldnt refund Mr Z.
PayPal said Mr Z didnt qualify for buyer protection because the seller had provided proof of 
delivery. Mr Z felt this was unfair, hed paid for an item and hadnt received it.
Mr Z brought his complaint to this service. Mr Z said hed found out the driver for the delivery 
company had signed for the item, not Mr Z. 
Mr Z also said the distance selling regulations should protect him and PayPals only proof 
was the tracking number, and this shouldnt be enough to decline his buyer protection claim.
An investigator looked into things and didnt think Mr Zs complaint should be upheld. The 
investigator said theyd seen evidence from the delivery company showing the delivery driver 
was close to Mr Zs house on the day of delivery.
The investigator said the delivery driver had since returned to Mr Zs house and confirmed 
hed delivered the item to that address. And the investigator felt PayPal was fair in declining 
Mr Zs buyer protection claim as it had valid proof of delivery.
Mr Z was unhappy with this response. Mr Z felt the investigator had indirectly called him a 
liar by believing the delivery driver over him. Mr Z says the investigator had been misled by 
the delivery company on several points.
Mr Z says PayPal shouldnt be blindly relying on the delivery status and, as the losing party, 
he should be given the benefit of the doubt. Mr Z asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to decide whether PayPals treated Mr Z fairly when it declined his buyer protection 
claim. I can consider information from the seller and the delivery company where its relevant 
to Mr Zs complaint about PayPal.
PayPal processed the payment for Mr Z, it didnt send the item or guarantee its delivery in 
any way. But PayPal does have a buyer protection scheme, as part of its terms and 
conditions, which might help people who use PayPal get a refund for things they bought.
But PayPals buyer protection doesnt cover all eventualities and raising a claim doesnt 
entitle someone to a full refund. And for a buyer protection claim to be successful it must fit 
the specific terms PayPal lays out. PayPals buyer protection terms say:
Item Not Received claims
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if:
 You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, 
including if you use PayPal in a seller's retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR 
code goods and services transactions.
 The seller has provided proof of delivery.
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the 
goods.
Even though Mr Z claims he didnt receive the item this still doesnt entitle him to a refund 
from PayPal. And PayPal goes further in its description of proof of delivery, and says:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the "Transaction 
Details" page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
Ive looked at what the seller provided as proof of delivery and Im satisfied it fits the criteria 
PayPal wants. It follows that Im satisfied Mr Z doesnt qualify for a refund under PayPals 
buyer protection.
Mr Z says he should be able to make a claim under the distance selling regulations. From 
what I understand, Mr Z would need to claim from the seller not PayPal. But Id suggest Mr Z 
takes some legal advice if he feels this regulation applies to his purchase.
Mr Z says the investigator believed the delivery driver over him. I can see theres 
considerable dispute over whether the delivery driver delivered the item or made a second 
trip to Mr Zs house.
Mr Z also says a dispute over delivery times may mean hes entitled to a refund. Ive 
considered all this, but dont think its relevant. And Id like to make it clear Im not taking the 
delivery drivers word over Mr Zs.
The reason I dont feel this information is relevant is because the seller provided PayPal with 
the required delivery information. And this information is enough for PayPal to fairly decline 
Mr Zs buyer protection claim. Any further information about what may or may not have happened to the delivery doesnt 
change the delivery confirmation the seller provided PayPal. And so it doesnt change 
PayPals decision to decline the refund for Mr Z.
Mr Z says PayPal shouldnt be blindly relying on the delivery information. But this is exactly 
what PayPals terms say it needs. And since the relevant delivery information was provided 
to PayPal, I think its fairly declined Mr Zs request for a refund.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 October 2021.
