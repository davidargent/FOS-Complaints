* Loan 1 was a running credit facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans that 
Mr F took afterwards. 
The RCF allowed a consumer to either  request funds up to their agreed credit limit in one go 
or take multiple  drawdowns up to their limit. Each drawdown could be repaid via five monthly 
instalments. Mr F initially had a credit  limit of £500 which later appears to have  increased  to 
£750. 
In our latest  assessment our adjudicator didnt think it was wrong for Sunny to have  granted 
the RCF or the first five instalment  loans. But she thought the remaining instalment loans (6 
to 16) shouldnt have been  given.    
It appears Mr F accepted  our latest  adjudicators assessment. Sunny hasnt responded to 
the latest assessment. But it has already accepted  that something may have gone  wrong  
when it provided  loans 9 to 16, so it agreed to refund interest on these loans  together  with 
8% simple  interest.  It also agreed to update the credit file in line with the adjudicators  
recommendation.
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision, 
only dealing  with loans  6, 7 and 8.

My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr F doesnt appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt  wrong to 
grant the RCF and its drawdowns, or for Sunny  to lend loans 2 to 5. It seems therefore  this 
lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer  think that I need to make a finding about it. 
Ive also thought about that Sunny has made  an offer for loans 9  16 and for clarity Ive set 
out how I think Sunny should amend Mr Fs credit file for these loans.  
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted 
loans 6 to 8. These being the three  instalment loans lent between 17 August 2015 and
8 October 2015. But I have kept the other  lending in mind when thinking about the overall 
lending relationship between Sunny and Mr F. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to check  if Mr F could afford to pay back  
the amounts hed borrowed without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which  was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could  have taken  into account a number  
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Fs 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  stages  of a lending  
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr F. These  factors include:
Mr F having  a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr F having  a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated  refinancing may signal that the borrowing  
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr F coming  back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr F.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr F could sustainably repay his instalment loans  
not just whether he technically had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough 
money to make the repayments could of course  be an indicator that Mr F was able to repay 
his loans sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically  follow that this is the case. The Financial 
Conduct Authoritys  (the industry regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in 
particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable  commitments and without having 
to borrow to make them.  If a lender realises,  or ought reasonably  to have realised, that a 
Ref: DRN04894243borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows  
that it should conclude those repayments  are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Fs complaint.
Looking at the overall pattern of lending, I agree with our adjudicator  that Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful  at the 
time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 Mr F had been indebted to Sunny for around 12 months, including 9 
months since hed increased  his credit limit under the RCF in November 2014. In my 
view, Mr Fs overall loan history up until this point was a clear indication  that his 
underlying financial  situation didnt seem  to be improving; 
There were  no significant breaks  in lending following the increase in the RCFs credit 
limit. Most loans also overlapped, increasing  Mr Fs indebtedness.  For example, the 
first three instalment loans were taken  out when the RCF was still running and loan 6 
overlapped with loan 5. Loans were  also often being taken out in consecutive 
months. Such as from November  2014 to March  2015 and in July and August  2015. 
So Sunny ought to have  realised the signs  that Mr Fs finances  werent  getting  back 
on track, suggesting his indebtedness wasnt sustainable;
Mr F was borrowing  broadly similar  amounts  and, taken together with the pattern of 
borrowing, this suggests that he didnt just have a short-term  cash-flow problem  over 
this period, but a persistent shortage of funds which he was borrowing in order  to top 
up;    
Mr Fs lending history  was becoming prolonged since the increase in his credit limit 
under the RCF, suggesting  his situation wasnt improving. The lending then 
continued each  month throughout  2015  and into 2016 where it carried on without 
significant breaks until the end of that year.  Mr F took his highest  loans  of £500 and 
£650 towards the end of the lending relationship, indicating  that his financial position  
may even have deteriorated.  The amount of time that Mr F spent indebted to Sunny 
meant that hed paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny  
over an extended period.
I think that Mr F lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 to 16 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Fs
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loans 6 to 16 and Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
Putting things  right
Ref: DRN04894244Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  6 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove loans 6 to 16 from Mr Fs credit file entirely,  this is because the period of time 
Mr F owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded  about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Fs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr F as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
