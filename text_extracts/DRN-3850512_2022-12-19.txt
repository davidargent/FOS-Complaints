The complaint
A complains that it shouldve been given better exchange rates by National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
A had a euro account and GBP account with NatWest. Its trading income was in euros and 
from time to time it transferred Euros into its GBP account at the spot exchange rate. 
Between June 2017 and August 2018, A made 11 transfers totalling Euro220,924 into GBP 
 giving GBP192,934. The average rate was 0.873.
A complained. It said it asked for best rates each time it made transfers and was told there 
wasnt a better rate. But later, its director realised in 2019 that NatWest offered a preferential 
exchange rate for amounts over Euro100,000. A said that had it known, it wouldve waited 
until it had 100,000 Euros and then made a transfer at the preferential rate. A said that over 
the period between June 2017 and August 2018, it couldve got a rate of 0.9087, giving 
GBP200,754  a difference of GBP7,820. A said it should receive compensation of GBP 
15,000  to include the stress and anxiety caused. A first made its complaint in 2019 and 
then again in April 2021.
NatWest issued two final responses, and in both said theyd acted fairly. They said that any 
inter-currency payments greater than GBP100,000 may attract a better exchange rate, but 
this wasnt guaranteed. They said exchange rates fluctuate all the time, including several 
times during each day  so its impossible to guarantee a set exchange rate until a payment 
is made. So  while they accepted they had let A down, it was impossible to confirm whether 
A had incurred any loss or benefit from the exchange rates applied to the transfers.
NatWest also noted that A had used exchange rates from external sources to work out its 
losses. This wasnt something NatWest could accept as evidence of As claim. But NatWest 
apologised for its service failures and in 2019 paid compensation of £150; and in 2021, paid 
further compensation of £500.
A brought its complaint to us. Our investigator offered two views. The first view said NatWest 
acted reasonably. She didnt think that A couldve made transfers of over Euro100,000 even 
if it had known about the preferential rate. She noted that after A became aware of the 
preferential rate early in 2019, it still hadnt made any transfers of over Euro100,000. 
The second view said she was persuaded that A couldve collected enough money to make 
transfers of Euro100,000. So, she said NatWest should pay compensation of £2,289.94  
being the difference between the actual rate used on the transfers and a probable 
preferential rate.
NatWest didnt agree. They said there wasnt any evidence that A couldve had sufficient 
money to make the higher value transfers. They also said A hadnt made a transfer of the 
higher amount since it knew about the preferential rate. 
A asked that an ombudsman look at its complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two key aspects to As complaint:
- Did NatWest guarantee to give a better rate for transfers over Euro100,000?
- If they did, could A have benefitted from that, and by how much?
On the first question, NatWest argue it wasnt a guaranteed and fixed offer. NatWest said in 
their final response that they may apply a better exchange rate, however, this isnt 
guaranteed. But I saw an internal note from NatWest which said that they would normally 
apply lower margin (and therefore a better rate for a customer) for deals over Euro100,000. I 
suspect there is an element of negotiation around this  and ultimately, it was down to the 
trader to agree a rate with A based on a discussion at the time and in the light of the market 
on the day. But  NatWest (and our investigator) accept that for transfers over Euro100,000, 
a better rate would likely be applied. 
So  I consider that was the case here. And for that, NatWest have paid compensation of 
£650.
The second question is the crux of this complaint.  A argues that it has lost out by £7,820. To 
arrive at this figure, A assumes that a best in market rate of 0.9087 be applied to the 
transferred amount of Euro220,924  compared with the average rate used by NatWest for 
the transfers of 0.873 (note  this rate is not weighted by the value of the transfers). But I 
dont think its reasonable to use the best in market rate  its probable that NatWests 
preferential rate wouldnt be as good.
Our investigator then worked out  using exchange rates provided by NatWest  that the 
difference was £2,289.94  after deducting the compensation paid.
But, setting this aside, I dont think its reasonable to assume that A wouldve saved sufficient 
funds to make transfers of Euro100,000 in any case. I say that because:
- After A became aware of the availability of the preferential rate, early in 2019  it 
didnt make any such transfers over Euro100,000. So that implies that its cash flow 
wouldnt allow sufficient funds to be assembled to make such a transfer. 
- Or, if funds could have been built up  A chose not to make the larger transfers, 
despite knowing about the preferential rate. This suggests to me that it was unlikely 
that A wouldve have made the larger transfers between March 2017 and August 
2018.
I then considered what might have happened if A had saved sufficient money to make the 
larger transfers. I looked at the transfers made between June 2017 and August 2018  the 
period in question.
- To save up over Euro100,000, A would have had to wait between June 2017 and 
January 2018  to make one large transfer; instead of making the eight transfers it 
did make. It couldve done that and then made one transfer of approximately 
Euro100,000. But  to do so wouldve exposed A to an exchange risk. I say that as 
the market would continue to move during this period  while A built up its balances.  
The exchange rate couldve moved against it, or in its favour: we dont know, and it would depend on market conditions on the day of the larger transfer. And so  its not 
possible to say if A wouldve benefited or may have lost out.
- I then looked at the three transfers between March 2018 and August 2018  totalling 
Euro125,000. The same consideration applies here. There was an exchange rate risk 
in A waiting to build up the balance during that period. And if A did save up the 
amount and make one transfer of Euro100,000, it may, or may not have benefited, 
and depended on the market rate at the time of the larger transfer.
NatWest have accepted that they couldve done better and have paid compensation of £650. 
And looking at the evidence, Im not persuaded that A wouldve saved sufficient funds to 
make two larger transfers of Euro100,000. And even if it had done so, its not clear that A 
wouldve benefitted because it wouldve been exposed to market fluctuations during the 
periods in question. 
And therefore, my final decision is that NatWest dont need to do anymore here. I think they 
dealt with As complaint fairly and reasonably. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 January 2023.
