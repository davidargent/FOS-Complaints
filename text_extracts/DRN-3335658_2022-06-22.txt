The complaint 
Mr S and Mrs S have complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold 
them two packaged bank accounts. The first was called an Advantage Gold account and the 
second a Select Platinum account.
NatWest charged Mr S and Mrs S monthly fees for both accounts and provided several 
potential benefits in return. Mr S and Mrs S think that NatWest should refund them all the 
fees they paid, plus interest. 
What happened
Mr S and Mrs S have banked with NatWest for a long time. NatWest has sent us information 
about their account history, which shows that:
in 1991, they opened a fee-free account, 
in October 1999, NatWest sold them the Advantage Gold account, which replaced 
their fee-free account and for which it charged a monthly fee,
in July 2015, NatWest switched them to the Select Platinum Account and continued 
to charge a monthly fee,
This account history is not in dispute and I have taken it to be accurate. 
I understand that Mr S and Mrs S kept the Select Platinum account for several years, but I 
am not sure if they still have it. I also understand that in the early days the account was in 
Mrs Ss sole name. However, they have brought the complaint to us jointly and I have 
referred to them jointly throughout this decision.
One of our adjudicators has already looked into this complaint. The adjudicator didnt think 
that NatWest had mis-sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr S and Mrs S and had  treated 
them fairly when it switched them to the Select Platinum account.
Mr S and Mrs S didnt agree with the adjudicators findings and asked for an ombudsman to 
review their case. So, it has come to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about packaged bank accounts on our website,
and Ive used this approach to help me to decide what to do about this case. Ive looked into
everything that Mr S and Mrs S and NatWest have told us or sent us about the complaint 
and I have decided not to uphold it. I have explained why below. As the two events took 
place around 15 years apart, I have considered them separately.
The Advantage Gold account (1999)
In 1999, NatWest could sell packaged bank accounts, like the Advantage Gold account, in 
two ways. It could do so without giving personal advice on an information-only (or non-
advised) basis. Or, it could do so as an advised (or recommended) sale. In both
situations, I would have expected NatWest to give Mr S and Mrs S a choice and tell them 
about the Advantage Gold accounts costs and benefits clearly and fairly. And in an advised 
sale, I would also have expected it to check their circumstances to see if they needed the 
benefits which the Advantage Gold account could provide.
On our questionnaire, Mr S and Mr S said that NatWest recommended they should buy the 
Advantage Gold account during a discussion at the counter in one of its branches. NatWest 
has agreed it sold the account through a branch but has said it did so on an information-only 
basis.
Obviously, I wasnt present during the discussion, so I cant tell for sure what happened, but 
in 1999 NatWest did not usually give advice about packaged accounts. It generally sold 
them on an information-only basis. I havent seen convincing evidence that NatWest 
changed its usual approach for Mr S and Mrs S. So, I have considered this part of their 
complaint as being about an information-only sale. 
By the time NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr S and Mrs S, they had held a 
fee-free account for around eight years. I havent seen anything to make me think NatWest 
said they couldnt keep that account. So, Im satisfied that NatWest gave them a choice.
In recent correspondence with us, Mr S and Mrs S have highlighted the main reason they 
are complaining. They have told us that Natwest pressured them into buying the 
Advantage Gold account by telling them that they had to buy it if they wanted a loan or 
overdraft in future. Theyve explained that they expected to want to borrow in some way and 
so bought the account. They now think NatWest misled them about this and they could have 
had a loan or overdraft with their fee-free account. 
Firstly, I would like to confirm that Mr S and Mrs Ss current belief is correct. It is very rare for 
Natwest and other banks to decide whether a customer can have an overdraft or loan based 
on the type of account she or he holds. If NatWest was willing to grant Mr S and Mrs S an 
overdraft or loan with the Advantage Gold account, then its highly likely that it would also 
have allowed them a loan or overdraft with a fee-free account. So, if NatWest told them the 
opposite, it would have been wrong.
Obviously, I cant tell for sure what NatWest said, or didnt say, to Mr S and Mrs S during the 
discussion, but it has pointed out that before 1999 it had already allowed them an overdraft 
with a fee-free account. So, it seems extremely unlikely to me that it would have told them 
the opposite, as this would have contradicted their own experience. It would also have gone 
against its lending policy. However, at around that time, one of the potential benefits 
available to customers with Advantage Gold accounts was that NatWest would usually 
charge them lower interest on overdrafts and some personal loans than it applied to 
customers with fee-free accounts. NatWest may well have told Mr S and Mrs S that they 
could only have this benefit if they bought the Advantage Gold account. But as this would 
have been true, it wouldnt have been misleading. It would have been a fair think for 
NatWest to say. I think this is probably what it said. I fully accept that Mr S and Mrs S are 
doing their best to remember what happened, but I doubt that NatWest misled them or 
pressured them in the way they have described.
There isnt any dispute that NatWest told Mr S and Mrs S about the fees for the Advantage 
Gold account.In 1999, the accounts benefits included insurance for travel and extended warranties on 
some products bought through the account. I think its highly likely that NatWest told Mr S 
and Mrs S about these benefits. After all, it was trying to sell the Advantage Gold account to 
them and it was in its own interest to tell them what they could gain by buying it. Later on, it 
added other benefits to the account, such as insurance for mobile phones in 2006 and use of 
a car breakdown service in 2008. NatWest usually kept its customers up-to-date with these 
changes by writing to them, and Im confident that it did this for Mr S and Mrs S.
Mr S and Mrs S have also told us that when NatWest sold them the Advantage Gold account 
Mrs S had a medical condition, which they think may have made it difficult to claim on the 
travel insurance policy. However, in 1999 the policy probably covered them. Later on, 
NatWest made some changes and Mr S and Mrs S may have had to declare the condition, 
which may have still been covered, possibly for an additional fee. NatWest usually wrote to 
customers about this change and again Im confident it did this for Mr S and Mrs S.
Mr S and Mrs S have also told us that they made little active use of any of the Advantage 
Gold accounts benefits. Theyve said that they only recall using the car breakdown service 
once. I accept this, but it doesnt follow that NatWest did anything wrong when it sold them 
the account.
So, in summary, I doubt that NatWest misled Mr S and Mrs S that they had to buy the 
Advantage Gold account to get a loan or overdraft. And Im confident it allowed them a 
choice and told them about the accounts fees and benefits. I dont think that NatWest mis-
sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr S and Mrs S. 
The Select Platinum account (2015)
During 2015, NatWest decided to withdraw Advantage Gold accounts from its customers.
It did this for commercial reasons. Along with other banks it is allowed to make changes like 
this. However, to treat Mr S and Mrs S fairly, I would have expected it to tell them what was 
happening, give them fair notice and allow them reasonable choices if they werent happy 
with its intentions.
NatWest has told us that in 2015 it wrote to all customers about the changes it was
making and has sent us an example letter from the time. Im satisfied that NatWest sent
such a letter to Mr S and Mrs S.
The letter:
explained that NatWest was moving Mr S and Mrs S to the Select Platinum account 
because it was similar to the Advantage Gold account,
described the main differences in the benefits the two accounts could provide,
told Mr S and Mrs S about the monthly fees for the Select Platinum account.
The letter also explained to Mr S and Mrs S that if they didnt think the Select Platinum 
account was right for them, they could visit one of NatWests branches or ring NatWest to 
discuss other accounts, including some without a monthly fee.
It seems to me that NatWest met its obligation to Mr S and Mrs S when it sent them this 
letter. I think it treated them fairly in switching them to the Select Platinum account.During our investigation into this complaint, Mr S and Mrs S have mentioned that on several 
occasions staff at one of NatWests branches would not allow them to switch to a fee-free 
account. Theyve  said this may have been due to their  overdraft  but havent given us many 
details. NatWest didnt mention it in its final response letter. So, I have not considered it in 
this decision. This means that Mr S and Mrs S are free to raise it further with NatWest if they 
wish. However, I cant give them any advice about this or speculate on how NatWest may 
respond. Nor can I tell if any complaint they may subsequently bring to us will fall inside or 
outside the rules and time limits that determine which complaints we can investigate.  
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mr S and Mrs Ss complaint about
National Westminster Bank Plc. I am not going to tell it to give them any money back.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
