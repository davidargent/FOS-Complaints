The complaint
Mr H complains about the amount LeasePlan UK Limited trading as LeasePlan Go 
(LeasePlan) charged when he returned his vehicle.
 
What happened
Mr H entered into a hire agreement for a new vehicle with LeasePlan in September 2019. 
In 2020 Mr H applied for and was given two payment deferrals as his income had been 
affected by the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). Mr Hs payments were deferred for a total 
of six months. 
In May 2021 Mr H asked for a quote to terminate the agreement early, and LeasePlan sent 
Mr H an email with an indicative early termination quote of £745. 
Mr H continued with the early termination of his agreement in May 2021, and when the car 
was collected LeasePlan told him the outstanding balance was £3,228.50. Mr H complained 
to LeasePlan as theyd told him hed only need to pay £745 to end the agreement. 
LeasePlan sent Mr H their final response to his complaint in August 2021. They said the 
adviser that provided the figure of £745 hadnt realised that six of Mr Hs payments had been 
deferred as a result of Covid-19. They said the conditions of the deferral set out that any 
deferred payments would need to be made after the termination of the agreement, and this 
is why the full charge was £3,228.50. LeasePlan offered Mr H £200 compensation for the 
inconvenience caused. 
Unhappy with this, Mr H brought his complaint to this service for investigation. He said hed 
asked LeasePlan to confirm that £745 was all hed need to pay, and they had done so. Mr H 
said if hed known the figure was higher, he mightve come to a payment arrangement 
instead. 
Our investigator gave his view that when the payments were deferred, LeasePlan made Mr 
H aware that the payments would need to be paid when the agreement ended, so it wouldnt 
be fair to ask LeasePlan to reduce the outstanding debt. He said LeasePlan gave Mr H 
incorrect information when he asked to end the agreement, but he felt the £200 offered by 
LeasePlan was fair compensation for the mistake. 
Mr H didnt agree. He said he received the figure of £745 to terminate the agreement twice in 
writing, and so LeasePlan should honour this. Mr H said he believes hes paid enough 
money for the car, and it was returned in excellent condition and below the mileage 
allowance. 
As an agreement cant be reached, the case has been passed to me for a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H was supplied with a car under a hire agreement. This is a regulated consumer credit 
agreement which means were able to look into complaints about it. 
Theres no dispute that LeasePlan provided Mr H with unclear or incorrect information when 
he asked to end the agreement early. They told Mr H hed need to pay £745 when ending 
the agreement, but they didnt add the six deferred payments to the early termination quote. 
Mr H says that LeasePlan should honour the mistake and accept £745 in settlement of the 
agreement. 
When a business makes an error, we expect them to place the consumer back in the 
position they would have been in, if not for the error (as far as possible).
Ive seen the emails sent by LeasePlan to Mr H when they agreed to defer his payments as 
a result of Covid-19, and Im satisfied that these clearly explained that Mr H would need to 
repay the amount deferred once the agreement was terminated, or after the last full invoice 
had been billed at the end of the hire agreement. 
If LeasePlan hadnt made an error in the figure it gave Mr H, they wouldve included the six 
deferred payments, and so Im satisfied that these remain payable by Mr H and it wouldnt 
be reasonable to ask LeasePlan to accept a reduced amount because of the mistake. 
Mr H was put to distress and inconvenience by being given an incorrect sum. Once hed 
handed the car back and received the correct settlement figure this came as a surprise and 
left him concerned about how hed be able to meet a large payment. LeasePlan have offered 
Mr H £200 compensation in recognition of this. All things considered, I think this fairly 
compensates Mr H for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr H said if LeasePlan had given him the correct figure when he asked to end the 
agreement early, he mightve arranged a repayment plan instead. LeasePlan offered to set 
up a payment plan for Mr H, so he may wish to contact them to discuss this option if he 
requires it. 
Mr H said hed paid enough toward the car at the time it was returned. Mr H had use of the 
vehicle while his payments were deferred, so whilst I appreciate that Mr H felt hed paid 
enough toward the car, Im satisfied that the deferred payments still needed to be made at 
the time the agreement was terminated. 
Mr H has said that the car was returned below the allowed mileage. Whilst I accept that the 
mileage allowance wasnt exceeded, and Mr H had used the car less than hed expected to 
as a result of Covid-19, there is nothing in the agreement terms that say LeasePlan must 
take unused mileage into account when the agreement ends.
 
Putting things right
For the reasons outlined above, Im satisfied that the six payments that Mr H deferred 
remained payable at the end of the agreement. Mr H may wish to ask LeasePlan about a 
payment arrangement for the remaining amount owed under the agreement. 
LeasePlan gave Mr H incorrect information about what hed need to pay when the 
agreement was terminated, and they should pay Mr H the £200 offered in compensation for 
the error. My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint, and LeasePlan UK Limited trading as 
LeasePlan Go must pay Mr H £200 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2022.
