K821x#15Complaint
Mr T has complained that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) failed to 
reduce the arrears on his account  after he made the payment it requested.
Background
Mr T was provided with a personal loan by 118 118 Money in March  2018. The loan was for 
£2,950.00 and due to be repaid in 24 monthly  instalments of £285.49. By December 2018, 
Mr T had fallen  behind  with his payments. 118 118 Money told Mr T that it would  waive the 
outstanding arrears of £606.47 provided he made a payment of £50 by 31 December 2018. 
For whatever reason,  Mr T didnt make the £50 payment  by this date. He managed to get in 
contact with 118 118 Money  on 7 January 2019 and during the ensuing phone call Mr T was 
told the offer to waive the £606.47 remained in place as long as he made  a £50 payment 
that same  day. Mr T did make the requested payment  on 7 January 2019  but it subsequently  
transpired that 118 118 Money didnt waive the £606.47 in arrears as promised. After  Mr T 
complained about this 118 118 Money  said that the offer to waive  the arrears was made  in 
error and it wasnt prepared to make  the adjustments promised to Mr Ts account.
Mr T remained dissatisfied at 118 118 Moneys  response and referred  his complaint to us. 
Mr Ts complaint was looked at by one of our adjudicators. He thought it was unfair that    
118 118 Money didnt reduce the balance on Mr Ts account and so upheld the complaint. 
118 118 Money disagreed and instead offered  Mr T £75 for any distress  and inconvenience 
its agents error might have caused. As Mr T didnt accept 118 118 Moneys alternative 
settlement offer the case was passed  to an ombudsman for a final decision.    
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Im upholding Mr Ts complaint. Id like to explain the 
reasons why.
It isnt in dispute that the original terms of the offer 118 118 Money  made to Mr T required 
him to make  payment by 31 December  2018 and that he didnt manage to do so. I also 
appreciate that 118 118 Money did send  him a number of text messages reminding  him of 
this. However, it also isnt in dispute  that, on 7 January 2019,  118 118 Moneys telephone 
agent told Mr T that the offer would be honoured if he made payment by the end of the day. 
118 118 Money says that this offer was made in error. But written record  of this call indicates  
that the agent checked (its unclear how or who with) before confirming Mr T was still eligible 
for the offer (to waive the arrears  of £606.47) as long as he paid £50 that same day. Equally, 
the written record also indicates  118 118 Money knew that Mr T would  be going to the 
trouble of obtaining funds from someone  else, in order to make the £50 payment. 
Given the offer was once again  made, Mr T reasonably relied on it and additionally went to 
the trouble of obtaining the necessary  funds  from someone else, I dont think  it was fair and 
reasonable for 118 118 Money  not to honouring the offer it made, once it received payment 
irrespective of whether  this was made  in error.  In these  circumstances,  Im satisfied 118 118 
Ref: DRN94790832Money should now adjust Mr Ts account to reflect the credit that should have been made on 
7 January 2018.
I now turn to the current status of Mr Ts account.  As I understand it Mr Ts account was sold 
to a third-party debt purchaser. This is a course of action a lender  is entitled to take whether 
or not an account  is in arrears. So I dont think that it was unfair for 118 118 Money to have 
sold Mr Ts account notwithstanding the circumstances. And Im not going  to require it to buy 
the account back. Bearing this in mind, I think that 118 118 Money now needs  to put things 
right using one of the methods in the section below.
Fair compensation  what  118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr T 
Having carefully considered everything, I think it would be fair for 118 118 Money  to put 
things right for Mr T using  one of the methods  below. So 118 118 Money should:
EITHER
Buy back  the debt from the third-party purchaser  and make  the necessary 
adjustments to ensure that it is in the position it would be in had the credit  of £606.47 
been made on 7 January 2019; AND
Arrange a suitable repayment plan for any remaining balance on Mr Ts account.
OR 
Pay the third-party debt purchaser, or Mr T should it wish to instead, an amount to 
reflect the credit that now needs to be made to place Mr Ts account  in the position it 
would be in had the adjustment of £606.47 been  made on 7 January 2019.
Mr T is entitled  to direct  any concerns about the collection of any outstanding amount to the 
third-party debt purchaser in the event a debt remains with it and Mr T considers that he is 
being treated  unfairly.   
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2021.
