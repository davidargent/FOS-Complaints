The complaint
Mr As complaint is about overdraft charges on his current account.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Santanders terms and conditions, which Mr A agreed to when he opened the 
account and arranged an overdraft limit, say it will apply charges for being 
overdrawn. These charges were made clear to Mr A. Santander also sent him a 
number of letters showing his arranged overdraft limit, his overdrawn balance and 
account statements showed what he was being charged and why. Mr A also had 
access to online banking where the charges and the account balance were readily 
available to view.
So, when Mr A went over his agreed overdraft limit on several occasions Santander 
was entitled to apply the unarranged overdraft charge of Â£6 a day. 
On balance, I think Santander has acted reasonably throughout and has fairly 
applied the charges in line with its terms and conditions. And I dont think I can fairly 
or reasonably require it to do anything more or differently. 
 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My Final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Santander UK Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
