K820x#14Complaint
Mr C complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc wont extend the term of his interest  
only mortgage which was due to end in January  2018. He also says NatWest mis-sold the 
mortgage to him as it shouldve been set-up over 25 years  and NatWest didnt make sure he 
had a suitable repayment vehicle in place.
Background
In 2007 Mr C took out a buy to let mortgage  with NatWest on a property he let to a private  
tenant. The mortgage consolidated three  separate mortgages. The mortgage offer from the 
time confirms the mortgage was to be set-up on an interest only basis,  running for 10 years  
and 6 months. It also says NatWest  did not recommend a particular mortgage  it was for Mr 
C to choose whether to accept the mortgage offer. Mr C accepted the offer.
NatWests contact notes  show it granted Mr C permission  to build a second  property  on the 
land in 2015. But when the mortgage was due to be repaid  January 2018  the building 
work was still incomplete. Before that  in January 2017   NatWest wrote  to Mr C to remind 
him that the mortgage was due to end in January 2018. 
Mr C responded in March  2017, asking to extend the term by three years.  NatWest  noted the 
relevant details of Mr Cs request and sent him confirmation of the valuation  fee and income 
and expenditure  questionnaire, which Mr C had said he would complete and return by May 
2017. NatWest chased  Mr C to return the questionnaire in May and July of 2017,  before 
writing to him in January  2018 for his proposal  to repay  the mortgage.
Mr C responded in January, saying he did not earn enough to meet  NatWests criteria  for the 
term extension.  So NatWest said he could have three months to arrange a remortgage or six 
months to sell the property. Mr C opted  to sell the property and NatWest extended the term 
for six months.
After the six month extension expired,  Mr C explained to NatWest he was having  difficulty 
evicting his tenant and had to start court proceedings.  NatWest  agreed not to contact Mr C 
for a further three months.
In November 2018, Mr C told NatWest his tenant  was still in the property, but that the 
property was being marketed for sale, albeit with only one photograph, as the tenant would 
not allow him entry to take more. He said legal action to evict his tenant  was continuing.
In January 2019, Mr C told NatWest  his tenant had moved out of the property, but hed had 
no viewings. NatWest agreed to put its action on hold for a further 30 days. When it didnt 
hear from Mr C after 30 days, it defaulted the mortgage account. 
Mr C complained and NatWest responded in April 2019. NatWest  didnt uphold Mr Cs 
complaint saying no mortgage advice  was given but it had told him there was a requirement 
for a repayment vehicle.  In its letter NatWest quoted the mortgage  offer,  which said:
You will still owe Â£137,300 (the original mortgage  amount)  at the end of the 
mortgage term. You will need to make  separate arrangements to pay this.
Unsatisfied with NatWests response, Mr C brought his complaint to us. He says he cant sell 
the property at full market  value as he has a half built property on the land.  And he cant  
Ref: DRN37342882afford to finish building the property because NatWest wants  him to repay his mortgage. So 
he wants his mortgage extended to allow him time to finish building the second property. Mr 
C also says hes losing  money, as he cant let the property because  it needs to be sold and 
NatWest still requires  monthly mortgage payments.
Our investigator didnt  think NatWest  has done anything wrong. With regard to the mis-sale 
compliant, he said:
At the time of the mortgage application, lenders  werent required to see proof of a 
repayment vehicle;
The illustration and the offer clearly say the mortgage was to be on an interest  only 
basis, with a term of ten years and six months,  and that the full amount of the 
mortgage loan will still be owed at the end of the mortgage term;
The application was made on a non-advised basis.
With regard to NatWests actions at the end of the contractual term, our investigator  said:
He thinks NatWest  has acted  fairly  and reasonably;
A lender is entitled to ask for full repayment at the end of a mortgage term;
NatWest has given  additional time for Mr C to sell the property but cant  do this 
indefinitely.
Mr C disagreed with our investigators opinion, so his complaint has been passed to me for a 
final decision.
 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with our 
investigator. Ill explain why.
To reach my decision Ive thought about whether NatWest should  have acted  differently  at 
the time of Mr Cs mortgage application. And Ive thought about whether NatWest has acted 
reasonably in relation to it decision not to extend the mortgage term further.
Mr Cs mortgage application in 2007
The documentation  from the time of the application  says it was a non-advised sale.  Mr C 
was an experienced borrower  I say this because I know that hes had at least  three  
mortgages before this one. And the money  he borrowed under the mortgage was to fund an 
investment property  not his primary residence.  I think his profile  fits with someone who 
may not require advice.  So I dont think NatWest did anything wrong by carrying out a non-
advised application. And I havent seen anything that would suggest Mr C did receive advice. 
As I think  it was reasonable for the application  to have been non-advised and I dont think  
advice was given,  I think Mr C chose  the mortgage term and repayment method. 
Given the wording in the offer, I think  the consequences of taking an interest only mortgage  
were clear. It explained that the full amount would still be payable at the end of the mortgage  
term and it confirmed the need to make separate arrangements  to pay it. I think  this was 
reasonably prominent in the mortgage  offer. But I also think  Mr Cs previous experience 
makes it more likely  that hed have known this.
Ref: DRN37342883I think Mr C chose the term of his mortgage  and I think he would have  known what was likely 
to be required at the end of the term - given  the repayment type he chose. So I dont think  
NatWest should  have acted differently at the time of the application.
NatWests actions at the end of the mortgage  term
Ive thought about whether NatWest  has given Mr C enough  time to sell his property   or 
make alternative arrangements  and whether it is now reasonable that it starts possession 
action. And Ive thought about this with all the circumstances  in mind, such  as the building 
work, the type of mortgage,  as its non-residential, and the economic climate,  as Mr C has 
mentioned that.
NatWest reminded Mr C that his mortgage  was due for repayment one year in advance.  In 
doing so I think  it gave him reasonable time to ensure he was prepared for the due date  
without the pressure of NatWest  chasing  him for repayment. At that time, Mr C could have 
marketed the property for sale, applied to remortgage with another  lender and/or sourced the 
funds required to complete his building project. It isnt clear  whether he took any such action 
at that time or whether he wouldve been  successful. But I think  NatWest  acted reasonably  in 
alerting Mr C a year an advance of the mortgage  becoming due.
Mr C did take action  in March 2017 when  he asked NatWest to extend the mortgage term by 
three years. It looks like NatWest were  willing to consider this request as it sent Mr C an 
income and expenditure form and chased  him twice for its return. I wouldnt expect it to do 
more here and I think its reasonable that NatWest would want  to be satisfied Mr C could 
maintain the payments. I say this because I think Mr Cs request would mean a significant 
change to the terms of the original mortgage  offer,  agreed  in 2007.
When NatWest asked  for Mr Cs intentions to repay the mortgage in January  2018,  he said 
he couldnt prove the income required by NatWest  to extend the mortgage term. NatWest  
offered him an extension  of three months to remortgage or six months  to sell the property. I 
think these are reasonable  allowances for NatWest  to make - particularly because I think  Mr 
C wouldve known in March 2017 that he couldnt  satisfy NatWests income requirement for 
the three year term extension.
NatWest made allowances for the issues around Mr Cs tenant by putting  a hold on any 
further action. In practice, it did so until Mr C confirmed  his tenant had left the property  in 
January 2019.  NatWest  then agreed a further 30 days before taking the first steps towards 
possession. So NatWest  has allowed additional  time on several occasions to give Mr C time 
to sell the property  or make alternative arrangements.  I think the additional time NatWest 
has allowed  over one year  is reasonable in the circumstances.
I know Mr C has had issues with his tenant and faces difficulty around the issue  of the 
partially built property.  And he says the continued uncertainty  around Britain leaving the 
European Union (Brexit) is having a negative  impact on the housing  market. I think  NatWest 
has made fair allowances  for the issues  with the tenant. But I dont think it can be expected  
to wait indefinitely  for the building work to be completed. And I dont think  its reasonable for 
it to be expected to make  allowances  for the current effects of Brexit, when it can have no 
way of knowing what the future effects  of it will be.
Ref: DRN37342884I would like to comment on one final point.  Mr C has recently told us he thinks NatWest  has 
entered into a contract with him, by telling him to market the property  for sale and taking 
mortgage payments  after the contractual term had expired. 
Im not here to decide  what constitutes  a legal contract  though I dont  think  what Mr C 
describes does. Instead, Ive looked at whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
NatWest allowed the mortgage to run past the contractual term to give Mr C reasonable 
opportunity to sell his property or arrange a remortgage. But he still owed the full amount of 
the loan to NatWest.  So I think it was reasonable for it to continue  to charge him interest - 
and so take mortgage payments - until the loan was repaid. It doesnt mean NatWest is 
obliged to extend the mortgage term.
In summary,  I dont think NatWest mis-sold Mr Cs mortgage in 2007 and I think  its acted 
reasonably in relation to the mortgage  term ending.
my final decision
Given the above, I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 November 2019.
