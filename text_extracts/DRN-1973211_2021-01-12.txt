DRN-1973211
The complaint
Mr B complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to him the additional amount that hes 
claimed in relation to the supply and fitting of a bathroom.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B used his Lloyds Bank credit card in August 2019 to pay £7,660.20 for a 
bathroom to be supplied and fitted  the bathroom fittings were supplied but the 
supplier stopped trading before the bathroom was fitted so Mr B paid £2,645 for the 
fitting to be completed;
he made a claim to Lloyds Bank under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
and it credited £2,645 to his account in December 2019 to reimburse him for the 
additional fitting costs  but Mr B says that hes calculated the retail cost of the 
fittings as £3,348.21 which, added to the fitting costs of £2,645, totals £5,993.21 but 
he paid £7,660.20 to the supplier so he says that he's paid £1,666.99 which he has 
nothing to show for  so he complained to this service;
our investigator said that the refund of £2,645 from Lloyds Bank had put Mr B back in 
the same position he would have been in had the supplier not stopped trading so 
Mr B hadnt suffered any loss and it was a fair resolution to his complaint - Mr B has 
asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman but he says that hed be 
willing to accept half of the amount that hes claimed;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier
to be able to uphold Mr Bs complaint about Lloyds Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
bathroom and that Lloyds Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair 
or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
its clear that there was a breach of contract because the supplier stopped trading 
before the bathroom had been supplied and fitted  he paid an additional £2,645 for 
the fitting to be completed and Lloyds Bank has reimbursed him for that amount so 
hes been put back into the position that he wouldve been in had the fitting been 
completed by the supplier  and I consider that to be a fair and reasonable remedy 
for the breach of contract;
Mr B had agreed for the supplier to supply and fit the bathroom and he paid it 
£7,660.20  hes received the bathroom that he paid for, hes been reimbursed for 
the additional amount that he paid to the fitter and Im not persuaded that theres any 
evidence to show that he entered into the contract with the supplier as a result of a 
misrepresentation; and
I consider that Lloyds Bank has responded to Mr Bs complaint fairly and reasonably 
and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require it to refund to Mr B all, or any part, of the £1,666.99 that hes claimed, 
to pay him any other compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2021.
