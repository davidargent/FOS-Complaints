The complaint
Miss B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) treated a currency 
conversion unfairly.
What happened
Miss B agreed to buy a laptop, and on 15 February 2021, made a payment of SEK6,490 
(Swedish Krona) from her PayPal account. This was debited to her linked bank account  
GBP591.59. She cancelled the purchase and on 24 February 2021, received a refund of 
SEK6,490 into her PayPal account. This was converted to GBP553.0 when it was returned 
to her bank account. 
Miss B complained. She said shed chosen to have the currency conversion done by her 
linked bank account for the payment  and when the refund was made, PayPal shouldve 
given her the option of doing the same. But instead, PayPal converted it at their own rates. 
This meant shed lost the difference of GBP38.50  shes a student, and this was money she 
couldnt afford to lose.
PayPal said theyd received SEK and had to convert it into GBP at their rates on the day it 
was received.  This was in accordance with their terms and conditions  which Miss B had 
signed up to.
Miss B bought her complaint to us. Our investigator said the refund from the merchant was 
for SEK6,490 and that had to be converted into GBP. This was contained in PayPals User 
Agreement. He hadnt seen anything which enabled a customer to opt to choose where a 
currency conversion takes place  i.e. at PayPal or at a bank. And so  PayPal had acted 
fairly.
Miss B asked that her complaint be looked into by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that on 15 February 2021, Miss B made a payment of SEK 6,490 from her PayPal 
account. She had two debit cards and a credit card linked to her PayPal account. The 
default funding card was denominated in GBP  so that was the card that was used by 
PayPal to fund the payment. And so  for the payment, GBP591.59 was drawn from Miss 
Bs debit card  and at the rates given by her bank. When the refund was made  on 24 
February 2021, SEK6,490 was received by PayPal  and they converted this to GBP553.00. 
This amount was then refunded back to the same linked debit card. But  the conversion of 
the refunded amount was done by PayPal and at their rates  so there was a difference in 
the amount that Miss B got back.
Miss B argues that she was able to nominate the card she used to make the payment, but 
not for the incoming refund. And  she said this was unfair.
I can see where shes coming from. But  the basic consideration here is that her PayPal 
account was a GBP account, not a currency account in, for example, SEK. And so  any 
payments into it had to be converted into GBP by PayPal. 
I can see that this was included in their User Agreement which says If you receive a 
payment from anyone who doesn't have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency 
which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the 
amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the 
payment is made.
I did observe from PayPals records that Miss B also had a debit card linked to her PayPal 
account - denominated in SEK. And  I think that if shed used that card for the original 
payment, PayPal wouldve made the refund back to that card  in SEK, and so  Miss B 
wouldnt then have lost out.
I can appreciate that Miss B has lost money here, which she cant afford to lose. But  we 
must take a balanced view as between PayPal and Miss B, considering the views of both 
sides. And in this case, I think PayPal acted fairly and in line with their User Agreement, and 
the way they would normally deal with a refund such as this.
I appreciate that Miss B will be disappointed by my decision, but Im not going to ask PayPal 
to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 November 2021.
