The complaint
Mr M complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont let him withdraw funds form his 
PayPal account in US dollars
What happened
Mr M said hed US dollars paid into his personal PayPal account, and he wanted to withdraw 
the funds in the same currency. But he said PayPal said the funds had to be exchanged into 
the currency the account had been opened with. Mr M said this meant PayPal charged him 
significant conversion fees. Mr M said hed linked a funding source to his account for US 
dollars but still PayPal are charging him fees. Mr M also said hed been given conflicting 
information about what he needed to do to resolve the issue. He complained to PayPal.
PayPal said the withdrawal of US dollars to a US dollar funding source without incurring a 
conversion fee wasnt an option for a UK PayPal account. They said Mr M could hold, send 
and receive US dollars on his PayPal account. And he can use his US dollar funding source 
to fund US dollar transactions. But any withdrawal made on his UK PayPal account would 
convert to British pounds sterling (GBP) which is the opening currency of the account and 
the transaction exchange rate would be used to convert from US dollars to GBP.
Mr M wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said that PayPal had acted in accordance with their User Agreement in 
converting the US dollars into GBP. But he said PayPals customer service had been poor 
as the conversion process had been poorly explained to Mr M caused confusion and 
expectations for Mr M in being able to withdraw the funds in the currency of his choosing. 
Our investigator said PayPal should compensate Mr M £100  for the distress and 
inconvenience this caused.
PayPal didnt agree they said the process had been fully explained to Mr M but he hadnt 
accepted this and kept trying to find alternative ways of being able to withdraw the funds in 
US dollars. PayPal asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
When Mr C opened his account with PayPal he would have agreed to their User Agreement. 
So Ive considered its terms and conditions when reaching my decision.
PayPals User Agreement says:
You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we 
agree otherwise. In order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have 
to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for 
you at the time of your withdrawal. Our transaction exchange rate will be used.
And goes on to explain that:
A PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your 
account, the conversion into your original opening currency will be performed using 
our transaction exchange rate.
To a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency 
other than the original opening currency of your account, the conversion into the 
currency in which the funding source is denominated will be performed using our 
transaction exchange rate.
So Im satisfied PayPal are clear in their terms and conditions about how and in what 
currency Mr M could make withdrawals. And that any conversion would incur an exchange 
rate fee.
Ive considered what happened when Mr M contacted PayPal to see if there was a way for 
him to withdraw funds without incurring a fee.
From PayPals records I can see that Mr M was told the information as outlined above. But I 
can see when he asked about the impact of having a US dollar account, he  was also told he 
would be able to withdraw US dollars to a US dollar account. And it was this that I think 
caused the confusion as from here Mr M tried to add a US dollar account (credit card) to his 
UK PayPal account.
PayPals User Agreement says:
We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and 
receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.
But while Mr M can store, send and receive payments in currencies in his UK PayPal 
account other than the opening currency, for Mr M to withdraw money from his UK PayPal 
account, as outlined previously  it can only be in the opening currency of his account.
But when Mr M was told hed be able to withdraw US dollars to a US dollar account I can 
see he understood this to mean he could withdraw the US dollars through his US dollar 
credit card. I can see this caused Mr M some distress and inconvenience as he followed the 
instructions he was given thinking that this would enable him to withdraw the funds in his 
chosen currency only to have payments blocked and denied.
So I agree with our investigator that PayPal didnt provide a clear explanation to Mr M which 
caused him unnecessary distress and inconvenience. And PayPal should pay Mr M £100 for 
this. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And ask PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr M £100 for 
distress and inconvenience.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2023.
