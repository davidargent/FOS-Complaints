The complaint
Mr W has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has blocked his account without 
providing an explanation.
What happened
In 2018 Mr W became aware that his account with PayPal had been blocked. He complained 
to it about this. PayPal told him that a permanent limitation had been applied to his account 
due to a violation of its acceptable use policy.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ws complaint. He explained why he didnt think 
PayPal had done anything wrong. Mr W didnt agree with the investigators view, so the 
complaint has been passed to me for review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so Ive decided not to uphold 
Mr Ws complaint. Ill explain why.
The user agreement Mr W would have agreed to when he opened his account with PayPal, 
sets out the terms on which PayPal operates the account. And these allow it to limit or close 
the account if it wishes to do so. 
Having reviewed the use of Mr Ws account, PayPal identified an issue with the use of it and 
decided to permanently limit the use of the account. I understand Mr Ws frustration in not 
being given a detailed reason as to why PayPal has done this, but it isnt obliged to do so. 
And its a matter of commercial judgement on PayPals part if it chooses to finish its 
relationship with Mr W. 
Im satisfied that PayPal followed its processes and the terms of its user agreement. So, I 
dont think its done anything wrong by permanently limiting Mr Ws account. 
My final decision
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2020.
