K821x#15complaint
Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that Sunny ought to have known that he couldnt afford to repay the payday loans. And 
the lending trapped him in a debt spiral.

When Mr S first made his complaint. Sunny offered to refund the interest  and charges he 
had paid on loans  1 to 4. Mr S didnt accept this offer. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He didnt look at loans 1 to 4 due to the offer 
Sunny had made. He thought that Sunny shouldve performed better checks  before 
approving loans 5 and 6 but he couldnt  say what these checks  wouldve shown. But, he 
thought Sunny should pay compensation for loans 7 to 12 as the pattern of lending  itself was 
evidently harmful. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said it had made the offer to pay 
compensation on loans 1 to 4 in error and it withdrew it. It also didnt agree that it should pay 
compensation in respect of loans 7 and 8 but it did agree to pay compensation in respect of 
loans 9 to 12. 
Our adjudicator then looked at loans  1 to 4 and agreed that Sunny wasnt wrong  to approve 
these loans. But he still thought that it should  pay compensation in respect of loans 7 to 12. 
Ref: DRN03862292Mr S representative responded and said that Mr S didnt want to accept the most recent 
offer Sunny had made. It agreed that the interest  and charges  Mr S had paid on loans 7 to 
12 should be refunded to him. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been  passed to me to consider. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr S complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr S complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Ref: DRN03862293Mr S has accepted our adjudicators opinion about  loans 1 to 6. Because of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making a decision  about 
this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr S had with Sunny. So they 
are something I will take into account when  considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 12 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr S, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr S case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out seven loans in just over five months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr S was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr S first loan was for £750.  Loan  7 was for £250 but Mr S hadnt  been able to repay 
loan 6 which was for £600. So the total amount he had outstanding was £850. This is 
around a third of his total income which seems to be a high amount still to need to 
borrow after over five months. At this point Sunny ought to have  known that Mr S was 
not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
Throughout this lending relationship Mr S was provided with a new loan within  a very 
short time of settling a previous  one. And he often  had more  than one loan running  at 
the same  time. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out 11 months after Mr S first. He had been  unable  to repay loans 10 and 11 
and when he started loan 12. Overall Mr S had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr S indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr S ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 12 and Sunny should put things right as 
set out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 7 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
Ref: DRN03862294the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 12 should be removed from 
Mr S credit file.
If Mr S still owes Sunny  any of the principal balance he borrowed on loans 10, 11 and 12  
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.  Sunny  
should then re-work  the account as if all payments made by Mr S went  to towards the 
principal. But importantly,  Sunny needs  to make sure that Mr S doesnt repay more  than the 
principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr S hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr S has already paid enough to repay the principal  
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr S.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr S complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2020.
