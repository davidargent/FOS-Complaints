The complaint
Miss K is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA reported missed payments to her
credit file and with the date that they reported defaulting her account.
What happened
In March 2021, Miss K entered into a plan with a debt charity, which contacted PayPal and
advised that Miss K wouldnt be able to make the full contractually required monthly
payments to her PayPal credit account in the immediate future and explained what amount
of monthly payment Miss K could afford to make, and so would be making, moving forwards.
Miss K made the reduced, affordable payments to PayPal for the next several months. But
she was unhappy to learn that PayPal had reported missed payments to her credit file for
those months, April through July 2021. Miss K was also unhappy that PayPal had then
defaulted her account for non-payment and felt that if PayPal were going to have defaulted
her account, they should have done it sooner. So, she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Ks complaint. They confirmed that the monthly payments theyd
received from Miss K, via the debt charity, werent enough to meet the contractual monthly
payment requirements on the account, which had meant that arrears had accrued on the
account which had grown with each passing month. As such, PayPal didnt feel that theyd
acted unfairly by following account arrears process that they had, including reporting the
missed payments to the credit reference agencies and defaulting the account when they did.
Miss K wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt it should have been apparent to
PayPal when they were contacted by the debt charity that Miss K wouldnt be able to make
the contractually required monthly payments moving forwards and so recommended that
PayPal amend the date of default to when they contacted by the debt charity in March 2021.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 30 June 2023 as follows:
When Miss K engaged the debt charity to help her with her finances  which resulted 
in the debt charity advising PayPal in March 2021 that Miss K wouldnt be able to 
make the full contractually required monthly payments in the immediate future  this 
didnt absolve Miss K of her requirements as per the credit agreement shed entered 
into with PayPal to make at least the minimum contractually required monthly 
payments to her PayPal account.
As such, when Miss K then proceeded, via the debt charity, to make reduced 
payments to PayPal from April 2021 onwards, Im satisfied that she was in breach of 
the credit agreement, because she was making monthly payments that were less 
than the minimum monthly amount required on the credit account.
Because of this, Im satisfied that it was fair and reasonable for PayPal to then report 
to the credit reference agencies that Miss K didnt make the contractually required 
monthly payments for the months of April through July 2021. And I say this because 
Im satisfied that this reporting by PayPal was factually correct.
Its clear that Miss K feels that she never missed a monthly payment to PayPal. But 
to have made a monthly payment for credit file reporting purposes means to have 
made a payment thats equal to or above the minimum monthly payment amount 
thats contractually required on that credit account.
And because Miss K made monthly payments of less than the minimum monthly 
amount that was contractually required of her, as per the credit agreement  and 
regardless of whether she did so having engaged a debt charity or not  shes 
considered to have not fulfilled her contractual payment obligations towards the 
account such that its reported as a missed payment to her credit file. This feels fair 
to me, and as explained above, Im satisfied that the reports PayPal have made to 
the credit reference agencies does present an accurate record of the reduced 
payments that Miss K made.
Miss K is also unhappy with the date PayPal defaulted her account and feels PayPal 
should have dated the default to when they were first contacted by the debt charity in 
March 2021. The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) issues guidance on 
when a credit provider such as PayPal should consider defaulting a credit account for 
the non-payment of account arrears. This guidance includes that a credit provider 
should generally provide a notice to an account holder that their account may be 
defaulted when that account has fallen into around three months of arrears, and that 
an account should be defaulted preferably before an account falls into more than six 
months of arrears.
Having reviewed how PayPal handled the defaulting of Miss Ks account, Im 
satisfied that theyve acted in line with the ICO guidance here. I say this because 
PayPal issued a default notice to Miss K on 21 July 2021 at a time when her account 
was three months in arrears and defaulted her account for non-payment the following 
month.
I also dont agree that PayPal should be asked to backdate the date of default to 
when the debt charity first contacted them in March 2021. This is because Miss K 
wasnt in arrears on her account at all at that time, but only fell into arrears from the 
end of April onwards. And I feel that an important part of the default guidance issued 
by the ICO is that an account holder such as Miss K is given a fair opportunity to 
clear any arrears that develop on their account before that account is defaulted.
Finally, I also dont agree that it should have been apparent to PayPal that Miss K 
would necessarily have defaulted on her account upon being contacted by the debt 
charity in March 2021. This is because a persons financial position can improve 
unexpectedly over a short period of time. As such, Im satisfied that it was fair and 
reasonable for PayPal to follow the arrears process that they did, which was in 
accordance with the ICO guidance referenced above. And this includes that PayPal 
defaulted Miss Ks account in August 2021.All of which means that I dont feel that PayPal have done anything wrong or acted 
unfairly here, and it follows from this that my provisional decision is that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any further action.
Miss K responded to my provisional decision and reiterated that she felt it would be fair for 
PayPal to backdate the date of the default to when she they were first contacted by the debt 
charity on her behalf. And Miss K has explained how other creditors have backdated the 
default to an earlier date at her request. 
But its notable from a letter from another creditor that Miss K has provided, that the other 
creditor didnt feel it had made a mistake in how it had defaulted Miss Ks account, and the 
other creditor agreed to backdate the date of Miss Ks default as a gesture of goodwill. 
However, it remains the case that Miss K wasnt in arrears on her PayPal account when the 
debt charity first contacted PayPal. And I continue to feel that PayPal havent acted unfairly 
in how they administered the subsequent defaulting of Miss Ks account. As such, I dont feel 
it would be fair to instruct PayPal to backdate the date of default as Miss K would like, and I 
leave it at PayPals discretion as to whether theyre willing to backdate the date of default as 
a gesture of goodwill. 
Miss K also reiterated that she feels that she didnt miss any payments to PayPal. However, 
I feel that Ive addressed this point in my provisional decision letter, and my position on this 
point remains unchanged. 
I realise this wont be the outcome Miss K was wanting here, but it follows that my final 
decision will be that I wont be upholding her complaint. I hope Miss K will understand, given 
all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 August 2023.
