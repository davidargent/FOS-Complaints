The complaint
Mr Y complains that Santander UK plc wont refund to him the money that he paid for a 
holiday.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr Y used his Santander credit card in May 2017 to pay £3,393.44 and £169.50 to a 
travel company for a holiday for himself and two others that was to be taken in July 
2019  but he didnt have the correct visa so his holiday was cancelled;
he says that the travel company misreported the visa requirements to him and he 
claimed a refund of £3,562.94 from the travel company and then from Santander 
under the chargeback rules and section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 - but he 
wasnt satisfied with Santanders response so he complained to this service (and he's 
also complained about the customer service that he received from Santander);
our investigator said that Santander had raised a chargeback claim but she thought 
that its reasons for not taking it further were fair and reasonable  she said that it was 
Mr Ys responsibility to ensure that he was up to date on the visa requirements and 
that there hadnt been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday 
company  and she said that she was unable to see any evidence of Santander not 
communicating with Mr Y or providing him with poor service;
Mr Y has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and says that 
when he bought the holiday, the holiday company didnt give him key information 
about the visa requirements and provided incorrect information and that Santander 
did not comply with section 75;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Santander made a chargeback claim but it was defended by the holiday company 
because it said that he holiday was available to Mr Y but he was unable to use it 
because he didnt have the correct visa  on the basis of the information provided by 
the holiday company Santander decided not to proceed any further with the 
chargeback claim and Im not persuaded that it acted incorrectly in connection with 
Mr Ys chargeback claim;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ys complaint about Santander, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that Santanders response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ys claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the holiday companys information about 
visa requirements hadnt been properly updated  and Mr Y says that he relied on 
that information for his visa requirements;
the documents that were provided to Mr Y say, in a section about visa and entry 
requirements:  it is your responsibility to check the latest requirements with the 
appropriate authority before travelling  and a link to the governments website 
about foreign travel advice was included;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr Y to have done more to check the 
visa requirements before booking his holiday and I dont consider that it was fair or 
reasonable for him to rely solely on the information provided by the holiday company;
I dont consider that the incorrect information provided by the holiday company is 
enough to be a breach of contract or misrepresentation in these circumstances and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company;
I sympathise with Mr Y for the difficulties that hes experienced, but I consider that 
Santander has responded to his claim fairly and reasonably and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the customer service that hes received 
has fallen below a standard that it was reasonable for him to expect to receive; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Santander to refund to Mr Y any of the money that he paid for the holiday, to pay him 
any other compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ys complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
