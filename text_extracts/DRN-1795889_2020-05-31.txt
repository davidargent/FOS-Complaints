Complaint
Mr B has complained about TransferWise Ltd suspending his account and later closing it.
What happened
On 26 May 2019, someone set up a TransferWise account using very similar details to the 
one used for Mr Bs existing account. They asked for Mr Bs existing account to be closed.
TransferWise got in touch with Mr B to check if this was genuine. Mr B said it wasnt, so 
TransferWise put things on hold and referred the matter to a specialist team to look into. 
They assured Mr B that whatever happened, theyd get him his money back, and that if 
things checked out theyd be able to reactivate his account.
Over the next few days, Mr B sent TransferWise a number of messages insisting on a faster 
resolution, insulting staff members, and threatening to ruin the company.
On 31 May 2019, TransferWise reactivated Mr Bs account and offered him five free 
transfers as a goodwill gesture. They explained they had needed to look into things to make 
sure Mr Bs account, funds, and information were safe. They told Mr B that if he did not treat 
their staff better, theyd ask him to remove his funds and then theyd close his account. This 
was a final warning, following a prior warning when Mr B abused their staff in 2017.
Mr B wasnt happy with this. He said he wanted substantial compensation, and for 
TransferWise to publically post a personal apology to him on their social media. He sent 
further insults and threatened to spend every resource he had trying to ruin the company.
On 11 June 2019, Mr B withdrew his funds from the account, and TransferWise immediately 
closed it. They explained they wouldnt tolerate abuse. They reiterated that theyd previously 
suspended the account for security reasons.
Mr B came to our service. Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt 
uphold the complaint. He explained that TransferWise had acted within the terms and 
conditions of the account, and had already resolved things fairly. He thought it was 
reasonable for TransferWise to protect themselves from abuse, and noted that Mr B hadnt 
lost out by the accounts closure as hed been able to withdraw all his money beforehand.
Mr B didnt agree. He said the abusive communications were faked. He asked for his 
complaint to be looked at afresh, so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done that, Ive come to the same conclusions as our investigator, and for much the 
same reasons.I can understand it can be frustrating to have ones account put on hold. Here, someone set 
up an account using very similar details to Mr Bs, and asked for the old account to be 
closed. So TransferWise checked in with Mr B to make sure it was really him, and when he 
said it wasnt, they put the account on hold to review things and to keep Mr Bs funds and 
information safe. That seems reasonable to me. And the terms and conditions did allow 
TransferWise to suspend accounts for security reasons.
I can see that TransferWise kept Mr B updated about what was going on, and resolved the 
matter in a few days. That also seems reasonable. I do not find that they did anything 
substantially wrong there.
In regards to the account itself, TransferWise have closed it to protect their staff from abuse.
Mr B now says that his abusive communications with TransferWise have been faked. But 
some of the communications are from evidence that Mr B himself sent to us. Others, Mr B 
has previously admitted to making and has referred to in his correspondence. And the rest 
are written in his usual style and tone, and Ive got no evidence which shows that they were 
manufactured or tampered with in any way. Im satisfied that the record of Mr Bs contact 
with TransferWise is genuine.
In his contact with TransferWise, Mr B has referred to their staff using a variety of swear 
words, references to their parents, and other abusive terms that I won't reproduce in a 
published decision.
Under the terms and conditions Mr B agreed to, TransferWise can close his account without 
notice for abusive or harmful behaviour. I find that Mr Bs behaviour here qualifies as abusive 
and harmful, and so TransferWise were entitled to close his account in the way they did. 
I also find that they gave him more than sufficient warning.
Further, we look at things on a fair and reasonable basis. Setting the terms and conditions 
aside, I find that the way Mr B spoke to TransferWises staff was wholly unacceptable. And it 
is fair for TransferWise to protect their staff from abuse. So I think it is completely reasonable 
that TransferWise closed the account here.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
This final decision marks the end of our services consideration of the case.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 June 2020.
