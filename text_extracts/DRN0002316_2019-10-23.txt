K820x#14complaint
Mrs K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed her accounts. She 
says because of the block  on her accounts  she couldnt complete the purchase of a 
business. She wants NatWest to pay her compensation for her financial losses  and 
inconvenience caused by the block and closure of her accounts.
background
Mrs K had three bank  accounts with NatWest.
In October  2015, Mrs K sold two properties.  Mrs K says she intended to use the profit from 
the house sales to buy a business. And the deal to buy the business was meant  to complete 
on 11 April 2016.
The proceeds of the house sales were deposited into an account Mrs K held with another 
bank, which  I will refer to as bank  B. In early December 2015, Mrs K made several  transfers 
totalling around £300,000  from bank B into one of her NatWest accounts.
In late March 2016, NatWest reviewed  Mrs Ks accounts. Whilst it completed its review it 
blocked Mrs Ks accounts and asked her to provide proof of her entitlement to the money 
shed deposited  into her account in December 2015.  In response Mrs K provided NatWest 
with copies of her bank  accounts with bank B. NatWest said this wasnt  enough and asked 
for more documentation.  Mrs K then supplied paperwork from solicitors and estate agents to 
show shed sold two houses. And that the money  in her account was from the proceeds  of 
these sales.
As a result of its review, NatWest decided to close Mrs Ks accounts. And on 5 April 2016 it 
wrote to Mrs K to let her know she needed  to make alternative banking  arrangements. 
NatWest then completed its review and released the funds in Mrs Ks accounts to her on 12 
April 2016. Mrs K says NatWest took too long to release the money in her account. As a 
result, she says she lost out on buying a business  and profits which  shed anticipated 
making from the business,  which she estimates  to be in excess of £150,000. Mrs K wants  
NatWest to compensate  her for the money  she says she is out of pocket and the stress 
shes suffered.
An investigator looked into Mrs Ks complaint. He said NatWest  acted in line with its legal 
and regulatory  obligations when it asked  Mrs K for more information about  the payments into 
her account.  And it hadnt done anything  wrong when it closed Mrs Ks accounts. So, he 
didnt uphold  the complaint. Mrs K disagreed. She said NatWest had no good reason to 
block and close her accounts. 
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN00023162I can appreciate that Mrs K was caused  distress  and inconvenience  by what  happened.  But 
the issue here is whether NatWest acted fairly in placing a block on Mrs Ks accounts and 
whether the length of time it took to undertake  its internal  review  was reasonable.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review  of Mrs Ks accounts. Anti-money 
laundering regulations and UK legislation place extensive obligations on regulated  financial 
businesses to have  suitable systems in place for customer identification. Financial 
institutions must establish the purpose  and intended  nature of a business as well as the 
origin of funds, and there may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and 
existing relationships.
In order to meet these  requirements NatWest is entitled to ask a customer for more  
information about how they use their account. And its not for this service to interfere  with the 
banks processes. Our role is to see if the bank has made any mistakes and then put the 
customer back in the position theyd have  been  in if the mistake hadnt happened.
The terms and conditions  that apply to Mrs Ks accounts outline the circumstances in which 
NatWest can block  an account. Having considered those  terms carefully  Im satisfied 
NatWest acted in line with them. But any account  review should be completed in a timely  
manner. I note that NatWest asked  Mrs K to provide more information  and she did this on 5 
April 2016. I can see that NatWest completed  its enquiries with Bank B on 11 April 2016  and 
removed the block from the account on the same  day. Mrs K funds were released  to her the 
following day. So overall, Im satisfied that the review  was completed in a timely manner.
I understand that Mrs K wants NatWest to explain  the reason  it applied the blocks to her 
accounts. But NatWest  doesnt disclose to its customers what  triggers a review of their 
accounts. Its under no obligation to tell Mrs K the reasons behind the account review  and 
block, as much as shed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything  wrong  by not giving 
Mrs K this information. 
Overall, having looked  at all the evidence and circumstances  of this complaint, Im satisfied 
that NatWest acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the accounts.  And in line 
with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked Mrs Ks accounts and asked her to 
provide information  about how she was using the account. So, I cant say NatWest  has done 
anything wrong. And Im not going  to ask NatWest  to compensate Mrs K for any distress, 
inconvenience or financial loss this may have caused her.
account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mrs K had to comply  
with  say that it could  close  the account by giving her 60 days  notice. And sooner  in certain 
circumstances. NatWest  has done this. So, its entitled to close the account as it seems  its 
already done.  In other words,  there  has been no breach of contract, as Mrs K has 
suggested, because  NatWest has acted in accordance with the account terms and 
conditions.
I know Mrs K is frustrated  that she hasnt been  given a proper explanation why her accounts 
were closed. But under the terms and conditions NatWest doesnt  have  to give a reason for 
Ref: DRN00023163doing so  in the same  way a customer doesnt have to, should they no longer want to bank 
with them.  So, I cant say NatWest has done  anything wrong by not giving Mrs K this 
information.
Mrs K says NatWest didnt let her know it was closing her accounts. And she only received a 
copy of the notice to closure letter in 2018. I disagree. NatWest has provided screens shots 
to show that the letter  was sent to Mrs K on 5 April 2016. I can also see from looking at 
NatWests contact notes  dated  11 April 2016,  that Mrs K seems to have  known NatWest  
were closing her account. And was trying  to find out when the money in her account would 
be released. I dont think  she wouldve been making  this enquiry had she not received 
NatWests letter. So, I think its likely Mrs K did receive NatWests  notice  to closure  letter. 
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mrs K feels about whats happened,  and I dont doubt  
it was a frustrating time. But overall, based  on the evidence I have, I cant  fairly  say NatWest 
have acted unreasonably. So, I wont be asking them to do anything.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 November  2019.
