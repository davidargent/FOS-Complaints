K822xcomplaint
Mr P has complained that NewDay Ltd didnt carry out adequate affordability checks  when it 
gave him a credit card and increased the credit limit a number of times. Hes also unhappy  
that NewDay refused  to freeze and refund interest. 
background 
NewDay first gave  Mr P the credit  card in 2008. There were three credit limit increases: in 
2010, 2013 and 2014 respectively. 
In 2018 NewDay  issued Mr P with a default notice,  terminated the account and registered 
the default with credit  reference agencies. Mr P was left owing the balance on his account. 
NewDay has only consented  to the ombudsman service investigating events that took place 
in the last six years. This means we havent  looked into the original issue of the credit card 
or the 2010 credit limit increase. There was no unknown or concealed information about  
those matters that only came to light in the last three  years.  
Our adjudicator concluded there  were  no reasonable grounds for her to criticise NewDays 
decision to offer increases of the credit limit in 2013 and 2014. But she also concluded  
NewDay should have  defaulted Mr Ps account  earlier than it did. So NewDay should adjust 
the default date and refund interest  and charges for the relevant period.  
NewDay didnt accept  the adjudicators conclusions. It thought they were  an unwarranted 
interference in its policies  and decision-making.  NewDay said it was its policy  to allow  a 
customer in arrears time to pay before it moved to default. It also said (a) the guidance of the 
Information Commissioner wasnt prescriptive, it was ultimately  for NewDay to decide what 
action it took regarding accounts  in arrears and (b) it was NewDays  policy  to charge interest  
and levy charges  until the default was registered.  
Mr P neither  expressly accepted the adjudicators conclusions nor challenged them. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Im sorry to disappoint NewDay but Ive 
reached the same conclusions as the adjudicator and for largely similar reasons. 
It isnt the case  nor perhaps is NewDay actually suggesting  that NewDays actions or 
even its policies or commercial decisions fall outside the scope of an ombudsmans  
investigation. But whats always  the case is that the ombudsman  service will look into how 
those matters have  impacted  on an individual consumer  in a fact-specific way. We dont rule 
on policies in the abstract.
What caused  both the adjudicator and me concern about the facts of Mr Ps case is the 
protracted nature of the default  process  that NewDay  employed. The default  notice was 
issued in late July 2018 but it wasnt until late December  2018 that the default  was 
registered. Meanwhile interest and, for most of the time, charges continued to be applied  to 
Mr Ps account. 
Ref: DRN79984592Even if this reasoning  is accepted, I appreciate its then debatable what date the default 
should be treated  as effective from (which in normal circumstances  would be the date of the 
decision to register it). 
Ive given this careful  consideration.  Ive kept in mind that while  the effective date of the 
default is important,  Im also deciding the cut-off date for further interest and charges, and 
that the issue of overall fairness is engaged. Like the adjudicator, I think  its relevant to 
consider the history of the arrears on the account. Bearing this in mind and exercising my 
judgement, Ive decided that the start of June 2018,  as the adjudicator  also recommended, is 
a fair result. 
I too have concluded NewDay could reasonably offer Mr P the credit limit increases in 2013 
and 2014. Ive nothing to add to the reasons the adjudicator gave. 
my final decision
I require NewDay Ltd to adjust Mr Ps account  and the balance  owing  under  it so that all 
interest and charges added to it after 31 May 2018 are treated as if they hadnt  been added. 
NewDay Ltd should also amend Mr Ps credit file and notify  the relevant agencies  that the 
default date was 1 June  2018. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2020.
