The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that Madison CF Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, took a payment from 
his account that shouldnt have been taken at that time.
What happened
Mr S agreed to make a payment of £443.22 to 118 118 on 5 August 2022 to clear the 
balance on his 118 118 credit account. Mr S was told that there would still be a balance 
outstanding on his account following that payment, and so he asked for the 5 August 2022 
agreed payment to be cancelled and for the full balance on his account to be taken on 19 
August 2022, by which time he would receive additional money to pay the larger amount.
However, on 5 August 2022, Mr S noticed that 118 118 had taken the £443.22 theyd agreed 
not to take. 118 118 apologised for their error and explained theyd reimburse the £443.22 
back to Mr Ss account within two working days. But 118 118 didnt reimburse the money 
within two days as they said they would, which meant that Mr S had to call and request the 
return of the money again. Mr S did then receive the 443.22 back from 118 118 on 10 
August 2022. But he wasnt happy about what had happened, and so he raised a complaint.
118 118 looked at Mr Ss complaint. They apologised for not cancelling the 5 August 2022 
payment as they should have done and made a payment of £50 to Mr S as compensation for 
any upset and trouble he may have incurred. 118 118 also offered to reimburse any fees or 
charges Mr S may have incurred because of the £443.22 not being present in his bank for 
the time it wasnt, so long as Mr S could evidence any such charges or fees. Mr S wasnt 
satisfied with 118 118s response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt the response 118 118 had 
issued to Mr Ss complaint already represented a fair resolution to what had happened. Mr S 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law, which means that it isnt within the 
remit of this service to fine or punish a business, or to declare that a business has acted in 
a non-regulatory or unlaw way. Such declarations would be for a regulatory body or a Court 
of Law to potentially make. Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution 
service with a remit thats focussed on fairness of outcome. 
This means that, in instances where a business acknowledges it made an error, the remit of 
this service centres around ensuring that the business takes any necessary corrective action 
to put the complainant back into the position they should reasonably be in  had the error 
never occurred  and to consider any compensation offered by the business and to instruct 
either new or further compensation if its felt to be fair and reasonable to do so. 
In this instance, 118 118 dont dispute that they shouldnt have taken the £443.22 on 5 
August 2022 as they did, and theyve apologised to Mr S for this and reimbursed the money 
back to him  which they did five days later, on 10 August 2022. As such, Im satisfied that 
118 118 have already taken the corrective action necessary to put Mr S back into the 
position he should have been, had the money not been taken by them on 5 August 2022. 
But it seems clear that Mr S was unfairly upset and inconvenienced by what took place here. 
To that effect, 118 118 have made a payment of £50 to him as compensation for any upset 
or trouble the incorrect taking of the £443.22 may have caused. And theyve also offered to 
reimburse any charges or fees Mr S may have incurred as a result of their error.
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered fair by one person often 
not considered as such by someone else. But given the full circumstances of this complaint, 
I do feel the £50 compensation already paid to Mr S by 118 118 is already a fair amount for 
the impact that 118 118s mistake had on him, and I can confirm its commensurate with 
what I might have instructed 118 118 to pay, had they not already done so.
In arriving at this position, Ive considered the relatively short time the money was absent 
form Mr Ss account, as well as that Mr S had to contact 118 118 on more than one occasion 
to request the reimbursement of that money. And Ive also considered the general 
framework which this service uses when considering compensation amounts for trouble and 
upset incurred  further information about which can be found on this services website. 
Finally, Ive also considered that 118 118 have offered to reimburse any charges or fees that 
Mr S may have incurred because of the £443.22 not being present in his account for the 
days that it wasnt. This feels fair to me, and in consideration of all these points I feel the 
response that 118 118 have already issued to Mr S does represent a fair outcome to what 
took place. This isnt to discredit the upset and frustration Mr S has experienced because of 
what happened here, but only to say, from an impartial perspective, that I feel 118 118 have 
already done enough to rectify that position and to compensate Mr S for what happened.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr S was wanting, but it follows that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing 118 118 to take any further action. I hope that Mr S will 
understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision here that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2023.
