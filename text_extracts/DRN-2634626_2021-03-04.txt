The complaint
 Miss G complains about logbook loans provided to her by Greenlight Credit Ltd, (trading as 
Varooma) which she says were unaffordable.
 
What happened
  Varooma provided Miss G with log book loans. These loans were granted on the basis 
that Miss G provided Varooma with a bill of sale for her car. This meant that if Miss G didnt 
make her loan repayments, Varooma could potentially recoup its losses through the sale of 
the vehicle. 
Our adjudicator looked into whether 4 loans were given to Miss G fairly. The details are as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Months Monthly amount Repayment date
1 05.03.2014 £1200 9 £213.33 04/11/2014
2 04.11.2014 £1000 6 £237.50 13/05/2015
3 13.05.2015 £1400 12 £198.33 05/01/2016
4 05.01.2016 £1500 12 £206.25 06/02/2016
Miss G made her repayments on time on each of her 4 loans. She repaid loan 1, 3 and 
4 early. She requested a new loan on the same day she repaid loan 1, 2 and 3. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Miss Gs complaint. He wrote to both parties and 
explained why he thought Varooma didnt provide proportionate checks for loans 3 and 
4. He concluded that if it had done so, it wouldnt have provided these 2 loans. 
Varooma disagreed and said it carried out proportionate checks when it agreed to loan 
4. It did offer to provide compensation on loan 3. Our adjudicator put this offer to Miss 
G, but she turned it down. The complaint was then passed to me.
I issued a provisional decision on 28 January 2021 upholding Miss Gs complaint. Within the 
decision I made the following findings:
I didnt look into loans 1 and 2 as Miss G agreed with the adjudicator that Varooma 
didnt need to carry out further checks when it agreed them.
I concluded Varooma should have done more when it agreed to loan 3. I said it 
needed to carry out further checks that it had done at the time.
When I looked into what Varooma would most likely have seen if it had carried out 
sufficient checks, I saw that Miss G was struggling to manage her finances. She had 
taken out a significant number of loans at the time and I felt this showed she had a 
reliance of short-term credit. 
I concluded she shouldnt have been given loan 3 or loan 4 either as her situation 
hadnt improved by then.
I also felt that by the time Miss G had asked for loan 4, a pattern of lending had 
developed where Miss Gs borrowing was unsustainable and Varooma ought to have 
known this.
Because of this I upheld Miss Gs complaint about loans 3 and 4. I then asked both 
parties for comments by 27 February 2021.
Both parties have confirmed they received my provisional decision. 
Miss G responded on 28 January 2021 and has nothing further to add.
Varooma responded on 15 February 2021 and also has nothing to add. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 As both parties do not have any further points to raise, I do not need to depart from my 
findings given within my provisional decision.
In conclusion, for the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I uphold Miss Gs 
complaint.
Putting things right
I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Miss Gs complaint for 
Varooma to put things right by:
adding up the total amount of money Miss G received as a result of being given 
loans 3 and 4. The payments Miss G made should be deducted from this 
amount. Any payments made after the total repaid exceeds the amount Miss G 
was given should be treated as overpayments and refunded to her;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments from the date they 
were paid by Miss G to the date of settlement;
removing any adverse information placed on Miss Gs credit file because of loan 
3;
Remove all information about Loan 4 from Miss Gs credit file. By this point, 
information recorded about further borrowing was likely to be adverse.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Varooma to take off tax from this interest. Varooma must 
give Miss G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one
  
My final decision  I uphold this complaint and direct Greenlight Credit Ltd to pay Miss G fair compensation in 
accordance with the above calculation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
