Mr C says that adequate affordability checks werent  carried out before the loans were  
provided and that had these taken place Lending Stream would have realised  that he had 
multiple loans with different lenders. He says he fell into a cycle of debt borrowing from one 
lender to repay another  and that following  the loans he needed to go into a debt 
management plan.
 
Lending Stream says that before lending to Mr C it carried out rigorous affordability checks. 
It says it doesnt offer payday loans where the full amount is due within 30 days nor does it 
offer rollovers. It says its loans are monthly  instalment  loans allowing repayment  over a 
longer period of time. It says that before providing the loans, Mr Cs income and expenses 
information was gathered  and based  on this the repayments were  affordable.
Our adjudicator thought that the loans should be considered as two separate lending  chains: 
the first chain containing loans one to six; and the second containing loans seven to 13. She 
said she didnt have  enough evidence to say that loans one to five in the first chain shouldnt 
have been provided but that by loan six, Lending Stream  should  have seen that Mr Cs 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested he was persistently reliant on short term borrowing.  
In regard to the second lending chain, our adjudicator thought  that by loan nine Lending 
Stream should have  had concerns that Mr C was struggling to manage his money  and was 
unlikely to be able to sustainably repay this, and subsequent loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  that Lending Stream refund the interest and charges on loans 
six and loans nine to 13 and that amendments were made to Mr Cs credit file in regard to 
these loans.
Ref: DRN20765002Lending Stream accepted our adjudicators view. It noted that certain loan accounts had 
been transferred  to another company. It said it had contacted the company and been told 
that no payments  had been made and said it would be in a position to buy back  the loans if 
the accounts werent closed. It also said that there was an outstanding principal balance of 
£720 against which it would offset  the refund due to Mr C. It said this resulted in Mr C owing 
it £70.44. It said f Mr C was struggling  to repay  this outstanding balance he should contact it 
to discuss a payment  arrangement. 
Mr C didnt accept our adjudicators view and so the complaint has been passed  to me, an 
ombudsman, to issue a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer.  These factors  
include:
the lower  a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Mr C could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
Ref: DRN20765003repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
The early  loans in this case were provided  before CONC.  At that time the relevant  guidance  
was provided by the Office of Fair trading (OFT) and this also set out the need to make  a 
reasonable assessment of whether a borrower  can afford to meet repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Having looked  at the timing of the loans I agree that they should be considered as two 
separate lending chains.  The first lending chain includes  loans one to six and the remaining 
loans, which  were taken  out after a gap of over a year, form the second lending chain. 
Considering the first lending chain, I agree without adjudicator that there  isnt enough to say 
that loans one to five shouldnt have been provided. However by loan six I think Lending  
Stream should have  seen that Mr Cs pattern of borrowing  suggested he had become 
persistently reliant  on short term borrowing. 
Mr C repaid his sixth loan in March 2014  and didnt  then take out another  loan until August 
2015. This loan,  loan seven, was the first in the new lending chain and I agree with our 
adjudicator that there isnt enough to say this loan shouldnt  have  been  provided. Likewise I 
believe this to be true in regard to loan eight.
However, when loan nine was taken  out, Mr C still hadnt repaid loans seven or eight. Given  
this I think that Lending  Stream should have been  concerned that Mr C was experiencing 
issues manging his money and that lending to him at this time wasnt  sustainably affordable.
Mr C did repay loans  seven to nine before he took out his tenth loan. However, given his 
previous pattern of borrowing I think it would have been reasonable that further checks were 
carried out to ensure  lending to Mr C was affordable. Had this happened I think  Lending 
Stream would have  realised that Mr C was making  payments to a debt management plan 
and making use of other short  term loan providers. Given this I think that Lending  Stream  
would have realised  lending to him at this stage  wasnt  sustainable.
By loan twelve, Mr Cs overall pattern of borrowing suggested he was dependent on short 
term loans.
Overall, I agree  with our adjudicator that loans six and loans nine to 13 shouldnt have been 
provided. I note Lending  Stream has accepted this.
I note the comments Lending Stream has made about taking back the loans that have been 
passed to a third party  and also about  the outstanding  principal amount due. While I find that 
certain loans shouldnt have been provided,  as Mr C had the benefit of the money lent it is 
fair he is required to pay this back.  Therefore  I find it reasonable that the refund required 
under this decision can be offset against  the outstanding principal amount.
Ref: DRN20765004my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Gain Credit  LLC (trading as Lending  Stream)  
should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr C paid on loan six, and loans nine to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  from Mr Cs credit file relating to loans nine to 11;
the number  of loans taken at loan six and loans 12 to 13 means any information  
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about these loans should be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Gain Credit  LLC (trading as Lending Stream)  to take off 
tax from this interest. Gain Credit LLC (trading  as Lending Stream) must give Mr C a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr C didnt repay all his loans to Lending stream  and his outstanding  loan accounts  have 
been transferred  to a third party company. Lending Stream has said that payments havent 
been made to the third party company and that it can take back the loans. It seems 
reasonable that if Mr C still owes the capital he borrowed that the refund due to him should 
be used to reduce  that debt. Lending Stream  must first take the debt back into its own books 
and reduce it to reflect  just the capital that Mr C borrowed less any repayments he has 
made. If Lending Stream is unable to do this it must  ensure that its interest  and charges, and 
any other interest and charges added by the third party company, are refunded  to Mr C so 
he can choose whether to use the compensation to settle his debt directly.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 October  2019.
