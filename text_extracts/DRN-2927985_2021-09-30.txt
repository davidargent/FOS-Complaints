The complaint
Ms B and Mr W complain that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays 
Partner Finance, has rejected the claims that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Their complaint is being dealt with by their representative.
What happened
Ms B and Mr W entered into an agreement to buy a timeshare membership in June 2011 
and Mr W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for 
the timeshare at the same time. Their representative made a claim to Barclays Partner 
Finance in April 2020 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act that the 
timeshare had been mis-sold to them. 
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by June 2020 
so a complaint was made to this service. Barclays Partner Finance has since said that their 
claims are time barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Our investigator didnt recommend that 
this complaint should be upheld. She said that Mr Ws claim was more than likely time 
barred under the Limitation Act so she thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not 
to look into the claim was fair. 
Ms B and Mr Ws representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
the limitation period for simple claims in contract is six years from the date of the 
breach of contract and the date of the breach was some time after the date of the 
contract, when the timeshare company failed to deliver what it had promised to the 
consumer at the time of sale  so it denies that Ms B and Mr Ws claim under section 
75 is time barred;
where a claimant seeks to re-open a credit bargain on the grounds that the 
relationship between the lender and the creditor is unfair within section 140A, the 
action is a speciality for the purposes of section 8 of the Limitation Act 1980 and the 
relevant limitation period is twelve years;
it has been held that, where the relationship between the creditor and the debtor has 
ended, the determination of unfairness should be made as at the date when the 
relationship ended and it understands that the loan wasnt paid off until November 
2014 so the twelve-year limitation period will not expire until November 2026; and
liability for the untruthful statements made by the timeshare companys sales 
representatives at the point of sale can be attributed to Barclays Partner Finance 
under section 56(2) of the Consumer Credit Act and are to be taken into account for 
Ms B and Mr Ws claim under section 140A.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
I accept that Ms B and Mr W referred their complaint to our service within six years of 
the event complained of  which is Barclays Partner Finance turning down their 
claims under the Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether it has acted 
fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to their claims;
Ms B and Mr Ws claims are under sections 75 and 140A  in this decision Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be able to do that but 
Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims 
was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Ms B and Mr Ws claim to Barclays Partner Finance under section 75 is that the 
timeshare was misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to them  their representative has said in response to 
our investigators recommendations that theres also been a breach of contract by the 
timeshare company  but that didnt form part of their claim to Barclays Partner 
Finance so Im unable to consider it in this complaint (if they want to complain about 
a breach of contract they should first make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance and 
then, if theyre not satisfied with its response, they may be able to make a separate 
complaint to this service);
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Ms B and Mr W could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that induced them into buying 
the timeshare when they entered into the agreement to buy the timeshare in June 
2011 as that was when they entered into an agreement based on the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as Mr W entered 
into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but they didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
April 2020, nearly nine years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act;Ms B and Mr Ws representative says that there was an unfair relationship between 
Ms B and Mr W and Barclays Partner Finance and that liability for the untruthful 
statements made by the timeshare companys sales representatives should be taken 
into account for Ms B and Mr Ws claim under section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made);
Ms B and Mr Ws representative says that their claim under section 140A is a 
specialty so section 8 of the Limitation Act applies and the limitation period is twelve 
years - it has referred me to a case that deals with this point and in that case it was 
held that a claim under a similar provision to section 140A was a specialty, and so 
section 8 applied unless the claim was for the repayment of money previously paid 
under the agreement in which case section 9 applied and the limitation period was 
six years - applying that judgment to the facts of Ms B and Mr Ws case, they are 
seeking the repayment of monies that Mr W paid under the loan agreement, so I 
consider that the six year limitation period applies;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr W entered into the loan agreement in June 
2011 and its provided an account summary showing that the loan was repaid in 
November 2012  Ms B and Mr Ws representative says that it understands that the 
loan was paid off in November 2014 but Ive seen no other evidence to support that 
so I consider it to be more likely than not that the loan ended in November 2012;
Ms B and Mr W would have needed to make a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance within six years of the loan ending in November 2012  but they didnt make 
a claim to it until April 2020, more than seven years later, which was outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Ms B and Mr Ws 
claims by June 2020 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it 
should have assessed their claims under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so 
I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to their claims  but I 
consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as 
it would have said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the 
Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Ms B and Mr W for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to them any of the money that Mr W paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms B and Mr Ws complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B and Mr W to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
