The complaint
A, a limited company, complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc has dealt with 
the repayment plan for its loan. Mr F, a director, brings this complaint on behalf of A.
What happened
Mr F said that A had previously complained to our service about its loan, some years ago.
He said we had agreed that a payment plan should be set up, and no interest charged until
the loan was paid off. But Mr F said that NatWest was over-reporting the balance of the loan
by Â£9,617. That was partly because it had added some money to the loan, and partly
because it had failed to credit recent payments towards the loan. Mr F said NatWest had
also sold the account on to a third party. He wanted it to take the loan back.
Mr F said NatWest had sent letters to him and another director at home, making it seem as if
they were personally liable for the debt.
NatWest said that Mr F and his fellow director had given personal guarantees for this debt,
so they were personally liable. But it wasnt asking them to repay.
NatWest accepted that the amount it was asking for in these letters wasnt right. It said that
letters were automatically populated with the account balance, which was inaccurate in this
case because NatWest is manually calculating how much A owes. It said it had recently
issued a statement of liability, and the balance shown on that document was accurate. It said
it would pass this total on to the company that now owns the debt.
NatWest said it had made a commercial decision to sell the debt, in line with its policy. It said
that decision wasnt based on the repayment of the debt. It said the payments that Mr F had
made to it would be passed over to the company that now owned the debt. And it asked
Mr F to talk to the agency now charged with collecting the debt about the balance of the loan
in future.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that the sale of the
loan was something that NatWest was entitled to do under the terms of As agreement with
it. And our investigator couldnt see any detriment to A as a result of the sale. She said
NatWest has explained that the two directors gave personal guarantees for the loan, and
that when it wrote to the directors, the business and guarantor accounts had already been
sold, so NatWest was only able to send correspondence to their personal address. Our
investigator didnt think that was unreasonable.
Mr F says he wanted NatWest to write off As debt, remove any adverse data recorded on
his credit file and that of the other director, and pay compensation. But our investigator didnt
think NatWest needed to do any more. NatWest had said it doesnt record any information
about a limited companys account on a personal credit file, so it has no adverse information
to remove from the directors credit files. And, although she agreed NatWest did have an
incorrect balance recorded for the loan, it had amended this. Our investigator said she
couldnt see that this had caused any detriment. And even if it had she wouldnt be able to
award compensation for distress and inconvenience. A is a company, it cant suffer distress
and it hasnt been inconvenienced. So she didnt think NatWest had to do any more.
Mr F said he would send in the final decision hed received for As earlier complaint, in 2013.
He thought that by selling this debt, NatWest wasnt complying with that decision. Mr F said
the debt collection agency was now demanding repayment. But our investigator said that this
was probably because Mr F had continued to pay NatWest, rather than starting to pay the
agency which was now responsible for the debt.
Mr F has since confirmed that the debt collection agency has been given a reduced balance.
He said the adjustment clearly told him that NatWest didnt study this case fairly, but placed
it in a block with all its debtors and wrongly made the assumption that A wasnt going to be
able to pay this. He said he was still considering legal action on behalf of A, and wanted
NatWest to write off the debt to avoid that. He said he intended to continue paying NatWest
for this debt, but then NatWest closed the account he was paying into, and he was forced to
start paying the debt collection agency.
Mr F wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a
final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
Mr F said NatWest had written to his personal address, and that of the other director, 
to tell them about the sale. He thought NatWest shouldve written to the company, 
and he said this meant that he and the other director were concerned they were 
becoming personally liable for the debt. He was also concerned that NatWest had 
recorded adverse information on his personal credit file and that of the other director, 
although NatWest says it doesnt do this.
I think it would help if I clarify that I cant consider a complaint about issues personal 
to Mr F, or to the other director, as part of a case brought by a company. Our service 
can make a separate decision on those areas if Mr F would like.
I can only consider the impact on the company. And I dont think that A was 
disadvantaged by NatWest writing to its directors at their home address.
Mr F told us that NatWest has sold As debt to a third party, which is using a debt 
collection agency to get the money back. He says that breaches a decision our 
service had previously issued. I dont know if it does or not, because I dont have this 
decision. I havent been able to locate it here, and Mr F hasnt sent it to us. So I make 
no finding on this point, including on whether our service would have jurisdiction to 
consider it.
Mr F says that NatWest made a serious mistake when it sold the debt, because A 
had almost finished repaying it. But NatWest said it sold this debt as part of its overall 
business policies. It has told us that this had nothing to do with how A was paying off 
the debt.
Its not unusual to see a bank sell off older debts to a collection company. And 
NatWest has shown us it has the right to do this under the terms of its agreement 
with A. Although I know Mr F wants NatWest to take this debt back in house, I 
havent been able to identify any serious disadvantage faced by A, in paying this debt 
to a third party. I dont think that NatWest has to buy this debt back.Mr F has also pointed out that NatWest gave the third party who bought this debt the 
wrong balance. I can see that it has taken some time to put this right, but I think thats 
also because Mr F continued to direct payments towards As loan to NatWest, after 
the debt had been sold. That meant NatWest had to forward that money to the third 
party, and it caused a delay in updating the balance of this account. I understand this 
has now been put right, and Mr F is making payments to the collection agency 
appointed on behalf of the new owner of this debt. 
I know that Mr F feels strongly about this issue, but on the evidence Ive seen so far, I 
dont think that NatWest has disadvantaged A by selling this debt. It did need to 
correct the amount that A owes, but I understand that it has done that. So I dont 
think NatWest has to do any more to put this right.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr F sent a substantive reply. NatWest said it had nothing to add.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F set out for us what he said the content of the previous decision was. He said that 
decision had upheld As argument, that the loan shouldnt have been defaulted as A had 
agreed to pay. He said that unfortunately, once that had happened it couldnt be reversed. 
So it was agreed that all charges and interest on the loan would cease, and A would pay off 
the debt in instalments. Mr F said it was also agreed that this debt would stay with NatWest 
as long as payments were maintained. Mr F didnt forward this decision to us. 
It wouldnt be appropriate for me to comment here on a previous decision by our service, 
especially as I havent seen this myself. Final decisions of our service which have been 
accepted by the complainant may be enforced through the courts. Mr F may wish to seek 
further advice for A on whether this would be an appropriate route in this case.
Mr F said Id referred to NatWest over-reporting the loan, and said this was partly because 
NatWest had added some money to the loan, and partly because it had failed to credit 
recent payments towards the loan. Mr F said that the over-reporting was 99% due to money 
NatWest added. He said that repayments made to As account were passed over to the debt 
collection agency within three days. 
Mr F said that A had found it difficult to contest the amount of the loan, as both NatWest and 
the agency were unhelpful. Fortunately A had kept its own records.
I note what Mr F has said about the over-reporting. I understand that this issue has been 
resolved, and I can see that NatWest apologised for this in its letter of 13 July 2020. I think 
thats a fair resolution to this part of As complaint.
Mr F said he wanted to know why NatWest had suddenly started writing to him and another 
director at home, when no other correspondence has ever been sent there. 
NatWest has said this was done because Mr F and the other director had given personal 
guarantees for the debt. It wasnt asking them to repay the debt. I think its fair for NatWest 
to take steps to notify directors when a change happens to a debt they have guaranteed.Mr F said A had never received any reply from NatWest containing the details Id set out in 
my decision (that it was a purely commercial decision to sell the debt). He also said it hadnt 
returned any of his calls or email messages.
I can see that NatWests response to Mr Fs complaint was sent by email on 13 July 2020. It 
appears to have been sent to the email address that Mr F gave our service. So I do think this 
was sent by NatWest. If this has not arrived safely, or has been misplaced since, our service 
can forward this to Mr F.
On the broader point that NatWest has now stopped direct communications with Mr F, a lot 
of businesses do prefer not to communicate directly with a complainant while a complaint is 
being considered by our service. Things can get very confused if there are several different 
lines of communication open. I dont think it would be inappropriate here for NatWest to take 
that approach.
Mr F said NatWest still needed to explain why it had changed things now, with only a year 
left on the debt. 
NatWest has said the decision to sell this debt was a purely commercial decision. I noted in 
my provisional decision that this is not an uncommon thing for businesses to do with older 
debts, and it shouldnt be taken as a sign that NatWest had any concerns about the conduct 
of this debt by A.
Mr F said NatWest shouldnt have forced A over the last two months to pay the debt 
collection agency. He understood that while an investigation is going on, until a final decision 
is made, NatWest was not supposed to do anything. 
NatWest had already sold this debt, before Mr F brought As complaint to our service. If 
NatWest then asked A to pay the agency thats currently managing the debt, that wouldnt 
reflect a change that happened during our investigation, it would reflect the position before 
our service was asked to look at this. Again, I dont think that would be inappropriate.
Mr F said that A intends to seek further legal advice on this matter. He said NatWest has
made changes to the account without any discussion and the directors feel this is unfair.
I set out in my provisional decision that I havent been able to see that selling this debt has 
caused any detriment to A. And I havent seen anything to make me think that NatWest 
needed to discuss this debt sale with A before it was done. So I dont think that what 
NatWest has done is unfair. 
I know Mr F will be disappointed, but I still dont think As complaint should be upheld. Its a 
matter for Mr F to decide whether he would now like to take further legal advice on this issue 
for A. I note only that if this decision is rejected by A, then neither A nor NatWest will be 
bound by it.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
