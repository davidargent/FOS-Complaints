K820x#14complaint
Mr L says Bank of Scotland plc (BofS) mis-sold  him a payment protection  insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
background
This complaint is about a credit  card PPI policy taken out in 2001.  The policy was added  to 
Mr Ls credit  card account when he applied for the card by post. 
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.  Mr L disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ls case. 
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ls complaint because:
I think BofS made Mr L aware  that the PPI was optional and that he chose to take it  
although I can understand why he can no longer  remember  this. Ive looked at his 
card application  form and Mr L has signed it specifically to confirm he wanted PPI.
BofS didnt  recommend the PPI to Mr L so it didnt have to check if it was suitable for 
him. 
Its possible the information BofS gave  Mr L about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
should have been.  But Mr L chose to take out the policy  and so appears to have 
wanted this type of cover.  He was not affected by any of the exclusions or limitations 
and the policy was competitively priced  and apparently affordable.  So I think  it 
unlikely Mr L would  have  made a different decision if better information had been 
provided. On balance I think he would still have taken out the policy.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 June  2019.
