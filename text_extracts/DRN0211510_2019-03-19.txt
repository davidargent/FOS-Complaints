Mr L complains  that Black  Horse Limiteds (Black Horse) administration  of his Hire 
Purchase (HP) agreement has caused him both a loss, and trouble and upset,  and he 
should be fairly compensated for this.
background 
Mr L entered into a HP agreement with Black  Horse in May 2012. Mr Ls liability under this 
agreement was deemed settled in full by Black Horse in November 2016.
During the course of Mr Ls agreement, the following charges were debited:
11 January 2013 £50.00 
7 May 2015 £326.00
7 May 2015 £40.72 
7 May 2015 £206.38 
Total £623.10 
In August  2018  Black Horse wrote  to Mr L. It said that following a review of his agreement it 
was refunding the £623.10 worth of charges  it had debited  plus interest (on this sum) of 
£143.77.
On receipt of the above, being  £766.87,  Mr L complained to Black  Horse that it should have 
to pay him more. However Black Horse disagreed and Mr L referred his complaint to our 
service for investigation.
Mr Ls complaint was considered by one of our investigators.  In summary she concluded  that 
£766.87 was, in all the circumstances, a fair and reasonable sum for Black Horse  to have 
paid.
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators  conclusion  so his complaint  has been passed  to me 
for review and decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. And having  done so, I can confirm  that 
Ive come to the same  overall  conclusions as the investigator and for broadly the same  
reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what  has already been said.
I appreciate Black Horse  made the refund  (with interest)  that it did following discussions with 
the regulator. But Im not persuaded that these  charges, having had regard to the agreement 
Mr L signed and what both parties  have said and submitted, were incorrectly,  unfairly or 
unreasonably debited.
I might  have  also expected Mr L to have raised  his concerns about the charges he incurred, 
if he felt they were unfair or unreasonable and that they were causing him trouble  and upset, 
at the time he incurred  them (2013  and 2015)  rather than in 2018.
Ref: DRN02115102I also think its worth pointing  out that as well as refunding each charge debited,  Black  Horse 
wrote off the sum of £192.17  in late 2016 in order to bring Mr Ls liability  to a close.
Finally it would also appear that Black Horse accepted Mr L might have been struggling  
financially and that it took steps to assist Mr L by, amongst other things, accepting reduced  
monthly payments,  especially after May 2015.
I appreciate Mr L will be disappointed, but taking everything into account I think that Black 
Horse has, in the particular circumstances of this complaint, offered and paid appropriate,  
fair and reasonable compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that Black Horse need do nothing further in respect of this complaint,  it 
having already  paid Mr L £766.87.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2019.
