I attach my provisional decision dated 10 June 2019, which  forms part of this final decision 
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Mr S complaint in part. I invited  both parties to provide any further 
comments they may have  by 24 June 2019  before I reached a further decision.
Neither party has anything to add to my provisional decision findings. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
As neither party has added anything further to the points of the complaint, I see no reason to 
alter the conclusions I reached  in my provisional decision on 10 June 2019. 
I do not uphold  Mr S complaint in relation to Loan  6 and the FlexCredit account. 
Loans 1 to 5 were undisputed having been  conceded by QuickQuid  before  I did my 
provisional decision. For completeness I set out here what QuickQuid needs  to do to put 
things right for those  loans:  
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid in respect Loans  1 to 5 inclusive; and
Ref: DRN83099752apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
the offer from QuickQuid was to remove the credit file entries for these loans and so 
I set that out here as part of the redress for Mr S. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 10 June 2019, I uphold  
Mr S complaint in part. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right for Mr S in the way it offered to do and I have 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 17 August 2019.

background
I have used the information from QuickQuid to create a table which  appears at the end of this 
provisional decision.
When QuickQuid first replied  to Mr S complaint it made an offer in relation to one loan. This was not 
accepted by Mr S and through his representative Mr S brought  his complaint to this service. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at Mr S complaint  and his view was that QuickQuid ought  to put 
things right in relation to Loans  1 to 7.
QuickQuid agreed with most of our adjudicators opinion and accepted that it ought to put things right 
for Loans 1 to 5. But it did not agree with the uphold views for Loans 6 and 7. So to me it seems that 
Loans 1 to 5 are not in dispute anymore. 
As the complaint remains  unresolved as a whole because Mr S did not wish to accept QuickQuids 
offer for Loans 1 to 5, it has been passed to me for a decision. I plan to review the undisputed loans 
only which are Loans 6 and 7, but they will be considered within the context of the lending  relationship 
as a whole. 
my provisional  findings
Before lending  money  to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether  
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things  a lender could take into account before agreeing  to lend. 
The key element was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being borrowed was 
due to be repaid. 
I think  that the gap between Loans  5 and 6 is significant enough for QuickQuid to approach Mr S 
application for Loan  6 differently to Loan 5. In short, I think it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid 
to have treated  Mr Ss sixth loan application  afresh because  I think this gap wouldve  been big enough 
for QuickQuid  to reasonably believe  there may have been a change  to Mr S financial position. So I 
dont think that QuickQuid needed to have carried out the same types  of checks as it did for the fifth 
loan. 
I realise that Mr S may not agree with this but this is my finding for a gap stretching  from 
20 December 2013 to 8 June 2014. And the Loan 5 approval decision was taken  even earlier  in 
October 2013 which makes the period of time between that loan approval date to the next even 
longer. 
This means  that I think it would have been proportionate for QuickQuid to have carried out checks of 
Mr S income and his expenditure  in June 2014. I say this because this would have been 
proportionate for the Loan 6 application. It was for £300 and two repayments of £75 and £375, one 
month apart, on a declared  income of £1,700.  Mr S had declared his outgoings  as £350 on 8 June 
2014 and so the loan would have appeared affordable to QuickQuid. 
I am planning  not to uphold Mr S complaint in relation to Loan  6.
Ref: DRN83099754Loan 7 was for a FlexCredit account. It was applied for a month  after Loan 6 was repaid and the credit 
limit approved was for £1,100. Mr S declared income was £1,700 and Mr S declared expenditure  had 
increased to £800 each month.  This would effectively have  presented to QuickQuid that Mr S had a 
disposable income  of around £900 each month. 
The FlexCredit  agreement  is structured that the drawdown amounts are repaid within a reasonable 
period  usually ten months. And the agreement sets out a projected scheduled  set of repayment 
figures should Mr S drawdown  the maximum allowed under the agreement  on the first day. These 
appear below for Mr S agreement:  
Payment Date Minimum Monthly Repayment  
22 September 2014 £362.28 
22 October 2014 £353.00 
21 November 2014 £326.00 
22 December 2014 £305.30 
22 January 2015 £277.40 
20 February 2015 £240.50 
20 March  2015 £210.80 
22 April 2015 £199.10 
22 May 2015 £164.00 
22 June 2015 £137.90
So considering Mr S declared income  and outgoings and the highest potential repayment figure  of 
around £362,  decreasing as the months went by, then I think  that this would have looked  affordable to 
QuickQuid.
If QuickQuid had also gone  further  and looked at Mr S other STL commitments around July/August 
2014 then I do not think that it would have made a difference. I say this because  I have looked  at the 
information I have from Mr S and I think that QuickQuid would have seen the other STL commitments. 
But it also would have seen these  would have been covered by the amount  left over after deducting 
from Mr S declared income his declared expenses and the FlexCredit  repayments each month. 
And looking at the way that the FlexCredit account was run it seems to have followed the projected 
pattern of drawdown and repayments. Mr S drew down  £950 within  a few days of the account  
commencing, then a further  £150 on 15 September 2014 which took him to his credit limit. Mr S took 
modest principal amounts (having repaid  some) and repaid  principal and interest in roughly  the same 
sort of structure and pattern as I have set out above. And from October 2014 Mr S drew down no 
more in principal  sums and repaid the debt by March 2015. 
So I am planning not to uphold Mr S complaint about  this FlexCredit account.
