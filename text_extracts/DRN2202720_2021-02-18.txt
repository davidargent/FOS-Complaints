K821x#15Complaint
Mr H complains that CarCashPoint  Limited  (trading as CarCashPoint)  unfairly provided him 
with two logbook  loans. He says he was offered  loans  he couldnt afford.
Mr H has since  complained that CarCashPoint exercised a lack of forbearance  when he ran 
into difficulties making his payments. But this matter is being looked at separately and I want 
to be clear in saying that it doesnt  form part of this complaint.
Background
CarCashPoint provided Mr H with two logbook loans in May 2016. The first was for 
£1,500.00 and was due to be repaid  in 78 weekly instalments of £46.93. Mr H repaid this 
loan in full a week later. A second  loan for £2,000.00  was provided at the end of May 2016. 
This loan was due to be repaid in 18 instalments  of £271.12.  
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Hs complaint. And she explained why she thought  
CarCashPoint made unfair lending decisions when  providing these loans. CarCashPoint  
disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans review. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As well as setting  out the key rules,  
regulations and good industry practice, weve explained how we handle  complaints about 
unaffordable and/or  irresponsible lending on our website. Ive used this approach  to help me 
decide Mr Hs complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything  Ive been provided with, Im upholding Mr Hs 
complaint. Id like to explain why.
Our adjudicator set out why she thought CarCashPoint made unfair  lending  decisions when 
providing these  loans. As CarCashPoint  didnt provide an explanation on why it wanted an 
ombudsmans decision, I dont know what exactly it is it disagreed with in our adjudicators  
assessment or what it thinks  she got wrong.
In any event, CarCashPoint will be aware that the rules and regulations,  in place at the time 
it lent to Mr H, required it to establish whether Mr H could sustainably make  his loan 
repayments. In other words, understand whether Mr H could make  his repayments without 
experiencing financial difficulty or borrowing  further  - not just whether  the loan payments 
were technically  affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  And Ive seen that the 
bank statements, for Mr H, which  CarCashPoint  reviewed  before providing these loans 
showed payments  to a number of debt collectors and that Mr H had gambled in excess of his 
income in the month leading up to these  loan applications.   
As this is the case I think that CarCashPoint ought  to have realised Mr Hs previous  
difficulties with credit were most likely  due to his gambling. In these circumstances, I dont 
think that it was fair and reasonable  for CarCashPoint to conclude that Mr H would more  
likely than not have  been able to make the payments to this loan without difficulty or 
borrowing further. So I think that its decision to lend in these circumstances having been  
provided with what  it was provided  with was unfair.  
Ref: DRN22027202Consequently, and having carefully considered everything provided, I agree with our 
adjudicator that CarCashPoint unfairly  provided  Mr H with both of his logbook  loans. 
What CarCashPoint  should do to put things  right
I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Mr Hs complaint for 
CarCashPoint to put things right by:
refunding the interest, fees and charges Mr H paid as a result of these loans;  
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded  interest, fees and charges 
from the date they were  paid by Mr H to the date of settlement;
removing any adverse information placed on Mr Hs credit  file because of these 
loans.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest.  
CarCashPoint must  give Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint.  CarCashPoint Limited should 
put things right in the way set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 March  2021.
