he couldnt afford to make  the loan repayments. 
background
This complaint is about two payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr K between  April and 
August 2009.  Some of the information QuickQuid has provided about the lending is below:
loan 
numberdate 
startedamount 
borrowedterm (days) date ended
1 19/05/2009 £150 57 16/07/2009
2 05/08/2009 £150 41 outstanding
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr K disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ks 
complaint and Ive explained why below.
why I think QuickQuids lending decisions were reasonable
For both of these loans Mr K needed  to make a payment of around £40 and then one of 
£190 at the end of the term.  
Ref: DRN21089852Ive seen a record  of the information Mr K provided  when he completed his loan application. 
Mr K said he had a monthly income  of £1,500. So I think  it wouldve been reasonable for 
QuickQuid to think that Mr K could  sustainably repay  the loans. 
I havent seen  any further information  that shows its likely QuickQuid was made aware of 
any financial  problems Mr K mightve been having.  Or anything  that wouldve  prompted  it to 
investigate his circumstances  further.  So I think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to rely on 
the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments  QuickQuid did for these loans 
were proportionate. And I think  its decisions to lend were reasonable. So Im not upholding 
Mr Ks complaint about them.  
I can see that Mr K still has an outstanding balance on his loan and Id remind QuickQuid 
about its responsibility to treat Mr K positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 September  2019.
