K821x#15Complaint
Mrs D says CashEuroNet UK LLC irresponsibly lent to her. She also says CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC didnt make the costs  of the loans clear  to her, and led her to believe theyd boost her 
credit rating.
Background
This complaint is about six high-cost short-term loans CashEuroNet  provided  to Mrs D 
between December 2012 and October 2015.  It lent her four payday loans and a similar 
flexible credit product  under the trading name  QuickQuid,  and an instalment loan under the 
trading name Pounds to Pocket.
Mrs Ds lending history is as follows:
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mrs Ds complaint  and thought the loans and top-ups from 
loan 5 onwards  should  not have been  given. CashEuroNet disagreed,  and so the complaint  
was passed to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Ive looked at the record of Mrs Ds contact with CashEuroNet. From that, it looks like it 
wouldve been clear  what the loans would  cost, and Ive not seen anything to show  she was 
told these loans would boost her credit  score.  But I do have concerns with the lending  of the 
loans themselves, which Ill explain below.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:Loan Date  opened Date  closedInitial

Ref: DRN75449712the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mrs D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending, and 
later, the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook  (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ds complaint.
Like our adjudicator, I dont think I have  enough  reason to say that loans 1 to 4 were 
irresponsibly lent. For example, these loans  were not especially large  compared  to Mrs Ds 
reported income, she hadnt been borrowing from CashEuroNet for very long at the time, 
and she didnt have  any history of missed  or late payments  at that point.  There  may have 
been times where CashEuroNet  ought to have done  more  in terms of checks. But from what 
Mrs Ds told us and the evidence I have, it doesnt  suggest those loans were unaffordable, 
and I cant say that proportionate  checks would have revealed anything  that shouldve  lead 
CashEuroNet to decline those loans. 
However, Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of CashEuroNets  lending history with Mrs D, 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so CashEuroNet 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ds case, I agree with our adjudicator  that this 
point was reached by loan 5. I say this because:
Ref: DRN75449713By the time Mrs D asked for loan 5 shed been borrowing from CashEuroNet for a 
lengthy period  and she wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed it. 
Loan 5 was taken out 7 months  after Mrs Ds first. And it was for a much  larger  
amount. Shed taken out a number of top-ups in addition to her initial  loans by that 
point and her borrowing was generally increasing substantially. By loan 5, Mrs D had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to CashEuroNet to effectively service a debt to it over 
an extended period.
There were  gaps  of only a few days between Mrs D repaying one loan and asking to 
borrow again, with the largest  gap being under three weeks. So I dont  think it would 
have been reasonable  for CashEuroNet to conclude that Mrs Ds finances had 
moved on from whatever  situation  had required her previous loans.
By loan 5, Mrs D had been borrowing  regularly  and consistently from CashEuroNet,  
being provided with a new loan within a few days or weeks  of settling  a previous one. 
So CashEuroNet ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs D was having 
to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances, and that Mrs Ds indebtedness was continuing unsustainably.
When Mrs D took out loan 6 she still owed a significant amount on loan 5. It seems 
she actually used  some  of loan 6 to repay  nearly £700 to CashEuroNet  over the 
following couple of days. This also demonstrates the unsustainable  nature of Mrs Ds 
borrowing.
I think that Mrs D lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ds indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and top-ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mrs Ds ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept her in the market for these  
high-cost loans. Mrs D has said that shes had trouble getting mainstream credit 
because of her payday loan history, and she explained that her debt situation caused 
her significant stress and contributed to mental  health issues.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 and 6, and CashEuroNet should put things 
right.
Putting things  right  what  CashEuroNet  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs D paid on loans 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the amount  of borrowing  taken from loan 5 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 and 6 should be removed from 
Mrs Ds credit file.
Ref: DRN75449714 HM Revenue & Customs requires businesses  to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet must  give Mrs D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ds complaint. CashEuroNet UK 
LLC should put things right for Mrs D in the way I set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
