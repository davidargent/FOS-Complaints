The complaint
Ms Js complaint is that National Westminster Bank plc has sent her emails regarding her 
overdraft facility when it cannot offer her any assistance.
 
What happened
Ms J has an overdraft facility on her account with NatWest. Her account is overdrawn the 
majority of the time, so NatWest has been regularly sending her emails detailing how much 
her overdraft is costing her, and saying she should get in touch to discuss what help it might 
be able to offer to reduce her costs. 
Ms J says that when she has contacted NatWest following these emails it has been unable 
to offer her any assistance. Ms M feels that it is unreasonable for NatWest to continue to 
send these emails when it is aware that she is not eligible for any of the help it might offer.
NatWest looked into Ms Js complaint but didnt think it had done anything wrong. It noted 
that the emails are part of its regulatory obligations, and that they contain generic wording 
that is not personalised to individual consumers.
Ms J remained unhappy so she referred her complaint to us. One of our adjudicators looked 
at Ms Js concerns, but she agreed with NatWest that it had acted appropriately in sending 
Ms J the emails. 
Ms J did not accept the adjudicators findings, so her complaint has been referred to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate that Ms J has found the emails from NatWest frustrating. But as NatWest and 
our adjudicator have already explained, NatWest is obliged by the regulator to send these 
kinds of emails to any customers that are regularly making use of their overdraft. The 
purpose of these emails is to ensure that customers are aware of how much their overdraft is 
costing them and that there may be options for reducing their costs and limiting their reliance 
on their overdraft.
And while I understand that, so far, NatWest hasnt been able to offer Ms J any specific 
assistance, such as a lower cost loan, I dont think that means that NatWest should stop 
sending Ms J this kind of correspondence. Circumstances can change after all, and if Ms Js 
situation was to change at all then NatWest may well be able to offer her some kind of 
assistance in future.
I also note that, as well as the suggestion that Ms J call to discuss options for reducing the 
cost of her overdraft, the emails shes been sent also include more generic advice about 
managing her overdraft and other resources that are available  such as debt charities like 
PayPlan.
With all this in mind I dont think it is unreasonable for NatWest to have sent Ms J the emails 
it has, so I wont be asking it to do anything different here.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Ms Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2022.
