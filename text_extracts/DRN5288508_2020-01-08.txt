Our adjudicator felt loans 1 to 4 shouldnt be upheld. Mr A didnt disagree with this opinion  so 
I havent considered  these loans any further. But our adjudicator  partly  upheld Mr As 
complaint and thought the loans  from loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been given. Western  
Circle Ltd disagreed  and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Western Circle Ltd needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried  out proportionate  checks to 
make sure Mr A could  repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Western Circle Ltd should  fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  
These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN52885082the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Western  Circle Ltd was required to 
establish whether  Mr A could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Western Circle Ltds lending history  with Mr A, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Western Circle  Ltd should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Western  Circle Ltd 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
5. I say this because:
At this point Western Circle Ltd ought to have  realised Mr A was not managing to 
repay their loans sustainably. Mr A had taken out 1 to 4 loans within  8 months  and 
Mr A had been indebted to Western Circle Ltd for 10 months. So Western  Circle Ltd  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr A was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his/her  finances  and that 
Mr As indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr As first loan was for £450  and loan 5 was for £650. At this point Western  Circle 
Ltd ought to have  known that Mr A was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  loan 5 onwards  Mr A was remained indebted to Western  Circle Ltd for a further 
15 months or so. 
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Western  Circle Ltd. 
Loan 9 was taken out 23 months after Mr As first. And it was for a larger  amount. 
Ref: DRN52885083Mr A had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Western Circle 
Ltd over an extended  period.
I think that Mr A lost out because Western Circle Ltd continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 5 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr A borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr As ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 9 and Western  Circle Ltd should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Western  Circle  Ltd needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 5 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 5 should be removed  from Mr As 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Western Circle Ltd to take off tax from this interest. 
Western Circle Ltd must give Mr A a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr As complaint. Western  Circle Ltd 
should pay Mr A compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2020.
