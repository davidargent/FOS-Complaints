The complaint
Miss C complains that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter took two payments 
from her in a short period of time when she asked to change her payment date. Shes also 
unhappy that four missed payments have been recorded on her account instead of three.
What happened
Miss C held a loan agreement with RateSetter. At the time of making a payment to the loan 
on 28 December 2020 Miss C asked to change her payment date to 15th of each month.
RateSetter moved the next payment date to 15 January 2021. When Miss C found out that 
her next payment was due only 2 weeks after her last payment, she asked RateSetter to 
change the payment date to 1st of each month.
RateSetter emailed Miss C and advised her that it couldnt move the instalment due on 15 
January and that it would still need to be paid on this date.
Miss C says she didnt receive the email and was caused financial difficulties when the 
payment was taken.  She complained to RateSetter, who said it would arrange for the next 
instalment to be moved to 1 March, and advised Miss C to request a  direct debit indemnity 
claim from her bank so that the payment taken on 15 January could be returned. RateSetter 
advised Miss C that the missed instalment would reflect as arrears on her account and 
would need to be cleared, but that there would be no negative effect on Miss Cs credit file.
A few months later, Miss C arranged a three-month payment holiday. She accepts that 3 
months arrears are shown on her account in relation to this. But shes unhappy that 
RateSetter are reporting 4 months of arrears, despite saying that the January arrears 
wouldnt be reported.
Miss C wants RateSetter to record the correct arrears on her credit file, not to show the 
arrears for January and not to send her missed payment communications in relation to the 
January instalment. 
Our investigator didnt think RateSetter had acted fairly. He said that whilst he didnt think it 
was wrong for RateSetter to have moved the payment date to 15 January 2021, he thought 
RateSetter could have done more to explain this to Miss C and discuss the options with her. 
The investigator said that if RateSetter had discussed the options with Miss C, he thought it 
was unlikely that she would have gone ahead with the change to her payment date. The 
investigator also said that when Miss C contacted RateSetter on 9 January 2021 and asked 
to change the payment date to 1st of each month, it couldve moved the date because this 
was within RateSetters 21 day policy.  The investigator said he didnt think it was fair that 
Miss C had been penalised for the January missed payment and said RateSetter should pay 
compensation of £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
RateSetter didnt agree. It said it had tried to contact Miss C before the payment on 15 
January fell due but received no response. RateSetter said Miss C had previously asked for 
payment date changes totalling 8 days, so the request in January 2021 took the date 
changes over the 21 day policy. RateSetter said it only allowed customers to move the 
payment date by a maximum of 21 days over the whole loan agreement. 
RateSetter said it had advised Miss C that it could set up a payment plan for the missed 
January instalment but hadnt been able to agree this with her. It said it a payment plan had 
been agreed then the arrears letters wouldve stopped. RateSetter said it hadnt reported the 
January missed payment on Miss Cs credit file.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
RateSetter has said that it isnt reporting the missed instalment for January on Miss Cs 
credit file and Miss C has confirmed this. 
The essence of Miss Cs complaint is that RateSetter have recorded four months of arrears 
on her account and have continued to chase her about a missed payment in January 2021. 
Ill focus on this.
Ive looked at what happened leading up to the missed January payment. The change in 
payment date came about at Miss Cs request. She asked for her payment date to be moved 
to 15th of each month. Whilst I dont think RateSetter has done anything wrong by moving 
the payment date to 15th, I think it should have done more to make Miss C aware that the 
next payment date would be 15th January 2021, which was only around two weeks after 
Miss C had made her last payment.
RateSetter has said that it tried to contact Miss C by sending an email about the January 15 
instalment date. It asked Miss C to respond to the email. Miss C has said that she didnt 
receive the email. RateSetter has said that it was sent to the correct email address but that it 
could have gone into junk. I cant be certain whether Miss C received the email or not. But I 
think its likely that she would have responded to the email had she received it. 
In these circumstances, and having received no response from Miss C, I think RateSetter 
could have done more to try and make contact with Miss C, either by sending a further email 
or by telephoning or writing to her. If Miss C had been made aware that her next payment 
was due so soon after the last payment, I think she would have decided not to change the 
payment date. 
Ive also thought about whether RateSetter could have changed the payment date to 15 
February rather than 15 January. It says it couldnt have done this because it would have 
taken the date changes over the 21 day policy. However, I can see from RateSetters final 
response that it offered to arrange for the next instalment payment (after 15 January 2021) 
to be taken on 1 March 2021. This appears to exceed the 21 day policy, which suggests to 
me that the policy is discretionary in any event. 
Looking at what happened, I dont think RateSetter communicated very clearly with Miss C 
about whether the payment date could be moved and when it would be moved to. If 
RateSetter had communicated more clearly, I dont think Miss C would have found herself in 
a position where a payment was missed. As it stands, Miss C has been caused (avoidable) 
distress and inconvenience as a result of whats happened here, and I think its fair to ask 
RateSetter to pay compensation for this service failing. The sum of £150 is fair and 
reasonable.
In relation to missed payments that are being reported internally on Miss Cs account, I dont think RateSetter has made an error here. The January payment was missed for the reasons 
explained above. 
I think RateSetter has acted fairly and reasonably by not reporting the January missed 
payment on Miss Cs credit file. If Miss C agrees a payment plan for the January missed 
payment with RateSetter, or uses the compensation payment Ive awarded here to settle the 
arrears on her account relating to the January missed payment, there wont be any need for 
further missed payment communications to be sent about this payment.  
Putting things right
To put things right, RateSetter must pay compensation of £150 to Miss C.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Retail Money Market Ltd trading as 
RateSetter must take the steps Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 October 2022.
