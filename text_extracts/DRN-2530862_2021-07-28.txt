The complaint
Mr S complains that Virgin Media Mobile Finance Limited wont replace a mobile phone that 
he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement.
What happened
Mr S used a fixed sum loan agreement with Virgin Media Mobile Finance that was entered 
into in December 2017 to pay for a mobile phone. He contacted the supplier in December 
2019 because the phone had stopped working and asked it to replace the phone. It said that 
the twelve month warranty on the phone had ended so any repair or replacement would be 
chargeable. 
Mr S said that the manufacturer had agreed that the phone should be replaced so he 
complained to Virgin Media Mobile Finance. It said that when Mr S purchased the phone it 
was clearly stated that the phone came with a twelve month warranty and, as it was 
purchased in December 2017, it was no longer covered to be replaced or fixed for free. Mr S 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
problems with the phone werent linked to an issue at the point of sale and occurred outside 
the warranty period so it wouldnt be fair to say that Virgin Media Mobile Finance had an 
obligation to replace the phone for free. 
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that he didnt know that he was entering into a loan agreement, the manufacturer has said 
that the phone should be replaced and the phone should be expected to last for the 36 
months that he was paying for it under the loan agreement. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr S bought a new mobile phone, the price of which was £1,296, and Virgin Media 
Mobile Finance says that he entered into a fixed sum loan agreement, which was 
interest free, to pay for the phone by 36 monthly repayments of £36;
I havent been provided with a signed copy of the loan agreement but its clear that 
Mr S bought a phone, he didnt pay for the phone at that time, hes being making loan 
repayments of £36 each month and hes received annual account statements from 
Virgin Media Mobile Finance which refer to the fixed sum loan agreement and the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974;
I consider that Mr S knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that he was entering 
into a loan agreement to pay for the phone and that he agreed to make 36 monthly 
repayments of £36 to Virgin Media Mobile Finance;
Virgin Media Mobile Finance says that the phone had a twelve month warranty which 
had expired by the time that Mr S contacted it about the fault with his phone in 
December 2019  Ive seen no evidence to show that the phone had a warranty for 
longer than twelve months;
Mr S paid for the phone using credit provided by Virgin Media Mobile Finance so, in 
certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives him a right 
to claim against it for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about Virgin Media Mobile Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the phone and that Virgin Media Mobile Finances response to his claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ss 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the supplier was responsible for ensuring that the phone was of satisfactory quality 
when Mr S bought it and the breach of contract about which hes complaining is that 
it wasnt of satisfactory quality at that time;
satisfactory quality includes durability which means that the phone and the 
components within it must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time;
Mr S took the phone to a manufacturers store in December 2019 and a fault was 
identified but the report says that the phone was out of warranty and would need 
replacing;
Mr S says that he was told that it was a manufacturing fault and that Virgin Media 
Mobile Finance should replace the phone  but Ive seen no evidence that the 
manufacturer or Virgin Media Mobile Finance has identified a manufacturing fault or 
had agreed to replace the phone without charge;
the phone was inspected by a Virgin Media Mobile Finance technician in January 
2020 and a fault was found but it said that the repair needed would cost £660 and 
wasnt covered by the phones warranty;
Virgin Media Mobile Finance offered Mr S a new contract for a new phone but he 
didnt consider that its offer was fair as hed being paying for the phone for 22 months 
and, as the contract was for 36 months, he felt that it should work for at least 36 
months;
Mr S had entered into a loan agreement for 36 months but I dont consider that there 
was any requirement that the phone would work for 36 months  the phone was 
supplied with a twelve month manufacturers warranty and not a 36 month warranty;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the phone wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr S or that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation about the phone;
Mr S continued to make the monthly payments under the loan agreement until the 
loan was repaid in December 2020 and I consider that Virgin Media Mobile Finances 
response to him has been fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr S that his phone has developed a fault, but Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Virgin Media Mobile Finance to 
repair or replace the phone, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action 
in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2021.
