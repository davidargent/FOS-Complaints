K821x#15Complaint
Mr S complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr S took one running credit account and then 47 instalment loans.  Ive included some  of the 
information weve received about these loans in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Loan 1 was a running  credit facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans that 
Mr S took afterwards. 
The RCF allows a consumer to either request  funds  up to their agreed  credit limit in one go 
or take multiple  drawdowns up to their limit. Mr S had a credit limit of £150.  Each  drawdown  
could be repaid via five monthly instalments. 
In our latest  assessment our adjudicator thought it was wrong for Sunny to have granted  the 
RCF and loans 9 to 48. 
Neither Mr S nor Sunny  have replied  to the latest  adjudicators view. But, Sunny has already 
accepted that something may have  gone wrong  when  it provided loans 15 to 48, so it agreed 
to refund interest  on these loans together with 8% simple interest. It also agreed to update 
Mr Ss credit  file. Mr S didnt accept this offer when it was made. When  Sunny  sent its final 
response about the complaint it had upheld the RCF but this decision was later reversed 
when it made the offer for loans 15 to 48.  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr S doesnt  appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt  wrong to 
lend loans 2 to 8. It seems therefore  that these loans arent in dispute and so I no longer 
think that I need to make  a finding about them. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny should  have lent loans 15 to 48 as it has already 
agreed it shouldnt.  But for clarity Ive set out how Sunny should update Mr Ss credit  file for 
these loans.    
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted the 
RCF and loans 9 to 14. But I have kept the other  lending in mind  when  thinking  about the 
overall lending  relationship between  Sunny and Mr S. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to check  if Mr S could afford  to pay back  
the amounts hed borrowed without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which  was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could  have taken  into account a number  
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Ss 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  stages  of a lending  
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN83967012But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr S. These  factors include:
Mr S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet  a higher repayment from a particular  level of income);  
Mr S having a large  number  of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr S coming back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid  
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr S.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his instalment loans  
not just whether he technically had enough  money to make  the repayments. Having enough  
money to make the repayments could of course  be an indicator that Mr S was able to repay  
the loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. The Financial 
Conduct Authority  (the industry regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC) that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in 
particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable  commitments and without having 
to borrow to make them.  If a lender realises,  or ought reasonably  to have realised, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows  
that it should conclude those repayments  are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ss complaint.
loan 1- the Running Credit Facility
I agree  with our adjudicator that Sunny was wrong  to lend the RCF. As the adjudicator has 
pointed out, Mr S declared an income  of £1,257 and Sunnys credit  check  at the point he 
applied for this facility  revealed that his credit expenditure was likely  to have been £1,558.
Mr S may also have had other regular outgoings.  But even if he didnt,  the evidence  
indicates his credit expenditure exceeded  his income at this time. So, I think its fair to say 
that its most  likely  Mr S was unable to affordable any of the repayments he was committed 
to making. So, I dont think therefore  Sunny  should  have lent it.     
loans 9 to 48 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, I agree with our 
adjudicator that Sunny  should  reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided  loan 9. I say this because:
By loan 9 it was over eight months  into the lending relationship with either short or no 
breaks between loans. Some of the loans also overlapped. In my view,  Mr Ss loan 
Ref: DRN83967013history up until this point was a clear  indication that his underlying financial situation 
didnt seem to be improving; 
Mr S took some loans  shortly after having repaid previous ones. For example, loans 
4 and 6 were taken  out shortly after repayment  of loans 3 and 5 respectively. And 
there was no gap at all between loans 2 and 3 as loan 2 was repaid and loan 3 taken 
out on the same day. 
So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely  than not Mr S, on these 
occasions, was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole the repayment of the 
previous loans had left in his finances  and that this was indicative of his indebtedness  
not being sustainable;
The loan amounts and drawdowns  under the RCF were  broadly similar ranging  
between £100  and £200. I think its most likely this consistent pattern of borrowing 
over the period showed that Mr S didnt just have a short-term cash-flow problem  but 
was probably supporting regular living expenses or other financial commitments,    
Mr Ss lending  history was prolonged with loans  being taken out for almost  four 
years. The amount  of time that Mr S spent indebted to Sunny meant that he was 
servicing a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out when Sunny provided  loans  9 to 48 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about  loans 9 to 48. And Ive set out what  Sunny  should 
do to put things right as detailed below.
Ref: DRN83967014Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loan 1 and loans 9 to 48;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 1 from Mr Ss credit file;
remove loans 9 to 48 from Mr Ss credit file entirely, this is because  the period of time 
Mr S owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax it has taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ss complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should  put things right for Mr S as set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
