The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wouldnt help him recover funds from 
a PayPal transaction after he told it that he hadnt received the item hed purchased.
What happened
In late 2019, Mr B paid a deposit for a car using his PayPal account. He says he paid the 
balance by bank transfer. 
Mr B says he understood there were issues with shipping the car due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. He was communicating with the seller for around 18 months, but this stopped. He 
was unable to contact the seller and he never received the vehicle.
Mr B tried to recover the deposit via PayPal. But PayPal wouldnt agree to refund the money. 
It said it had determined there was no unauthorised use.
In response to Mr Bs complaint, PayPal said that his unauthorised claim was refused 
because there was no evidence of third-party access to his PayPal account. It said the 
transaction was ineligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer protection because hed 
made a personal payment, using PayPals friend and family functionality.
Mr B remained unhappy and asked our service to consider the matter. Our investigator 
looked into Mr Bs concerns but didnt think his complaint should be upheld. He thought 
PayPal had acted fairly and in line with the terms of its user agreement.
Mr B disagreed with our investigators view. He provided copies of email correspondence 
with the seller of the car and with third parties to evidence that hed been defrauded by the 
seller. Mr B said PayPal hadnt made any attempts to satisfy itself that there was no fraud. 
He felt PayPal was condoning fraud by refusing to act on it. So, the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Bs complaint. Ill explain why.
Its unclear why PayPal initially considered Mr Bs claim as an unauthorised claim. Mr B 
has confirmed that he intended to make the payment to the recipient using his PayPal 
account. So, I think its clear that the transaction was authorised. 
PayPal offers some protection to its customers through its buyer protection scheme for items 
not received or significantly not as described. 
However, PayPals user agreement states that some items are not eligible for PayPal Buyer 
Protection. These include vehicles and personal payments including payments sent using 
PayPals friend and family functionality - which is what Mr B used.  
So, I think it was fair for PayPal to conclude that the transaction Mr B made wasnt covered 
under its buyer protection scheme.
Mr B has told us that he was able to recover the balance of what he paid for the car from his 
bank. So, I can understand why he feels that he should also be able to recover the deposit 
from PayPal. However, PayPal isnt a bank, which means that it operates differently and has 
different obligations to its customers.
Its unclear whether the seller intended to defraud Mr B from the start or whether the matter 
is actually a civil dispute, which isnt something PayPal would be responsible for putting 
right. 
I understand Mr B believes hes a victim of fraud and that PayPal should have tried to 
recover the funds for him. Its good industry practice for a financial business to try to recover 
funds if theres evidence that a customer is a victim of fraud or a scam. But if its the case 
that the seller intended to defraud Mr B from the outset, it seems unlikely that the funds 
would have been kept in the recipients account for any length of time. And Mr B appears to 
have raised the issue with PayPal around two years after the transaction. So, I dont think its 
likely that PayPal would have been able to recover the funds if it had attempted to do so.
I appreciate Mr B is unhappy that PayPal wont share the details of the recipient of the funds 
with him so he can pass this information on to the police. But PayPal wouldnt be able to 
share these details with Mr B for data protection reasons. However, PayPal might be 
obligated to share this information with the police if they were to approach it directly, as part 
of a criminal investigation into the matter.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2022.
