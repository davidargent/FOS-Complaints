In the most recent view,  our adjudicator  upheld  Mr Ps complaint and thought the loans from 
loan 7 onwards  shouldnt  have been given because  proportionate checks would have shown 
Mr P was struggling to manage his money. Sunny disagreed but offered  to uphold Mr Ps 
complaint about  loans  15 and 16. We didnt hear back  from Mr P about  this offer.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN69112482But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny had carried out proportionate checks  for loans 1 to 6. Mr P 
didnt respond  to the view. As there appears  that there is no longer a dispute about  these  
loans, I wont be making  any further findings on them. 
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 7 to Mr P and the results of these  checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ps seventh loan in just over a month, I think 
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Ps finances  before 
lending him this loan. 
I say this because  the behaviour of Mr Ps borrowing was an indication that he was having 
problems managing his money.  He had taken  out seven loans in rapid  succession.  In the 
space of just three weeks Mr P had obtained  four loans from Sunny, with loan 6 being  taken 
out just the day before  loan 7 was taken. Loans 5 and 6 were still outstanding when loan 7 
was taken out, which would have been  increasing Mr Ps monthly  outgoings. 
Mr P was also repaying his loans  early. Loans 1, 3 and 4 were all repaid on the same day. I 
appreciate the early  repayment of a loan can save on interest payments. But it can equally 
Ref: DRN69112483be a sign that Mr P wasnt managing his money and was juggling his borrowing to make up 
for a shortfall in his finances.  On a few occasions  Mr P borrowed on the same day hed 
repaid loans early. Again  I think Sunny should have been concerned by this for similar 
reasons. 
Additionally, Mr P had been in debt with Sunny  almost continuingly  during this period. Each 
time Mr P had repaid a loan, he needed  to borrow again within  a matter of days. It was likely  
this behaviour of indebtedness was becoming  increasingly  more  difficult  to sustain and 
Sunny ought to have been concerned about  that. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 7 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 7 to 16 from Mr Ps credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr P a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 April 2020.
