K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain  that Santander  UK Plc has shortened the preferential period of a 
fixed rate mortgage  product they agreed  to in 2017.  They say it should  have  run for two 
years from completion, but instead  it ended nearly  three months before then.
background
In January 2017 Mr and Mrs P applied for a mortgage with Santander.  The mortgage 
completed on 22 June  2017 and was on a fixed rate of 1.29%, running until 2 April 2019.
Mr and Mrs P complained to Santander in February 2019 saying theyd been told their 
mortgage rate was coming to an end, but it shouldnt be ending  until June 2019 (two years 
after completion).
Our investigator didnt  think Santander  had done  anything wrong, and explained the rate had 
a set end date. Mr and Mrs P didnt  agree  and so the complaint has been  passed to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I trust Mr and Mrs P wont take it as a 
discourtesy that Ive condensed their complaint  in the way that I have. Although  Ive read 
and considered the whole file Ill keep my comments to what  I think  is relevant. If I dont 
comment on any specific point its not because Ive not considered it but because I dont 
think I need to comment  on it in order to reach the right outcome. 
This service is impartial between, and independent  from,  consumers and businesses. What  
this means is that we dont represent  either party, and I dont act under eithers  instructions  
or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at or what  questions  should be asked 
and answered.
The fixed  rate Mr and Mrs P applied for was always due to end on 2 April 2019. That was 
explained in the contractual mortgage  offer of 19 April 2017 and the illustration of 
9 January 2017. It didnt matter whether the mortgage completed in January 2017 or June 
2017, the fixed rate would always run until 2 April 2019. That was also explained  twice  to 
Mrs P in the phone call on 9 January 2017.
Some lenders offer their fixed rates for a set time period (such as 24 months), others  offer 
their fixed  rates until a set date in time (such as until 2 April 2019). Neither is right or wrong, 
and both are completely  acceptable ways to set up a fixed rate, provided the documentation 
sets out the details clearly. Its clear from the mortgage offer and illustration in this case that 
the fixed rate would end on a set date regardless  of when it started and Mr and Mrs P 
accepted that offer.
Mr and Mrs P say they assumed theyd be completing in April 2017 so didnt notice anything 
wrong but that doesnt make sense.  The mortgage  illustration (from January 2017) clearly  
states its based on an assumed completion  date of 3 February 2017 (not April 2017), that 
the rate runs until 2 April 2019 and on that basis theyd make  26 payments at the fixed rate. 
Whereas the mortgage offer (from April 2017)  clearly states  its based  on an assumed 
Ref: DRN26432822completion date of 3 May 2017  (again, not April 2017),  that the rate runs until 2 April 2019 
and on that basis  theyd make 23 payments at the fixed rate. 
Both these  documents clearly show the fixed rate is until a set date, that is 2 April 2019 and 
that the number  of payments at the fixed rate will vary depending upon  when  the mortgage 
completes. Its not written  in small print or hidden away; its shown as a key feature of the 
mortgage product  and written in the section where  the monthly mortgage repayments are set 
out.
Mr and Mrs P sent a lengthy  response to our investigators view and whilst Ive read 
everything theyve said I dont intend to respond  in the same  terms. Thats  because  the 
things theyve said in that email that Santander  didnt do (and should  have done) are, quite 
simply, things Santander had no regulatory  requirement to do. Santander did everything it 
was required to do and set the terms of the contract out in a way thats prescribed by the 
regulator. For all the reasons  given Ive got no reasonable grounds to uphold  this complaint.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means well not be engaging  in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision  before  11 December  2019.
