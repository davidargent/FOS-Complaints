The complaint
Mrs T complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) made mistakes when she applied for a second 
payment holiday on her credit card account, which led to her owing more in arrears than she 
thought she did. Mrs T also wasnt aware her loan was on a paydown plan.    
What happened
Mrs T holds a credit card account with NewDay. 
In March 2020, Mrs T contacted NewDay to request a payment holiday. Her household 
income had been adversely affected by the impact of the global pandemic. NewDay agreed 
a payment holiday for three months and wrote to her confirming that her next payment would 
be due on 16 July 2020. 
Mrs T called NewDay again three days before her next payment was due. Her financial 
situation hadnt improved, so she requested an extension of the payment holiday agreed. 
NewDay agreed a further payment holiday. They wrote to Mrs T confirming that her next 
payment would be due on 16 October 2020.
NewDay wrote to Mrs T again on 19 October 2020. They said shed missed a payment of 
£217.28 and needed to make this as soon as possible. Mrs T didnt think this was right. She 
thought the second payment holiday had been agreed for three months and she wouldnt 
need to pay anything until November 2020. 
Mrs T contacted NewDay to complain. NewDay sent her copies of statements and letters 
sent previously. Mrs T found their content distressing and told NewDay shed planned to call 
them in November 2020 to reinstate her payment direct debit. She thought the payment 
holiday had ended too soon. She also wasnt aware she had a payment plan in place for the 
amount she owed on her account. 
NewDay agreed that when she called them in July 2020, they hadnt explained clearly how 
the new payment holiday would work and what payments were due. They said that because 
a statement had been issued, payment was due as soon as the payment holiday ended. But 
they hadnt received that payment. NewDay apologised they hadnt explained this clearly 
and paid compensation of £55.
NewDay also said theyd previously written to Mrs T about her account being in persistent 
debt. Because of this, the balance she owed had been moved to a PayDown Plan over 48 
months. As Mrs T said she wasnt aware, NewDay sent her copies of their previous letters 
about this.
In November 2020, Mrs T contacted NewDays collections department about her situation. 
They agreed a further one-month payment holiday expiring on 16 December 2020. 
Mrs T complained to NewDay again in January 2021. She wasnt happy about the amount 
NewDay said she needed to pay. Theyd said she needed to pay £434.56 which was more 
than she thought. Mrs T thought the larger amount was due to errors made by NewDay 
when they agreed the payment holidays. 
NewDay wrote to Mrs T in response to her complaint. They didnt agree theyd made a 
mistake. They said that the higher payment included arrears from her previous statements. 
And while Mrs T had made a payment of £217.28, this meant those arrears were still 
outstanding.
Mrs T didnt agree with NewDays findings and remained unhappy. So, she referred her 
complaint to this service. Having investigated Mrs Ts complaint, our adjudicator didnt think 
NewDay needed to do anything more. Our adjudicator agreed with the payment amount 
NewDay said was due.
Mrs T didnt agree with our adjudicators findings. She thought NewDays explanations to this 
service differed from what shed been told. So, as an agreement couldnt be reached, Mrs 
Ts complaint has been passed to me to consider further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders in April 2020 which 
explained what they expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances arising 
out of the global pandemic. They provided guidance asking businesses to consider payment 
deferrals of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
Further guidance was issued by the FCA in July 2020. This extended these measures, and 
where consumers were still struggling due to the global pandemic, businesses were advised 
to freeze or reduce their payments for a further three months.
In September 2020, the FCA announced that the support scheme would change from the 
end of October 2020. From then, firms could continue to support customers in difficulty. But 
it was down to their discretion and customers circumstances. Reporting to credit reference 
agencies was reintroduced for people that had already had the maximum payment deferrals.
First payment holiday
The first payment holiday was agreed on 25 March 2020 and confirmed in a letter to Mrs T. 
They said, If there were any amounts due at the time the payment holiday started, you will 
have to pay these immediately when the payment holiday ends. NewDay had sent a 
statement to Mrs T before then dated 16 March 2020. It said she needed to pay £221.74 by 
2 April 2020. Agreement of the payment holiday meant payment of that amount was deferred 
until 16 July 2020. I think this appears to meet the requirements of the FCAs special 
guidance.
Second payment holiday
NewDay confirm Mrs T called them on 13 July 2020 requesting an extension to the payment 
holiday. NewDay have said they werent able to agree an extension to the payment holiday. 
So, they agreed a new payment holiday instead, expiring on 16 October 2020. But they 
admit this wasnt properly explained to Mrs T. They confirmed the new holiday in a letter to 
Mrs T dated 20 July 2020. But this was after a new statement had been issued on Mrs Ts 
account dated 16 July 2020. It said she needed to pay £217.28 by 3 August 2020. This was 
in addition to what had already been deferred. So, ordinarily Mrs T would need to have paid 
£221.74 on 16 July 2020 and £217.28 by 3 August 2020. But as a new payment holiday had 
been agreed, these wouldnt need to be paid until 16 October 2020.
To put things right, NewDay adjusted the arrears on Mrs Ts account so that she would only 
need to pay £217.28 on 16 October 2020. They also paid compensation of £55 by way of an 
apology. I think this was the right thing to do here and the compensation paid feels fair, in 
these circumstances.
Second payment holiday expiryMrs T thought her second payment holiday expired in November 2020. On this point, Im 
unable to agree. NewDays letter of 20 July 2020 was clear about when the holiday expired. 
And they wrote to her again on 6 October 2020 to remind her of this. So, Im not persuaded 
that the payment holiday had been agreed for longer. If NewDays letter differed from what 
Mrs T understood, she had the opportunity to discuss and clarify this with them.
The next statement issued by NewDay was dated 16 October 2020. It said Mrs T needed to 
pay arrears immediately of £217.28. This was the amount requested in the statement dated 
16 July 2020 which had been deferred under the second payment holiday. It also said Mrs T 
needed to pay £217.28 by 4 November 2020  her normal payment. So, the total amount 
due was £434.28. But as Mrs T thought the payment holiday was for longer, she didnt pay 
what was due. NewDay sent her an arrears letter dated 2 November 2020 because they 
didnt receive the payment that was due on 16 October 2020. 
Third payment holiday
When Mrs T contacted NewDays collections team, they agreed another new payment 
holiday expiring on 16 December 2020. On that date, Mrs T wouldve needed to pay the 
arrears of £217.28 from the statement of 16 July 2020 plus the £217.28 due from the 
statement dated 16 October 2020.
Mrs Ts further complaint relates to the calculation of this amount. As Ive explained above, I 
believe NewDay did calculate this amount correctly as it relates to statements that had 
already been issued. Once a statement has been issued, the amount is due for payment. I 
realise Mrs T will be disappointed, but I cant reasonably find that NewDay made a mistake 
here when calculating what was owed. 
Pay down plan
Mrs T says she wasnt aware there was a pay down plan in place with NewDay. The rules 
relating to persistent debt on credit cards were brought about following the FCAs Credit 
Card Market Study (CCMS) published in July 2016. The outcome of the study brought about 
changes in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), part of the FCAs handbook. Under 
the new rules, businesses are required to take a series of escalating steps to help customers 
break the cycle of persistent debt and ensure those who cant afford to repay more quickly 
are given help.
NewDay have provided details of the letters they sent to Mrs T as part of their obligations 
under the CONC rule and guidelines. The requirements are that they must tell Mrs T if shes 
paid more in interest, charges and fees in the preceding 18 months than shed paid off her 
borrowing. They should also explain that increasing payments will reduce Mrs Ts borrowing 
costs and encourage her to contact them to discuss her financial circumstances. They 
should warn Mrs T about the implications of reaching a position of 36 months in persistent 
debt. NewDay sent this letter to Mrs T in September 2018.
Theyre also required to complete a further nine-month review of Mrs Ts account and make 
it clear that if Mrs Ts account was still classified as being in persistent debt, theyd present 
her with options to repay her balance more quickly. NewDay wrote to Mrs T about this in 
June 2019.
In January 2020, NewDay wrote to Mrs T explaining they would transfer her debt to a 
paydown plan in two months time. NewDay wrote to Mrs T again in March 2020 as her 
account continued to meet the FCAs definition of persistent debt. They confirmed that Mrs 
Ts balance had been moved to a four year pay down plan. This appears to comply with the 
FCAs rules and guidelines to ensure Mrs Ts debt would begin to reduce over a reasonable 
time period.
While I appreciate Mrs T said she wasnt aware of the pay down plan, the evidence Ive seen 
suggests that NewDay had clearly and regularly communicated the situation to her. I also 
cant reasonably say that they did anything wrong when they moved Mrs Ts account to a pay down plan. Having written to her previously, I think Mrs T had the opportunity to discuss 
any questions or concerns with them.
In summary, while NewDay admit they may not have clearly explained to Mrs T how the 
payment holidays operated, I believe the steps they took to address this were appropriate, 
together with the compensation paid. Ultimately, Mrs T benefitted from the maximum 6 
months of payment deferrals permitted under the FCAs special guidance. But these are only 
deferrals. Upon expiry, amounts due under previously issued statements do immediately fall 
due. 
I also think NewDay met the FCAs requirements for persistent debt when they ultimately 
moved Mrs Ts debt with them to a pay down plan. And I think this was communicated 
clearly to her. In the event Mrs T continues to struggle to meet her financial obligations, I 
would encourage her to seek help and support from both NewDay and any of the free debt 
advisory services available.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
