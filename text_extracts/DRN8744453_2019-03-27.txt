K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains that AFX Markets Limited  unfairly voided some  of the trades he had placed 
on his Contracts for Difference (CFD) trading account.  
background
Between 19:06 and 19:07 on 23 May 2018,  Mr N opened 12 trades in the EUR/TRY 
currency pair (Euro  / Turkish Lira) on AFXs  platform. At around  the same  time, the Turkish  
Central Bank  (TCB) made an announcement which  caused significant volatility in the market  
for this particular currency pair. 
Of the 12 trades Mr N placed, 9 were short trades   in other  words  he would make money if 
the value of the Euro versus the Turkish  Lira went down. These trades were opened and 
closed at the following times:
1)19:06:21 and closed at 19:06:25
2)19:06:23 / 19:06:26
3)19:06:24 / 19:06:32
4)19:06:27 / 19:06:38
5)19:06:49 / 19:07:02
6)19:06:50 / 19:07:04
7)19:07:05 / 19:23:21
8)19:07:06 / 19:23:22
9)19:07:07 / 19:23:23
All 9 trades had the same opening price of 5.60566.The first 6 trades had the same closing 
price as well of 5.62451. They made  small losses of between  £200 and £300. 
The last three trades had different closing  prices, between 5.44803 and 5.47301.  These last 
three trades made around £3,800 profit. 
One of the three long trades was opened  at 19:06:12 and the others were opened 19:06:13 
 these were all opened with the same opening price of 5.62451. And these trades  were  all 
closed a few seconds later (at 19:06:17, 19:06:18 and 19:06:19) at the same closing price of 
5.60566. These three trades made losses of around  £460. 
AFX decided  to void the above trades, so Mr N complained. AFX looked into his complaint, 
but thought it had acted  in line with its terms. In short, it explained that its platform  was 
experiencing a price  freeze at the time and this was evident from the fact that he had opened 
several trades all at the same opening price.  It said that it considered these prices were 
manifest errors, and its terms allowed it to void his trades as a result. 
Mr N didnt agree, and complained to this service.  One of our adjudicators  looked into the 
complaint but didnt  think it should  be upheld. She agreed that there was clearly an issue 
with the pricing  information AFX was receiving at the time, and concluded  that AFX had 
acted in line with its terms by voiding the trades.
Mr N didnt agree with the adjudicator  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. In short,  he 
said:
Ref: DRN87444532He presented documentary evidence from a different broker which  showed  that 
broker honouring certain prices  even though it appeared  that broker  was also 
experiencing a price  freeze. While AFX had only been able to provide prices from 
Bloomberg which Mr N said wasnt as reliable.  
He said the price wasnt actually frozen  the low liquidity at the time caused spreads 
in this currency pair to widen, and this is why the bid/offer prices  stayed the same  for 
a period of time.  
He said that if AFX had adjusted his trades with the prices  it had quoted from 
Bloomberg, he would still have  made a profit. So it wasnt fair that it cancelled  his 
trades altogether.  
As agreement couldnt be reached, the case was passed to me to consider.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I see no reason to depart 
from the adjudicators  conclusions.  
Id like to reassure Mr N that Ive very carefully  considered the points he has made  
throughout the complaint,  and in response  to the adjudicators view. I understand he feels 
very strongly  that it was unfair to void his trades and that, at the very least,  AFX should  
reprice the trades according to what it considers were legitimate  prices at the time. 
The starting point  in deciding Mr Ns complaint is his agreement with AFX. And in particular, 
the clause in his agreement which in principle allowed AFX to take the action that it did. 
Clause 5.13 says:
The parties acknowledge that errors  may occur in the Prices quoted by AFX Capital 
Markets Ltd to AFX UK due to internet or connectivity failures  or delays, price  feed mistakes 
or otherwise resulting  in quoted Prices materially  deviating from market rates. In such 
circumstances, [] neither the Client nor AFX Capital  Markets Ltd will be bound by any 
Contract which purports to have been  made  (whether or not confirmed by AFX Capital  
Markets Ltd) at a Price which was, or ought  reasonably to have been, known to either  the 
Client or AFX Capital  Markets Ltd to be materially incorrect at the time the Contract was 
entered into.
Mr N has made a number of submissions around  why he says its possible for bid/offer 
prices to stay the same  as they did on the evening in question.  In particular, he has said that 
the lack of liquidity in the market caused the spread to widen to such  an extent  that it 
appeared as if the bid and offer prices werent moving. 
I dont dispute  that its possible for this to happen.  But I think  it would be extremely unusual 
for such a wide spread  to persist for around a minute. 
In addition, I think it would be especially unusual for a firm to keep a bid price  so high that it 
guaranteed any short  trades would be immediately profitable given the actual prices  being 
traded in the underlying  market. I think in circumstances where it was clear the price was 
dropping, the wide spread doesnt account  for such manifestly incorrect prices.  
But in any event, AFX has explained that the issue  it was experiencing wasnt  to do with the 
spread  it was to do with its own platform and an issue with the prices it was able to quote. 
Ref: DRN87444533It has provided other pricing evidence which demonstrates that its prices  were clearly not in 
line with the underlying market. I found this evidence persuasive. 
And so in these  circumstances, I think its equally  fair for AFX to have taken  action on the 
trades which were placed on these  clearly incorrect prices. I acknowledge that AFXs terms 
do allow it a certain amount of discretion in deciding whether to void or reprice relevant 
trades. So Ive considered  whether  it has applied  its terms fairly in Mr Ns case. 
In deciding this, in my view, the key question  is whether Mr N knew,  or shouldve known, that 
the price he was trading on was manifestly  wrong.  I think this is key because it goes to the 
heart of his trading relationship with AFX  if a price  is obviously wrong and doesnt  reflect  
where that underlying market is trading, it could skew the risk and reward  ratio unfairly in 
favour of the investor. It means that an investor could open a trade  and essentially make  an 
immediate, risk-free, profit. 
In Mr Ns case, I think it was clear, or shouldve been clear, that the prices AFX was quoting  
were clearly not in line with the underlying market  and the fact that they werent moving at 
all for such  a period  of time only made that more  obvious. 
I say this because  at the time, it was widely reported  that the Turkish Lira was strengthening 
against the Euro and other currencies, and so the EUR/TRY price  was dropping.  But AFXs 
platform was still quoting  the same price.  Mr N was clearly aware of what was happening in 
the market. And Im persuaded he knew, or shouldve known, that the prices he was trading 
at werent correct and were likely  the result of an error on AFXs  platform.  So Im satisfied 
that, as a result, he unfairly profited  from an error on AFXs platform and, in the particular 
circumstances of his case, it follows that I consider AFXs actions were fair and reasonable 
when it voided  his trades.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2019.
