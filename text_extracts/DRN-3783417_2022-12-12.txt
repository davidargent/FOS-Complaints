The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc provided him with incorrect information 
and poor service in relation to his loan account. 
What happened
In April 2018 Mr J took out a personal loan with NatWest. In early 2020 Mr J was struggling 
to make his loan repayments. NatWest agreed to loan deferral periods, and from              
September 2020, NatWest agreed to a forbearance plan of Â£1 a month for three months.
At the end of November 2020, Mr Js loan term was extended, and Mr Js forbearance plan 
was extended for a further three months, which meant that in April 2021 Mr Js loan 
repayments should have returned to normal. But Mr J was unable to resume the standard 
loan repayments, which meant NatWest passed the account over to its collections and 
recovery team.
During the changes that were made to Mr Js loan he had multiple phone calls with NatWest. 
Mr J says that during these calls he was given incorrect information about his loan. 
Essentially Mr J says he was assured his account would be on hold whilst our service 
conducted its review of his complaints. Mr J also complained that when he raised concerns 
about his repayments, he explained he wanted to get his MP involved. But Mr J says 
NatWest dealt with his complaint before he could do this. So, he raised a complaint. 
NatWest looked into Mr Js concerns. It said that Mr Js account had been on hold while a 
previous complaint with this service was reviewed. But, following the Final Decision on that 
case, it continued recovery action as it could not keep the account on hold indefinitely, But it  
apologised for instances of poor service when Mr J had been given conflicting information 
about the hold on his account. It also explained that although Mr J said he would contact his 
MP; it never received any MP contact. And it found that it hadnt suggested Mr J get in touch 
with his MP either. 
Mr J referred his complaint to our service as he remained unhappy with NatWests 
comments. The investigator didnt think Mr Js complaint should be upheld and said they 
thought NatWest hadnt acted incorrectly in the context of this complaint. Mr J disagreed, 
and this matter has been passed to an ombudsman for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I am sorry to hear of the impact the Covid pandemic has had on Mr J and his ability 
to repay his loan. I understand managing his repayments and dealing with NatWest has 
been a source of worry and frustration, at what has already been a challenging time. 
Theres a great deal of correspondence on this complaint  in particular multiple phone calls 
between NatWest and Mr J which I have listened to. If I dont comment on every point Mr J 
has made its not because Ive ignored it - Ive considered all he has told us and provided to 
us, as I have with NatWests submissions. I will focus on issues which are relevant for me to 
reach a fair and reasonable outcome in the circumstances of this complaint. This isnt meant 
as a discourtesy. It simply reflects the informal nature of our service.
Our service has already issued a final decision in relation to Mr Js complaint about the 
repayment of his loan with NatWest. So, I wont be addressing any points that have been 
looked at under that complaint. Instead, I will be focusing on the information Mr J was given 
about this complaint.
MP involvement
Mr J says he was going to contact his MP about his complaint and explained that NatWest 
had also told him to involve his MP with his concerns. Mr J says that he was unable to do 
this as NatWest dealt with the complaint prior to any MP involvement. 
I have listened to the calls between NatWest and Mr J. During these calls its clear that Mr J 
wished to involve his MP as he was unhappy with how NatWest were dealing with him. But 
Ive not found that NatWest told Mr J to contact his MP or that it would contact his MP on his 
behalf. Instead I found that NatWest explained that Mr J was able to contact his MP if he 
wished to. I also havent heard anything within the calls which suggests NatWest indicated 
that the complaint would only be reviewed once MP contact had been made. 
I think it would be helpful to explain that when a customer wants to involve an MP in their 
complaint, it is usually for a customer to contact their MP to discuss their issues. The MP will 
then contact the business setting out their views. In Mr Js case I cant see that NatWest 
ever received contact from an MP, and during the time his complaint has been with our 
service there hasnt been any MP involvement either. 
Overall, Ive not found that NatWest acted unreasonably by continuing with its review of Mr 
Js complaint without MP involvement. 
Recovery action
I can see one of Mr Js key concerns is that he was given conflicting information about 
recovery action on his account whilst our service reviewed his concerns. 
In February 2021 it was agreed by NatWest that recovery and collection action on his 
account would stop whilst Mr Js complaint was considered by this service. However, in 
subsequent conversations with NatWest representatives, Mr J was told that recoveries 
action would continue, as they couldnt see the relevant information about the hold. NatWest 
in its letter of 30 March 2021, accepted it hadnt provided the service it shouldve at this 
stage. It explained that due to the systems in place and the usual process for holds, the 
information about the suspension of account recovery action for Mr J wasnt accessible to 
the representatives he spoke to. 
I can see NatWest apologised for these issues and assured Mr J that the necessary 
feedback would be provided to the relevant members of staff. Mr J was also given the 
correct information once the problem had been identified. I find NatWest took appropriate 
steps here to address Mr Js concerns. And Im satisfied the conflicting information Mr J 
received hasnt been detrimental to his situation. 
I say this because our service issued a final decision in October 2021. Recovery action then 
resumed on the account in line with that final decision. So, Im satisfied that NatWest has acted fairly in continuing with the necessary debt collection action, as our services 
involvement in Mr Js initial complaint had come to an end. 
Ive seen Mr J wanted NatWest to replace the hold on the recovery action when he raised 
this complaint. But it didnt agree. Given the length of time the hold had been in place, Im 
persuaded that delaying the recovery process further was not a feasible option. In general, 
our service expects businesses to act quickly and fairly when carrying out these activities as 
often drawing out the process can have further negative consequences. I understand this 
has been a difficult time for Mr J, but NatWest is entitled to continue with the action in line 
with regulatory guidance.
I know this will not be the outcome Mr J was hoping for and he will be disappointed with the 
decision Ive reached. But I hope my decision provides some clarity around why I wont be 
asking NatWest to take any further action. I would urge Mr J to work with NatWest to agree 
how he will now continue to repay any balance owing on his person loan.  I can see Mr J has 
said that he has contacted the Citizen Advice Bureau and it may be able to work with Mr J 
and NatWest in this respect.       
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
