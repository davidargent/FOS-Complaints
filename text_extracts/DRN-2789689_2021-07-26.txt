The complaint
Mr B complains about the actions of Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as Moneyway, in 
response to his voluntary termination of a hire purchase agreement under which a car had 
been supplied to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr B under a hire purchase agreement with Moneyway that he 
signed in May 2016. He phoned Moneyway about voluntarily terminating the agreement in 
February 2020 and voluntarily terminated it the following month. The car was collected from 
him and inspected by a third party on behalf of Moneyway and damage with a repair cost of 
£255 was identified.
Moneyway charged Mr B £255 for the damage but he said that hed been told that no further 
payments would be required. He complained to Moneyway and asked it to provide him with 
a recording of the February 2020 call. He didnt receive the call recording and Moneyway 
sold his debt to a third party.
Mr B complained to Moneyway that it had sold the debt without answering his complaint 
about the charges. Moneyway said that it had issued a response to his complaint in July 
2020, the debt was sold in October 2020 and its a part of the terms and conditions of the 
agreement that the debt may be sold to a third party. 
Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that Moneyway had made an error 
by not sending Mr B a copy of the call which caused him to wait, but he thought that it was 
fair and reasonable to say that Mr B could have contacted it to inform it that he hadnt 
received the call and that, if hed done so, it was likely that the debt being sold would have 
been postponed.
Mr B has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that 
Moneyway promised him a copy of the phone conversation and was legally bound to supply 
it but failed to deliver it. He says that it then sold the debt to a debt recovery service without 
informing him, which it was legally bound to do, and that it hasnt properly investigated his 
complaint. He feels that Moneyways treatment of him has been poor and it has stepped 
outside of what its required to do.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B phoned Moneyway in February 2020 about voluntarily terminating his 
agreement  Ive listened to a recording of that call and the voluntary termination 
process was clearly explained to him, including that the car would be collected from 
him and inspected by a third party and that he would be liable for damage to the car;
he voluntarily terminated the agreement and the car was collected from him and 
inspected by a third party in March 2020, and damage with a repair cost of £255 was 
identified;
Mr B hasnt complained about the charges so I havent considered whether they were 
fair and reasonable but photos of the damage are included in the inspection report 
and the agreement said that Mr B would:  pay for all  damage to the Vehicle 
even if caused by events beyond [his] control ; other than:   damage due to fair 
wear and tear;
Mr B was charged £255 for the damage by Moneyway so he complained to it 
because he said that hed been told that no further payments would be required;
it sent him a final response to his complaint in July 2020 in which it said that it had 
clearly stated that he would be liable for any damage charges which were identified 
in the inspection report and that a copy of the call recording had been requested and 
he should receive it within 30 days;
the £255 remained outstanding so Moneyway sold the debt to a debt recovery 
company in October 2020 and the debt recovery company contacted Mr B about the 
debt - so he made another complaint to Moneyway;
it said that it had issued a response to his complaint in July 2020, the debt was sold 
in October 2020 and its a part of the terms and conditions of the agreement that the 
debt may be sold to a third party;
Mr B was clearly told in February 2020 that he would be liable for the damage to the 
car when he voluntarily terminated the agreement so I consider that the response 
that Moneyway sent to Mr B in July 2020 was fair and reasonable;
it had said that it would send him a recording of the February 2020 call but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that it did so  but Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mr B 
told Moneyway that he hadnt received the recording that hed requested until he 
contacted it in October 2020 after his debt had been sold to a debt recovery company 
 I consider that it would be fair and reasonable to expect Mr B to have contacted 
Moneyway when he didnt receive the call recording if he was waiting to receive it;
our investigator has sent a recording of the call to Mr B;
the hire purchase agreement, which Mr B had signed and agreed to, says: We may 
assign our rights under this agreement to another person  so I consider that 
Moneyway was entitled to sell the debt to a third party;
Mr B says that the debt shouldnt have been sold because Moneyway hadnt 
answered his complaint  but it had issued its final response letter to Mr B and 
considered that it had dealt with his complaint;
Mr B sent an e-mail to Moneyway in October 2020 after hed been contacted by the 
debt recovery company  so he knew that his debt had been sold to it and hed 
agreed in the hire purchase agreement that Moneyway could assign his debt to a 
third party  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it acted 
incorrectly when it sold his debt to the debt recovery company but I consider that 
Moneyway should have notified Mr B that his debt was being sold;
in that e-mail he said: I believe you have acted entirely incorrectly as we were going 
through a complaint procedure which had not been satisfied  but he didnt tell it that 
he hadnt received the call recording and I consider that its response to his second 
complaint was fair and reasonable  and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that it hadnt properly investigated his complaint; Mr B has said that Moneyway should tell him the amount that it received for the car 
when it was sold at auction  but Im not persuaded that theres any requirement for it 
to provide that information to him  and I dont consider that the selling price of the 
car affects his voluntary termination of the agreement or his liability for any damage 
to the car in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that hes been caused because Moneyway 
didnt send the call recording to him and because it didnt notify him that it had sold 
his debt to a third party  but Im not persuaded that those issues are enough to 
justify me requiring Moneyway to waive the £255 that its charged him for the 
damage to the car, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
Mr B says that he cant afford to pay the charge for the damage. I suggest that he contacts 
Moneyway and tries to agree an affordable payment arrangement for the charge. He should 
explain any financial difficulties that hes experiencing to Moneyway  and its required to 
respond to any such difficulties positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2021.
