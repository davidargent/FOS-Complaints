The complaint
Mrs M complains that a conditional sale agreement, under which a car was supplied to her, 
was misrepresented to her by Cambria Automobiles (South East) Limited. Her husband is 
also involved in her complaint.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs M signed a conditional sale agreement in December 2016 for a new car to be 
supplied to her  she also signed a sales agency agreement and she was provided 
with an explanations documents, pre-contract credit information and an affordability 
notice;
the agreements included an annual mileage limit of 8,000 and its clear that Mrs M 
and her husband discussed the limit with Cambria Automobiles  Mrs M says that 
she was assured that exceeding the limit would only be an issue if she didn't want to 
take ownership of the car and didnt make the final payment that was due at the end 
of the agreement;
she says that she contacted Cambria Automobiles in July 2019 about replacing the 
car with another one but it told her that she wasn't eligible for a new deal as there 
was negative equity on her agreement due to excess mileage on her current car;
she complained to Cambria Automobiles and then to this service but our investigator 
didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld  he considered that the 
mileage limit hadnt been misrepresented to Mrs M;
Mrs Ms husband says that the investigator didnt speak to anyone involved and 
failed to take account of the fact that both he and Mrs M were present when the 
mileage limit was discussed with Cambria Automobiles, the suitability of the balloon 
payment wasnt considered and the paperwork doesnt make it clear that the dealer 
cant offer a new deal if the mileage limit is exceeded;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - we have no regulatory or disciplinary role over 
those businesses so Im unable to require any of them to change the way that it 
conducts its business;
Mrs M was clearly aware of the mileage limit when she signed the agreement  and 
immediately above her signature it says: This agreement is a conditional sale 
agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms;
I consider that the terms on which the car was being supplied to Mrs M were clearly 
set out in the agreement  the price of the car was £15,965, she made an advance 
payment of £1,851, the agreement was interest free and she agreed to make a first 
payment of £215.86, 41 monthly payments of £216.04 and there was a final payment 
 the balloon payment  of £5,040.50;
Mrs M also accepted the annual mileage limit of 8,000  if any of those terms werent 
acceptable to her I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her not to have 
signed the agreement  and if shed asked for a higher mileage limit the payments 
required under the agreement would also have been higher;
I sympathise with Mrs M and her husband for the frustration that they now feel but Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement was 
misrepresented to Mrs M or that Cambria Automobiles has acted incorrectly in its 
dealings with her;
the negative equity that the dealer has referred to is likely to be a result of the 
mileage that has been driven in the car which reduces its value  rather than 
because the mileage limit has been exceeded - and Im not persuaded that the 
mileage limit prevented the dealer from offering a new deal to Mrs M;
I consider that it would be a commercial decision for the dealer as to whether or not 
to offer a new deal to Mrs M - this service wouldnt normally interfere with a business 
legitimate commercial decisions and I see no reason to interfere with the dealers 
commercial decision not to offer a new deal to Mrs M; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Cambria Automobiles to take any action in response to Mrs Ms complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
